# Development Session Summary
**Date:** October 2, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on adding comprehensive records and personal bests tracking to the TEG application, enhancing both the latest TEG/round context pages and the main records page with detailed tracking of achievements across multiple categories.

---

## Initial Task: Page Alignment & Records Analysis

### Request
Review and align functionality between `latest_teg_context.py` and `latest_round.py`, then design a system to identify and display records/personal bests.

### Analysis Completed
Created `temp_analysis.md` with:
1. **Thematic differences** between the two pages
2. **Options for records/PBs identification** (4 approaches analyzed)
3. **Recommendations** - Hybrid approach selected

**Key Decision:** Option 3 (Hybrid Approach) - Use existing rank data from tables, minimal computation overhead, clean display.

---

## Phase 1: Page Structure Updates

### Latest TEG Context Page (`latest_teg_context.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added main tab structure: `Aggregate Score | Scoring | Streaks | Records & PBs`
- Moved existing metric tabs under "Aggregate Score"
- Added "Scoring" tab (TEG-level scoring breakdown)
- Added "Streaks" tab (cumulative streaks across all rounds)

### Latest Round Page (`latest_round.py`)
**Changes:**
- Already had 4 tabs: `Scoreboards | Scorecard | Scoring | Streaks`
- Added 5th tab: `Records & PBs`

### Format Standardization
**Fixed:** GrossVP/NetVP formatting in context tables
- Changed `0` display to `=` using `format_vs_par()` function
- Updated both `chosen_rd_context()` and `chosen_teg_context()` in `utils.py`

---

## Phase 2: Records & Personal Bests System

### New Helper File Created
**File:** `streamlit/helpers/records_identification.py`

**Functions Implemented:**

1. **`identify_aggregate_records_and_pbs()`**
   - Scans for `Rank_within_all_[metric] = 1` (all-time records)
   - Scans for `Rank_within_player_[metric] = 1` (personal bests)
   - Identifies personal worsts (max rank within player)
   - Covers: Score, GrossVP, NetVP, Stableford

2. **`identify_all_time_worsts()`**
   - Identifies worst-ever performances
   - Uses existing rank columns but checks for maximum rank

3. **`identify_9hole_records_and_pbs()`**
   - Checks Front 9 and Back 9 for records/PBs
   - Round page only

4. **`identify_streak_records()`**
   - Compares displayed streaks against all-time records
   - Uses `prepare_record_best_streaks_data()` and `prepare_record_worst_streaks_data()`
   - Covers: Eagles, Birdies, Pars, No +2s, Over Par, TBPs

5. **`identify_score_count_records()`**
   - New functionality for score count records
   - Categories: Eagles, Birdies, Pars (all include better scores), TBPs
   - Checks both TEG and Round levels
   - Uses `count_scores_by_player()` helper

6. **`get_all_time_score_count_record()`**
   - Helper to find historical max counts
   - Supports both round-level and TEG-level analysis

7. **`display_records_and_pbs_summary()`**
   - Clean display component with sections:
     - üèÜ All-Time Records (Bests)
     - üíÄ All-Time Records (Worsts)
     - ‚≠ê Personal Bests (grouped by player)
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Personal Worsts (grouped by player)

### Integration
Both `latest_teg_context.py` and `latest_round.py` now call all identification functions and display results in the Records & PBs tab.

---

## Phase 3: Main Records Page Enhancement

### Score Counts Tab Added
**File:** `streamlit/300TEG Records.py`

**New Tab:** "Score Counts" (5th tab alongside TEG/Round/9-Hole/Streaks)

### New Function in Display Helpers
**File:** `streamlit/helpers/display_helpers.py`

**Function:** `prepare_score_count_records_table(all_data)`

**Records Displayed:**

#### Best Score Counts:
1. Most Eagles in a TEG
2. Most Eagles in a Round
3. Most Birdies in a TEG
4. Most Birdies in a Round
5. Most Pars in a TEG
6. Most Pars in a Round

#### Worst Score Counts:
7. Most TBPs in a TEG
8. Most TBPs in a Round

### Smart Consolidation Feature
**Problem:** When 4+ players share a record, table became cluttered with duplicate rows

**Solution Implemented:**
- **3+ tied records:** Consolidated into one row
  - Player column: `‚Üí` (right arrow)
  - When column: Deduplicated player initials (e.g., `JB / SN / JP / DM`)
- **1-2 tied records:** Show each separately with full details

**Example:**
```
Before:
Most Eagles in a TEG  1  JB  TEG 4 (East Sussex, England, 2011)
Most Eagles in a TEG  1  SN  TEG 12 (Catalonia, Spain, 2019)
Most Eagles in a TEG  1  JP  TEG 13 (Kent, England, 2020)
Most Eagles in a TEG  1  DM  TEG 15 (Lisbon Coast, Portugal, 2022)

After:
Most Eagles in a TEG  1  ‚Üí  JB / SN / JP / DM
```

### Deduplication
**Problem:** Players appearing multiple times (e.g., `HM / DM / DM / JB / GW / JB / GW`)

**Solution:** Implemented order-preserving deduplication using set tracking
- Result: `HM / DM / JB / GW`

### Title Cleanup
**Changed:**
- `"Birdies (or better)"` ‚Üí `"Birdies"`
- `"Pars (or better)"` ‚Üí `"Pars"`

**Added:** Caption at bottom of tab: *"Eagles, Birdies and Pars also include better scores"*

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. `streamlit/helpers/records_identification.py` (640 lines)
2. `temp_analysis.md` (484 lines)

### Modified Files
1. `streamlit/300TEG Records.py` - Added Score Counts tab
2. `streamlit/helpers/display_helpers.py` - Added `prepare_score_count_records_table()`
3. `streamlit/latest_round.py` - Added Records & PBs tab, all record identification
4. `streamlit/latest_teg_context.py` - Restructured tabs, added Records & PBs
5. `streamlit/utils.py` - Fixed GrossVP/NetVP formatting in context functions
6. `.claude/settings.local.json` - Settings updates

---

## Technical Highlights

### Data Flow
1. Load ranked data (already contains `Rank_within_all` and `Rank_within_player` columns)
2. Filter to selected TEG/round
3. Scan rank columns for rank=1 (records) or rank=max (worsts)
4. Load additional data for score counts and streaks
5. Consolidate and format for display

### Performance Optimization
- Reuses existing computed ranks (no duplicate calculations)
- Efficient lookups using existing dataframes
- Minimal overhead added to page load

### Display Features
- Clean, consistent table formatting matching existing records style
- Smart consolidation prevents table clutter
- Grouped personal bests/worsts by player for readability
- Clear visual indicators (üèÜ, üíÄ, ‚≠ê, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚Üí)

## Git Commit

**Commit:** `093cd0a`
**Message:** "Add comprehensive records & personal bests tracking"

**Stats:**
- 7 files changed

- 5 deletions(-)

**Pushed to:** GitHub `main` branch

## Testing Completed

All pages tested and verified working:
- ‚úÖ `latest_teg_context.py` - All tabs functional
- ‚úÖ `latest_round.py` - All tabs functional including 9-hole records
- ‚úÖ `300TEG Records.py` - Score Counts tab displaying correctly
- ‚úÖ Consolidation logic working (3+ records ‚Üí single row)
- ‚úÖ Deduplication working (no duplicate player initials)
- ‚úÖ Arrow symbol displaying correctly

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tab Structure:** Moved records to dedicated tab (cleaner than expander)
2. **Hybrid Approach:** Use existing rank data rather than recalculating
3. **Consolidation Threshold:** 3+ tied records (1-2 shown separately for context)
4. **Display Symbol:** `‚Üí` arrow (cleaner than `..`)
5. **Title Simplification:** Move "(or better)" to caption
6. **Deduplication:** Order-preserving to maintain first-occurrence order

---

## Future Considerations

### Not Implemented (As Discussed)
- Scoring pattern records (most eagles/fewest bogeys per specific event)
- Historical context beyond rank (e.g., "3rd best ever")
- Personal best/worst streaks
- Scorecard-specific records

### Potential Enhancements
- Could add "Latest Round/TEG" reset buttons to both pages for consistency
- Could standardize table CSS classes (full-width) across both pages
- Could add cumulative charts to TEG context (currently skipped as redundant)

---
