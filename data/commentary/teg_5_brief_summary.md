# TEG 5: Baker Claims Trophy, Mullin Dominates Gross

**Algarve, Portugal (2012)** — Jon Baker won his second TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance across Boavista and Palmares, holding off Gregg Williams by 3 points after a dramatic final-round duel. David Mullin claimed his fourth Green Jacket with a crushing 54-stroke margin—leading all 72 holes—but earned his first Wooden Spoon with 136 Stableford points.

Baker seized the Trophy lead in Round 1 and never trailed after reclaiming it on the opening hole of Round 4, surviving five lead swaps with Williams before pulling clear with birdies on holes 13, 14 and 15. Williams' challenge ended on the 16th when a quintuple bogey sealed his fate, finishing with 153 points. Stuart Neumann vaulted from last to fourth overall with a career-best Round 2 performance: 45 points including an 11-point explosion from holes 8-10.

Mullin's gross dominance was historic—12 strokes under par in Round 1, never trailing, winning by 54 over Baker—yet his Stableford collapse (27 points in Round 3, his personal worst) left him three points behind fourth-place Neumann in the Trophy standings.
