**TEG 6 - Catalonia, Spain (2013)**

Gregg Williams claimed his second Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance, leading all 72 holes to win by 3 points over Jon Baker. David Mullin took his fourth Green Jacket by 4 strokes, leading the Gross competition for 62 holes despite finishing 10 points behind Williams in Stableford. Four new championship courses tested the field across Costa Brava and Barcelona: PGA Catalunya's Tour and Stadium layouts, Costa Brava, and El Prat Rosa.

Williams posted the tournament's worst round on Sunday—28 points with six blow-ups—yet survived multiple lead changes to edge Baker by 3 points. Baker's agonizing double runner-up finish included a catastrophic H9 meltdown (10 strokes, +6) that cost him the Jacket lead. Mullin reclaimed the Jacket on that hole and held firm despite blow-ups on the closing stretch.

Henry Meller earned his first Wooden Spoon with 123 points after posting back-to-back nightmares in rounds 3-4 (25 and 26 points). His week featured 12 blow-ups, including three disasters of +5 or worse: twin 10s at R3 H1 (+5) and H8 (+6), plus R4 H1 (+5). The field recorded 52 total blow-ups across 360 holes—averaging over 10 per player.
