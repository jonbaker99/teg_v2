## TEG 6: Catalonia, Spain (2013)

Gregg Williams claimed his first Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory by 3 points over Jon Baker, surviving a brutal final-round collapse. David Mullin captured his fifth Green Jacket by 4 strokes, reclaiming the gross lead in Round 4 after a devastating blow-up had cost him the lead the day before. Williams dominated Stableford from his record-breaking 48-point opener through 69 of 72 holes, yet finished fifth in the Jacket at +128—43 strokes behind Mullin's +85.

Baker's championship dreams imploded on the par-4 9th in Round 4. After holding the Jacket lead for 16 holes, his catastrophic 10 (+6) ended both title bids. Mullin had lost the Jacket lead in Round 3 with a 9 (+4) on the 18th, then seized it back when Baker faltered. Henry Meller earned his second Wooden Spoon with 123 points despite carding the tournament's best round (R2: 41 points).

The tournament recorded 69 triple-bogeys or worse across 72 holes—nearly one blow-up per hole played. Williams endured a 21-stroke round range, from his opening 20 to a closing 41, yet his early brilliance proved enough to outlast the carnage at PGA Catalunya and Costa Brava.
