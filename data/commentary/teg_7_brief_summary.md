# TEG 7: Meller's Maiden

**Lisbon Coast, Portugal, 2014.** Four courses, two champions: Henry Meller claimed his first Trophy with a wire-to-wire 175-point performance across Praia D'El Rey, Bom Sucesso, and Royal Óbidos, while David Mullin seized his fifth Green Jacket with a 15-stroke victory. Meller led all 72 holes for Stableford but couldn't quite seal the Gross title, with Mullin pulling clear in Round 4 (+10, 45 points) to win at +53.

The Trophy battle never materialized—Meller's dominance extended from opening hole to last, winning by five points over Mullin and Gregg Williams (tied 170). Stuart Neumann's quiet excellence earned fourth (169 points) and runner-up in the Jacket (+68), punctuated by five birdies including two in the final round. Jon Baker's title defence collapsed spectacularly: an 11/+6 car-crash on the par-5 10th in Round 4 torpedoed him from second to fifth.

Alex Baker's week summed up in one horrific stretch: six blow-ups of eight-or-more across the opening 36 holes, sealing the Wooden Spoon at 152 points—23 behind fifth place. Meller's redemption arc complete: two consecutive Wooden Spoons (TEG 5-6) erased by a maiden Trophy triumph, never trailing once.
