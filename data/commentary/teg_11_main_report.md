## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker claimed his first Green Jacket with a commanding performance that saw him lead for seventy of the seventy-two holes in the gross competition. He also secured his third TEG Trophy, though that victory required a dramatic final-round rescue after his brother Alex staged a brief mutiny. The Stadium Course at PGA Catalunya, Spain's premier championship layout, provided a world-class backdrop for the family drama.

Alex Baker held a two-point Trophy lead entering Sunday but posted a career-worst twenty-seven points to hand Jon a six-point margin. The collapse ended Alex's hopes of splitting the competitions. Gregg Williams finished third in the Trophy race on one hundred and thirty-six points. David Mullin collected the Wooden Spoon despite finishing runner-up in the Jacket by just three strokes, a cruel twist that defined the tournament's paradoxes.

## Round 1: Early Chaos, Late Order {.round1 .round}

The Stadium Course at PGA Catalunya welcomed the field back after a five-year gap. Multiple lead changes punctuated the opening eighteen. John Patterson held the Trophy lead three times before imploding. Jon Baker seized control from the third hole onwards in the Jacket and never truly relinquished it.

Patterson's round encapsulated volatility. He opened with a par for four points at the first. By the fourth he had posted a nine. A quintuple bogey. That was merely the opening act. He added quintuples at the thirteenth and another blow-up at the tenth, racking up eight triples or worse. Six holes yielded no points. He finished on twenty-six points, yet somehow remained in fifth place.

Baker navigated the chaos with thirty-five points and a gross score of eighteen over. His brother Alex collected thirty-two points despite back-nine carnage that included an eight at the eleventh and another at the thirteenth. Gregg Williams endured quintuples at the second and fifth but recovered with a birdie at the fifteenth to claim thirty points. Dean McEntee briefly led both competitions at the sixth before fading.

Jon Baker led by three points in the Trophy and two strokes in the Jacket. The foundations were laid.

## Round 2: Course Record, Career Best {.round2 .round}

The Tour Course at PGA Catalunya offered a marginally gentler proposition. Jon Baker responded with an eighty-four, equalling the venue's TEG record. His forty-one-point haul extended his Trophy lead to two. Alex posted a career-best forty-two points, though his ninety-two gross kept him eleven strokes adrift in the Jacket chase. The gap was widening.

Baker's round featured birdies at the second and solid par golf through the middle stretch. David Mullin matched the birdie at the second and added another at the tenth. Mullin's gross score of eighty-five kept him within touching distance in the Jacket standings. He would not stay there.

Gregg Williams collected thirty-nine points with strong back-nine scoring, including a five-point birdie at the seventeenth to offset a blow-up at the fifteenth. Patterson managed thirty-four points despite an eleven at the fifteenth and a catalogue of other misadventures. He was accumulating triple bogeys like loyalty points.

Baker's dominance in both competitions appeared unassailable. Forty-one points. Eighty-four strokes. The Jacket was his to lose.

## Round 3: Brother Trouble at El Prat {.round3 .round}

El Prat's Azul Course, a Greg Norman design, introduced fresh variables. Alex Baker took the Trophy lead at the opening hole. Jon immediately surrendered it with a blow-up at the second. The lead changed hands again at the thirteenth when Jon posted a seven and Alex collected three points with a par. Alex led by two entering Sunday.

Jon's struggles concentrated between the twelfth and fifteenth, where he managed just five points across four holes. A cold spell. Triples at the twelfth and thirteenth, another at the fifteenth. He had led the Jacket for all but three holes across two rounds. Now he was vulnerable.

David Mullin briefly held the Jacket lead at the third before a quadruple bogey at the sixth ended his ambitions. He posted twenty-nine points to Jon's thirty-two, staying within three strokes overall. Patterson produced the round of the day with thirty-nine points despite yet another quintuple at the sixteenth. Gregg Williams contributed thirty-five points with another strong back nine.

Alex led the Trophy by two. Jon clung to a slender Jacket advantage. Sunday would settle everything.

## Round 4: Collapse and Coronation {.round4 .round}

Jon Baker retook the Trophy lead at the sixth hole when Alex posted a seven. The final round had become a procession. Alex would register twenty-seven points across eighteen holes, a personal nadir that transformed a two-point deficit into a six-point victory margin for Jon.

Alex's meltdown began early. A seven at the sixth yielded nothing. An eight at the ninth compounded the damage. He managed just five points between the fourth and ninth holes. The back nine offered no respite: eight at the twelfth, eight at the seventeenth. Blow-ups on four holes. His career-best forty-two points from Round Two felt like ancient history.

Jon Baker posted thirty-five points and a gross score of nineteen over to secure both titles. David Mullin briefly led the Jacket at the third with three consecutive pars but faded to finish three strokes back. Runner-up in the Jacket. Wooden Spoon winner nonetheless. The cruel arithmetic of TEG.

Patterson added thirty-six points with a par for four at the seventeenth, navigating his chaos towards respectability. Williams collected thirty-two points to claim third in the Trophy race. Jon Baker had led for fifty-nine of seventy-two holes in the Trophy and seventy of seventy-two in the Jacket.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's sweep of both competitions ended years of near-misses in the Jacket chase. He had won two Trophies before but never converted gross dominance into the green prize. This time the numbers aligned. Seventy holes in front. An eighty-four to equal the Tour Course record. Enough resilience on Sunday to withstand Alex's brief insurrection.

Alex Baker's collapse defined the narrative as much as Jon's victory. Forty-two points to twenty-seven across two rounds. Leading by two entering Sunday, then six adrift at the finish. The fifteen-point swing represented the widest margin in the final standings and the cruellest reversal of fortune.

Gregg Williams claimed third with one hundred and thirty-six points, never threatening the leaders but providing steady competition throughout. John Patterson's volatility produced twenty-one triple bogeys or worse, including two quintuples, yet he somehow climbed to fourth with a thirty-nine-point third round.

David Mullin's tournament remains the paradox for the ages. Runner-up in the Jacket by three strokes. Wooden Spoon recipient. The scoring format's most jarring contradiction, delivered on Spain's finest fairways with the Mediterranean sun as witness.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon Baker (1st):** Three Trophies now, but the first Jacket completes the set. Led the Jacket for seventy of seventy-two holes and the Trophy for fifty-nine, weathering Alex's third-round surge before cruising home. His eighty-four in Round Two equalled the PGA Catalunya Tour Course record.

**Alex Baker (2nd):** Held the Trophy lead entering Sunday but posted a career-worst twenty-seven points to finish six back. His forty-two points in Round Two marked a personal best, making the final-round capitulation all the more stark. Two blow-ups on the front nine set the tone; two more on the back confirmed the outcome.

**Gregg Williams (3rd):** Steady throughout with one hundred and thirty-six points, never leading but never fading. Posted back-nine surges in Rounds Two and Three, including five-point birdies at crucial moments. Finished third in the Trophy and fourth in the Jacket.

**John Patterson (4th):** Twenty-one triple bogeys or worse across four rounds, including two quintuples. Somehow posted a thirty-nine-point third round to climb from fifth to fourth. Six zero-point holes in Round One alone. Pure chaos, occasionally redirected towards competence.

**David Mullin (5th - Wooden Spoon):** Finished three strokes behind Jon in the Jacket but collected the Spoon regardless. Led the Jacket three times, briefly on Sunday with three consecutive pars. One hundred and twenty-five Trophy points left him adrift in the combined standings despite strong gross play.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Jon Baker's eighty-four in Round Two equalled the PGA Catalunya Tour Course record, matching scores posted by himself and Gregg Williams in TEG Twelve and David Mullin in the same event. Alex Baker's career range across a single tournament stretched from forty-two points to twenty-seven, the widest documented swing in TEG history. John Patterson's twenty-one triple bogeys or worse represented the highest concentration of blow-ups across a four-round event, yet he finished fourth. David Mullin's Jacket runner-up finish marked only the second time a Spoon winner had claimed second in gross scoring, a statistical quirk that underscores Stableford's peculiar justice.
