# TEG 11: Baker's Sweep as Brother's Dream Crumbles {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">Catalonia, Spain • 2018</p>

Jon Baker claimed his third Trophy and first Green Jacket with a wire-to-wire display of dominance across Catalonia's championship courses. Leading for 70 of 72 holes in the Gross competition and 59 in Stableford, Baker swept both competitions for the first time in his career. His six-point margin in the Trophy and three-stroke advantage in the Jacket understated the control he exerted throughout.

Alex Baker provided the weekend's drama. Two points clear entering Sunday after Round 3's best form, his tournament imploded with a career-worst 27 points in the final round. The 15-point swing between his Friday peak (42 points) and Sunday collapse defined a tournament that threatened to split the competitions but ultimately crowned a single champion.

David Mullin's Wooden Spoon at +73 came despite finishing runner-up in the Jacket by just three strokes, having briefly led the Gross competition three times. John Patterson's volatility added texture—21 triple-bogeys-or-worse across the week, yet still managing 39 points in Round 3 to climb from fifth to fourth.

## Round 1: Early Command {.round-1}

PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course set the tone. Jon Baker seized both leads by the third hole and never truly relinquished control. His 35 points and +18 gross opened a three-point Trophy gap and two-stroke Jacket advantage.

The round lurched through multiple lead changes in the opening holes. John Patterson grabbed the Trophy lead at the first with four points, lost it at the fourth with a quintuple-bogey nine, reclaimed it at the seventh, then bled away any remaining challenge. His back nine produced just nine points, including blow-ups at the tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth. The carnage left him eight triple-bogeys deep by day's end, with six zero-point holes and 26 points total.

Gregg Williams opened with a triple-bogey seven and hit bottom in the Spoon race after the first hole. A quintuple-bogey eight at the fifth confirmed his struggles. He recovered briefly through the middle holes—a birdie at the fifteenth offered hope—before blow-ups at the sixteenth cost him further ground. His 30 points left him fourth in the Trophy standings.

Alex Baker sat second with 32 points despite triple-bogeys at the second, eleventh and thirteenth. Dean McEntee flirted with the Jacket lead at the sixth before imploding at the seventh. Baker closed 18 holes three points behind his brother, with David Mullin fifth and Patterson struggling at +40 gross.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 35 | AB 32 | GW 30 | DM 29 | JP 26  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +18 | DM +20 | AB +28 | GW +29 | JP +40

## Round 2: Course Record Clarity {.round-2}

Jon Baker equalled the Tour Course record with 84 strokes, 12 over par, extending both leads. His 41 points opened a two-point Trophy gap, whilst 11 strokes clear in the Jacket left little doubt about the Gross competition's direction.

Alex Baker posted the tournament's finest Stableford round with 42 points, closing within striking distance. His four points at the third showcased his form before a quintuple-bogey nine at the twelfth briefly threatened to derail momentum. He recovered to finish second in the round, 77 points total placing him two behind his brother.

David Mullin birdied the second and tenth, moving into second place in the Jacket at +31 gross, 13 strokes behind Baker. Gregg Williams finished strongly—17 points on the front nine became 22 on the back, including a birdie at the seventeenth. His 39 points lifted him to third in both competitions.

Patterson endured another torrid afternoon. Blow-ups at the fifth and fifteenth, including an 11 at the latter, produced 34 points and +31 gross. He sat fifth in both standings, 24 points behind Baker in the Trophy race.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 76 | AB 74 | GW 69 | DM 65 | JP 60  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +30 | DM +31 | AB +48 | GW +49 | JP +71

## Round 3: The El Prat Shift {.round-3}

El Prat's Azul Course witnessed the tournament's pivotal moments. Alex Baker snatched the Trophy lead at the thirteenth, two points clear after Jon Baker's cold spell through holes twelve to fifteen cost him seven points.

The lead changed hands twice in the opening holes. Alex Baker took control at the first with three points, lost it immediately with a blow-up at the second, then reclaimed it at the thirteenth when his level-par four contrasted with his brother's triple-bogey seven. David Mullin briefly led the Jacket at the third hole before his own implosion—a quadruple-bogey seven at the sixth.

Jon Baker's birdie at the ninth had looked like establishing dominance. Instead, blow-ups at the twelfth, thirteenth and fifteenth allowed Alex to edge ahead 110 points to 108. Baker maintained the Jacket lead despite his stumble, +51 gross keeping him six strokes clear of Mullin's +52.

Patterson produced his finest round of the week with 39 points, climbing from fifth to fourth in the Trophy standings. Gregg Williams' back-nine surge—20 points after just 15 on the front—kept him third overall. Alex Baker's triple-bogey eight at the eighteenth narrowed his advantage slightly but left him holding a two-point lead heading to Sunday's finale at the Stadium Course.

**Trophy Standings:** AB 110 | JB 108 | GW 104 | JP 99 | DM 94  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +51 | DM +52 | AB +72 | GW +72 | JP +96

## Round 4: The Collapse {.round-4}

Alex Baker's tournament disintegrated at the sixth hole. Leading by two points, his triple-bogey seven handed control back to his brother. Jon Baker never looked back.

David Mullin grabbed the Jacket lead briefly at the third with three consecutive pars, only to lose it immediately when Baker matched him through the fourth. From there, the elder Baker extended his advantage methodically—20 points on the front nine, 15 on the back, finishing with 35 points and +19 gross.

Alex Baker's final round became a horror show. Zero points at the sixth marked the beginning. A quadruple-bogey eight at the ninth, another triple-bogey eight at the twelfth, then a quadruple-bogey eight at the seventeenth completed the carnage. His 27 points represented his worst Stableford round across 20 career rounds, averaging close to three-over per hole on his cold spells through holes four to nine and twelve to seventeen.

Patterson salvaged pride with 36 points, matching Gregg Williams' gross score despite the Welshman's 32 points. Williams' quintuple-bogey nine at the tenth cost him ground, whilst Mullin's 31 points left him competing only for the Wooden Spoon in Stableford terms whilst finishing runner-up in the Jacket.

Baker completed the sweep: 143 points and +70 gross, six points clear in the Trophy, three strokes ahead in the Jacket. His dominance across both competitions, leading 70 of 72 holes in Gross, confirmed his most commanding TEG performance.

**Final Trophy Standings:** JB 143 | AB 137 | GW 136 | JP 135 | DM 125  
**Final Green Jacket Standings:** JB +70 | DM +73 | AB +106 | GW +99 | JP +123

## Tournament Recap {.recap}

Jon Baker's third Trophy arrived with his first Green Jacket attached. Wire-to-wire dominance in the Gross competition, leading 70 of 72 holes, translated into a three-stroke margin over David Mullin. The Stableford battle proved tighter—a six-point advantage over Alex Baker understating how comprehensively control shifted when it mattered.

Alex Baker's collapse defined Sunday. Career-best 42 points on Friday, career-worst 27 on Sunday. The 15-point swing between rounds encapsulated a tournament that threatened to split the competitions before Jon Baker's class ensured both titles landed together. His brother led for 13 holes across the week but couldn't sustain the challenge when the Stadium Course demanded composure.

David Mullin's Wooden Spoon sits uncomfortably beside his runner-up Jacket finish. Just three strokes behind Baker in Gross, he led the competition three times yet finished 18 points adrift in Stableford. His 125 points placed him fifth in the Trophy, evidence of the format's cruel capacity to reward consistency over raw stroke play.

John Patterson's 21 triple-bogeys-or-worse—including two quintuple-bogeys—produced the tournament's wildest ride. His 39-point Round 3 surge showcased the potential lurking between disasters. Gregg Williams never led either competition, his 136 points securing third place in the Trophy whilst his blow-ups at key moments prevented any genuine challenge.

Baker's course-record-equalling 84 at the Tour Course in Round 2 established control he never relinquished. Spain's premier golf courses witnessed a performance built on relentless accuracy rather than spectacular brilliance. The sweep of both competitions, achieved with authority rather than fortune, confirmed his place among the tournament's elite performers.

## Player-by-Player Summary {.player-summary}

**Jon Baker (1st Trophy, 1st Green Jacket):** Swept both competitions with wire-to-wire dominance in Gross, leading 70 of 72 holes and 59 of 72 in Stableford. Equalled the Tour Course record with 84 in Round 2, maintained composure when Alex challenged in Round 3, then sealed victory with 35-point finale. Third Trophy, first Jacket—his most complete TEG performance.

**Alex Baker (2nd Trophy):** Led by two points entering Sunday before career-worst 27-point collapse. Friday's 42 points represented his best Stableford round, setting up weekend challenge before Sunday's implosion at holes six, nine, twelve and seventeen. The 15-point swing between best and worst rounds told the story—led for 13 holes across the week but couldn't sustain it.

**Gregg Williams (3rd Trophy):** Consistent without ever threatening the lead. Never held top spot in either competition despite 136 points total. Strong back-nine finishes in Rounds 2 and 3 kept him in contention. Early blow-ups and key collapses—quintuple-bogey at tenth in Round 4—prevented any serious challenge.

**John Patterson (4th Trophy):** Tournament of extremes. Twenty-one triple-bogeys-or-worse including two quintuple-bogeys, yet still posted 39 points in Round 3 to climb from fifth to fourth. Six zero-point holes in Round 1 alone set the tone for volatility that defined his week.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 2nd Green Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** The format's cruelest victim. Runner-up in Gross by just three strokes, briefly leading three times, yet collected the Wooden Spoon after finishing 18 points behind Baker in Stableford. His +73 gross secured fifth place in the Trophy—evidence that consistency trumps stroke play in this format.
