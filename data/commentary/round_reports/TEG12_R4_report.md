# TEG 12 - Round 4 Report

# PATTERSON CRUISES HOME AS THREE SHARE FINAL-ROUND HONOURS
**PGA Catalunya - Stadium • 06/10/2019 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

John Patterson needed only to avoid disaster in Sunday's final round at PGA Catalunya, and the overnight leader delivered exactly that—a steady 40 points that matched the day's best performances and sealed a commanding 10-point TEG Trophy victory. In a rare three-way tie for round honours, Patterson shared top billing with Alex Baker and Stuart Neumann, both of whom produced spectacular golf that proved too little, too late to threaten the leader's stranglehold on the title.

The final round unfolded without the dramatic swings that characterised earlier days, with Patterson's wire-to-wire dominance never seriously challenged despite some eye-catching performances behind him. Baker's tournament-best display propelled him from sixth to fifth, whilst Neumann's eagle at the par-5 15th provided the round's signature moment. The only real position battle saw Baker overtake David Mullin, whose sluggish start proved costly despite a strong recovery.

### How It Unfolded

Patterson stamped his authority on the Trophy from the opening tee, firing 16 points through the first six holes to immediately snuff out any lingering hopes of a final-day collapse. Whilst Alex Baker matched that blistering pace to signal his intent, the gap proved insurmountable—Patterson's three-round cushion had effectively decided this championship before Sunday's opening drives.

The middle stretch belonged to Gregg Williams, who carded the day's best six-hole run with 16 points from the seventh through twelfth. It represented Williams' last chance to apply meaningful pressure, but Patterson's steady 10-point response through that same stretch kept him comfortably clear. Behind them, Baker maintained his momentum with 13 points, whilst Mullin finally found his rhythm after a horror start that had yielded just seven points through six holes—the only player to fail to reach double figures in the opening stretch.

The par-4 ninth proved the round's graveyard, playing two strokes over par on average and yielding a meagre 1.67 points per player. It was there that several challenges flickered and died.

Neumann saved his best for last, closing with a spectacular 16-point salvo over the final six holes. His eagle at the par-5 15th—the round's easiest hole—earned five points and provided the day's most memorable strike. Patterson responded with 14 points of his own through the closing stretch, a performance that lacked drama but oozed control. Mullin also rallied with 14 points to close, but his early stumble had already condemned him to slip from fifth to sixth. All six competitors scored at least 19 points on the back nine, but the tournament had long since been decided.
