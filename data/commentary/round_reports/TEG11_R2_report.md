# TEG 11 - Round 2 Report

## Brothers in Arms: Jon Baker Holds Nerve as Alex Wins Round Two
**PGA Catalunya - Tour • 05/10/2018 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

With the halfway point looming, Jon Baker arrived at PGA Catalunya protecting a slender three-point advantage over younger brother Alex. What unfolded was a fascinating duel between siblings, with Alex claiming the round honours with a tournament-best 42 points, but Jon doing just enough to maintain his tournament lead—albeit by the narrowest of margins.

Alex's spectacular 10-point improvement from his opening round seemed destined to propel him past his brother, particularly after a blistering 16-point finish over the closing six holes. Yet Jon's composed front nine—matching Alex's 13 points through the opening stretch—proved crucial. When the dust settled, Jon clung to top spot by just two points, setting up a compelling second-half showdown.

Behind them, David Mullin produced the round's most spectacular split with 17 points through the middle six, whilst Gregg Williams' strong back nine kept him in touch in third. Remarkably, despite all the scoring movements, every player finished Round 2 in exactly the same position they'd started it.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes set the tone for a day of trading blows. Both Bakers posted identical 13-point splits, prowling around each other like prizefighters respecting their opponent's power. Gregg Williams matched them stride for stride, whilst David Mullin's sluggish nine-point start hinted at trouble ahead.

Then came the middle stretch, and with it, Mullin's moment of glory. The par-5 9th launched a remarkable surge that netted 17 points across six holes—the best split of the entire round by any player. For a brief spell, Mullin looked capable of launching a genuine challenge. But Jon Baker wasn't about to let his lead evaporate, responding with his own 16-point salvo through the same stretch to keep the Mullin charge at bay.

The drama shifted to the closing run, where Alex finally seized control. His 16-point finish—featuring stellar play from the 13th onwards—gave him the round victory and cut his brother's lead to its minimum. Jon's 12-point response showed remarkable composure under familial pressure, doing precisely what he needed: not winning the segment, but not losing the tournament either.

The par-5 15th emerged as the day's villain, averaging a brutal 7.8 strokes and yielding precious few points to anyone. Williams matched Alex's closing surge with 15 points of his own over the final six, his 22-point back nine keeping him within striking distance. John Patterson, meanwhile, endured a nine-point collapse over the closing stretch that left him marooned in fifth, 16 points adrift of the lead.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Jon Baker's two-point cushion offers virtually no margin for error. Average his first two rounds (38 points per round) and he'd finish on 152 points—but Alex, riding a 42-point hot streak, could hit 158 if he maintains this form. The leader needs 39-40 points per round to feel secure; anything less opens the door.

Alex sits perfectly positioned, needing to average just 39 points over the final two rounds to catch Jon at 152. One explosive round—another 42-pointer—could flip this championship entirely. The psychological edge of being the Round 2 winner cannot be underestimated.

Gregg Williams lurks seven points back in third, requiring a heroic 43-point average just to reach 155 and pressure the leaders. It's mathematically possible but would demand his two best rounds of the season. David Mullin (11 back) and John Patterson (16 adrift) face increasingly long odds, though Mullin's 17-point middle-six surge proved he's capable of fireworks when the mood strikes.

In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's consistency gives him a two-shot cushion over Jon, with four players still bunched within 10 strokes. That competition remains wide open.

### Round Highlights

- Alex Baker's 16-point closing surge—the tournament's best finishing six—wins him Round 2 but leaves him agonisingly short of the lead
- David Mullin's spectacular 17-point middle stretch, the best six-hole split of the day
- Jon Baker's nerveless 41 points under pressure from his brother, protecting his lead with minimal fuss
- The par-5 15th emerges as Round 2's monster, averaging 7.8 strokes and destroying scorecards
- A leaderboard that refused to budge—all five players finishing in identical positions to where they started
