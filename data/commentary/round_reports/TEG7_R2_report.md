# TEG 7 - Round 2 Report

## MELLER SURGES CLEAR AS BOM SUCESSO BARES ITS TEETH
**Bom Sucesso • 03/10/2014 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Henry MELLER seized control of TEG Trophy 7 with a commanding 51-point performance that stretched his lead to 10 points heading into the weekend. The defending champion's dominance came on a day when Bom Sucesso's brutish 15th hole—averaging a shocking +2.17 over par—separated the contenders from the pretenders.

While MELLER extended his advantage, the battle for the podium intensified behind him. Stuart NEUMANN surged from fifth to third with a brilliant 49-point effort, leapfrogging David MULLIN and the round's biggest casualty, Gregg WILLIAMS, who plummeted from third to fifth after a disastrous 38-point collapse. Jon BAKER held second but saw his deficit double, while in the Green Jacket race, MULLIN's improved gross performance kept him firmly in command despite his Stableford struggles.

The leader now stands 10 points clear with 36 holes remaining, but this tournament is far from over. With multiple players capable of big rounds and Bom Sucesso proving it can humble anyone, the weekend promises fireworks.

### How It Unfolded

The opening salvos suggested this would be a day of fireworks. Stuart NEUMANN roared out of the gates with 18 points through six holes, matching pace with Jon BAKER and David MULLIN as they all threatened MELLER's overnight lead. The champion responded with a solid 16 points to stay in touch, but at the par-4 2nd, BAKER briefly snatched the lead. MELLER's answer came swiftly—by the 3rd hole, he'd reclaimed top spot and would never relinquish it.

The defining stretch came through the middle section, holes 7 through 12. While Bom Sucesso's easiest hole, the par-5 4th, had offered early birdie chances, the course began to show its claws. At the 7th, six players registered significant scores in a hole that became the round's first flashpoint. MELLER responded with ruthless efficiency, piling up 20 points across this crucial stretch while WILLIAMS began to unravel with just 12 points. NEUMANN matched MELLER's intensity with 18 points of his own, quietly climbing the leaderboard as others faltered.

The closing holes delivered the drama this tournament demanded. The par-4 15th—already the course's hardest hole—became a graveyard. Averaging 1.83 Stableford points, it claimed victim after victim, with WILLIAMS' slide from third to fifth crystallizing here among seven scoring disasters. BAKER limped home with just 11 points over the final six, watching his challenge fade. But MELLER, showing the form that's made him dangerous, closed with 15 points to turn a comfortable lead into a commanding one. The par-5 17th provided late theatrics with five significant scores, but by then the damage was done—MELLER stood 10 points clear, with BAKER clinging to second and NEUMANN emerging as the dark horse.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

MELLER's 10-point cushion is substantial but far from insurmountable over 36 holes. History shows 50-point rounds are achievable on this course—MELLER just produced 51, NEUMANN hit 49. If the leader maintains his 50-point average, he'll finish on 200 points. BAKER needs to average 55 points per round to catch him—a tall order but not impossible if MELLER falters. The more realistic threat comes from NEUMANN, who needs 56 points across two rounds to overtake MELLER, but only 51 per round to catch BAKER for second.

The third-through-fifth positions are separated by just seven points, creating a fierce battle for the podium. MULLIN sits 14 back but has shown he can go low—his 27 points on the front nine today proves the capability is there. WILLIAMS needs to rediscover his Round 1 form quickly; 19 points behind, he needs two monster rounds of 46+ points while hoping others stumble.

The Spoon battle has intensified with Alex BAKER now 22 points behind the leader but showing improvement (42 points today versus 36 in Round 1). Meanwhile, MULLIN has built a commanding 14-shot lead in the Green Jacket gross competition, though BAKER's +15 handicap means he's still mathematically threatening if he can string together two clean rounds.

### Round Highlights

- MELLER's imperious 20-point middle stretch (holes 7-12) broke the field's back
- The par-4 15th averaging +2.17 over par—carnage that claimed seven victims
- Lead changes at holes 2 and 3 as BAKER briefly threatened before MELLER responded
- NEUMANN's wire-to-wire consistency: 18-18-13 points across the three sections
- MULLIN's brilliant 27-point front nine undone by a 19-point back nine fade
