## Round Report

# BAKER SURVIVES WILD OPENING AS ÓBIDOS CLAIMS CASUALTIES
**Royal Óbidos • September 30, 2016 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The ninth TEG Trophy burst into life at Royal Óbidos with a chaotic opening round that produced four lead changes in the first six holes before Jon BAKER finally seized control. His 39-point performance—matching a steady gross 17—gave him the narrowest of advantages heading into Saturday's second round, with David MULLIN and John PATTERSON tied just one point behind after their own impressive displays.

BAKER's victory came through consistency rather than fireworks, posting balanced splits of 13-14-12 points across the three six-hole sections. But the real drama unfolded behind him, where MULLIN produced a blistering 21-point back nine to close within a whisker of the lead, while Stuart NEUMANN suffered a catastrophic collapse that saw him plummet from joint-leader after nine holes to last place by stumps.

With three rounds still to play and the entire field separated by just 16 points, this tournament remains wide open—though NEUMANN's 17-6 split suggests Royal Óbidos has already claimed its first victim.

### How It Unfolded

The opening holes set the tone for a day of constant upheaval. John PATTERSON struck first blood with an early lead, but by the par-3 second, Jon BAKER had seized control with five points already on his card. It lasted barely a hole—David MULLIN surged ahead at the third to reach seven points and claim the lead for himself.

Then came the par-4 fourth, a hole that would define the day's difficulties. Playing an average of 3.5 strokes over par, it was a graveyard that claimed victims across the field and averaged just 0.83 Stableford points per player. The carnage reshuffled the pack, allowing PATTERSON to reclaim the lead at the fifth with 11 points. But BAKER wasn't done—the defending champion answered immediately at the sixth to take the lead for what would prove to be the final time, reaching 13 points and establishing a position he would never relinquish.

The middle six holes became BAKER's platform. While PATTERSON matched him stride for stride with 13 points to stay in touch, BAKER posted 14 points to extend his cushion and reach the turn with genuine breathing room. Behind them, Stuart NEUMANN's promising start—12 points through the opening six—began to unravel spectacularly at the tenth, where a disaster hole dropped him three positions and started a back-nine meltdown that would see him manage just six points across the final twelve holes.

The closing stretch delivered high drama. MULLIN, who had posted steady 12-point splits through both opening sections, exploded into life with 14 points across the final six holes. His 21-point back nine was the round's most impressive spell, turning a solid round into a genuine title challenge. BAKER held firm with 12 points to protect his lead, while PATTERSON's matching 12 kept him in the hunt at joint-second. Alex BAKER produced the day's strongest finish—13 points in the final six—to rescue what had been a stuttering round and claim fourth place, seven points off the pace.

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining:**

The tournament is deliciously poised with the top three separated by just a single point. Jon BAKER's advantage is purely psychological—one poor hole in Saturday's second round could see him fall to third. MULLIN and PATTERSON are perfectly positioned, needing only to match the leader's scoring to create a genuine three-way battle heading into the weekend's final two rounds.

For BAKER to protect his lead, he'll need to average 35 points per round—a tall order given Royal Óbidos's difficulty. His challengers know that 36-point rounds would apply real pressure, while 38-point performances could build decisive advantages. Alex BAKER remains mathematically competitive seven points back, but needs big rounds of 38-plus points while hoping for slip-ups ahead. Gregg WILLIAMS sits eight points adrift and needs the leaders to falter while posting his own career rounds.

Stuart NEUMANN faces the grimmest mathematics—16 points behind after one round means he'd need to average 43 points per round while the leaders collapse completely. After today's back-nine horror show, his focus shifts to avoiding the Wooden Spoon rather than chasing silverware. The Green Jacket competition mirrors the Stableford standings, with BAKER's five-stroke advantage over MULLIN offering slightly more breathing room but still thoroughly catchable across 54 remaining holes.

### Round Highlights
- Four lead changes in the opening six holes set the tone for a chaotic day
- The par-4 fourth played as the hardest hole, averaging 3.5 strokes over par and claiming multiple victims
- David MULLIN's explosive 21-point back nine, including 14 points in the final six holes
- Stuart NEUMANN's catastrophic collapse: 17 points on the front nine, just six on the back
- Jon BAKER's consistency across all three splits (13-14-12) proved decisive in establishing the lead

### Player Summaries

**Jon BAKER:** His 39-point opening statement (20 front/19 back) built around steady six-hole splits of 13-14-12 gives him a one-point lead in both competitions. Seized control at the sixth hole and never relinquished it, though his advantage remains wafer-thin.

**David MULLIN:** Posted 38 points (17 front/21 back) with the day's most impressive finish—21 points on the back nine including 14 in the closing six. Tied for second, just one point behind, and his late surge suggests he's hitting form at exactly the right time.

**John PATTERSON:** Another 38-point performance (18 front/20 back) with the most consistent splits of anyone (13-13-12). Led briefly at the fifth hole but couldn't sustain it, now tied for second and perfectly positioned to strike.

**Alex BAKER:** Recovered from a sluggish start (9 points through six holes) to post 32 points (15 front/17 back), with the strongest finish of any player—13 points in the final six. Sits fourth, seven points off the lead but not out of it.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** His 31 points (16 front/15 back) included a solid middle section (12 points) before fading badly down the stretch with just eight points in the closing six. Fifth place, eight points behind the leader.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** The day's biggest disaster—23 points (17 front/6 back) tells the story of a promising start destroyed by a back-nine collapse. Posted just six points across the final twelve holes after reaching the turn in contention, now 16 points adrift in last place.
