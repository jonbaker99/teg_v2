# TEG 9 - Round 4 Report

# Patterson Survives Late Drama to Claim TEG Trophy
**Praia D'El Rey • 03/10/2016 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

John Patterson arrived at Praia D'El Rey with a five-point cushion and a simple mission: protect his lead. What unfolded instead was a gripping final-round duel that saw the Trophy change hands twice in the space of two holes before Patterson's explosive back nine sealed a six-point victory.

Patterson's tournament-best 47 points—13 better than his previous round—should have made it comfortable. It wasn't. Alex Baker's scorching middle six (19 points) kept him within striking distance, and when he briefly seized the lead at the 14th, the Trophy was genuinely in doubt. But Patterson's response was immediate and emphatic, reclaiming the lead one hole later and never looking back. His 25-point back nine proved the difference between triumph and heartbreak.

Behind the two-man battle, David Mullin's steady 38 points secured third place, while Jon Baker became the only player to lose ground in the final round, dropping from joint-third to fourth despite a respectable 36 points.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes hinted at the drama to come. Patterson posted a solid 14 points to maintain his advantage, but the brutal par-4 5th—the day's hardest hole—claimed victims across the field. With the average player carding a double-bogey, even staying level felt like a minor victory. Baker matched Patterson's 12-point start, keeping the gap manageable as they headed into the critical middle stretch.

**The Explosive Middle Six**

Holes 7 through 12 transformed the tournament. Baker unleashed the round's most devastating sequence, racking up 19 points in six holes to surge within touching distance. Patterson, seemingly caught in Baker's slipstream, responded with 17 points of his own—enough to keep his nose in front but not enough to shake his relentless pursuer. The Trophy that had seemed secure at sunrise was suddenly hanging by a thread.

**Drama at the Death**

The par-4 13th—statistically the easiest hole of the day—offered brief respite before the tension reached breaking point. At the 14th, Baker finally overhauled Patterson to take his first lead of the week. For one hole, the Trophy had a new owner. Patterson's response at the 15th was instant: he reclaimed the lead and this time, there would be no further changes.

The closing stretch became a procession as Patterson's magnificent back-nine total of 25 points—the difference between anxiety and authority—carried him home. Baker's challenge faded, his own 22 points on the back nine unable to match Patterson's relentless scoring. When the final putts dropped, Patterson had turned a five-point overnight lead into a six-point victory, his 168 total points crowning him TEG Trophy champion.

### What's At Stake

With no rounds remaining, the championships are decided. Patterson claims the TEG Trophy with his wire-to-wire victory, never relinquishing top spot despite Baker's valiant final-round surge. The six-point margin tells only half the story—Patterson's ability to respond instantly when Baker briefly seized the lead at the 14th proved the mark of a champion.

Baker's runner-up finish caps a tournament of frustration and brilliance in equal measure. His explosive middle-six sequence and that tantalizing one-hole lead will serve as both encouragement and torture during the off-season. Six points separated glory from heartbreak.

In the Green Jacket race, David Mullin's wire-to-wire dominance proved more straightforward. His final gross score of +60 left him nine strokes clear of Jon Baker, a margin that reflects his consistency across all four rounds. While the Trophy battle provided the drama, Mullin's steady accumulation of the lowest scores delivered silverware of its own.

The battle for third place in the Trophy standings sees Mullin edge Jon Baker and Gregg Williams by three points—the reward for sustained excellence rather than spectacular bursts.
