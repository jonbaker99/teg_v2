# TEG 8 - Round 2 Report

## Williams Extends Command as Penha Longa Bares Its Teeth

**Penha Longa • 26/11/2015 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams sent an ominous message to his challengers with a commanding 41-point performance that stretched his TEG Trophy lead to 11 points at the halfway mark. Coming into the round with a slender advantage, Williams dominated the opening six holes with 16 points and never looked back, posting the best round of the day while Penha Longa's notorious difficulty humbled the chasing pack.

Jon Baker held second place but lost crucial ground with 34 points, while Alex Baker and David Mullin both fired 36-point rounds to remain deadlocked in third. The round's drama came not from position changes—remarkably, all six players finished exactly where they started—but from Penha Longa's brutal examination, particularly at the catastrophic par-4 16th where the field averaged 7.5 strokes. Henry Meller's tournament challenge evaporated with a disastrous 27-point showing, collapsing to just 13 points over his final 12 holes.

With two rounds remaining, Williams has transformed what was a tight contest into a substantial advantage, though mathematical possibilities remain for those willing to mount a charge.

### How It Unfolded

**Dominant Start**

Williams announced his intentions immediately, racing through the opening six holes with 16 points to establish control. While Alex Baker, Henry Meller, and Stuart Neumann all posted respectable 14-point starts, Baker's 10-point struggle over the same stretch left him playing catch-up from the outset. The par-4 4th offered brief respite as the easiest hole of the day, averaging 4.17 strokes, but it proved a false dawn for what lay ahead.

**The Middle-Six Massacre**

If the front six belonged to Williams, the middle stretch belonged to Penha Longa's architects. Williams and Jon Baker both navigated the treacherous 7-through-12 stretch with 14 points, but carnage unfolded behind them. The par-5 12th proved particularly brutal, the field averaging 7.33 strokes and scraping just a single point each. Henry Meller managed only eight points through this minefield, while Stuart Neumann imploded with a devastating seven-point return that effectively ended any lingering ambitions.

**Brutal Finish**

Jon Baker mounted the round's only sustained challenge with a 10-point finish over the closing six, including a strong back-nine recovery that salvaged 18 points total after his poor start. But the par-4 16th—averaging 7.5 strokes and yielding just half a point per player—epitomized Penha Longa's defensive resistance. Williams coolly added 11 points down the stretch to secure his 41-point victory, while Meller's tournament hopes disintegrated entirely with a catastrophic five-point finish that left him 23 points adrift.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Williams has built a commanding 11-point cushion that would require him to implode while his challengers find career form. To protect his lead, he needs to average just 34 points per round—well below his 39.5-point average through two rounds. Even a modest 36-point average over the final two rounds would put him at 151 total, a target that would demand extraordinary performances from those behind.

Jon Baker, now 11 points back, needs to average 40 points per round while hoping Williams stumbles to 34 or below. That's a tall order given Baker has yet to crack 35 points in either round. The mathematics are even more daunting for the third-place duo of Alex Baker and David Mullin, sitting 13 points adrift. They would need to average 41 points per round—seven better than their current pace—combined with a complete Williams collapse to have any realistic chance.

The battle for respectability may prove more compelling than the championship chase. Henry Meller sits 23 points behind Williams but only eight ahead of Stuart Neumann in the fight to avoid the Wooden Spoon, a gap that remains eminently catchable over 36 holes. For Meller, the final two rounds represent damage control; for Neumann, they offer a lifeline.

### Round Highlights

- Williams' dominant 16-point opening six established complete control
- The par-5 12th carnage, averaging 7.33 strokes and yielding just one point per player
- Par-4 16th brutality—7.5 stroke average made it the hardest hole of the championship so far
- Baker's resilient back-nine recovery (18 points) after his 10-point opening disaster
- Meller's devastating collapse: just 13 points over his final 12 holes

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Commanding 41-point performance (up from 38 in R1) built on a brilliant 16-point start and maintained through consistent play across all three six-hole segments; extends lead to 11 points and firmly in control at halfway.

**Jon Baker:** Solid 34-point round matched his R1 total but lost crucial ground to Williams; after struggling to 10 points through the opening six, mounted an impressive back-nine recovery with 18 points to hold second place.

**Alex Baker:** Improved to 36 points (up from 30) with a front-nine-loaded performance (21 points through 12 holes) before fading to nine points over the closing stretch; remains tied for third, 13 points behind Williams.

**David Mullin:** Matched Alex Baker's 36 points (up from 30) with the day's most consistent six-hole splits (13-13-10), avoiding the dramatic swings that plagued others; shares third place but faces a significant 13-point deficit.

**Henry Meller:** Disastrous 27-point collapse (down from 29) ended any realistic championship hopes; after a promising 14-point start, managed just eight points from 7-12 and a catastrophic five-point finish demolished his position.

**Stuart Neumann:** Improved to 31 points (up from 17) with a strong 14-point opening, but a seven-point middle six undermined his progress; remains in last place, 31 points adrift but now within striking distance of Meller for the Spoon battle.
