## Round Report

## Lead Changes and Late Drama at Lingfield
**Lingfield Park • 30/08/2011 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Coming into the second round, Jon Baker held a four-point cushion at the top of the leaderboard, but his advantage was about to evaporate in spectacular fashion. In a round that delivered three lead changes and the day's most compelling individual performance, Henry Meller surged from fourth place with a brilliant 36-point display to share the lead with David Mullin at 64 points. Baker, who had controlled proceedings through the front nine and into the back, suffered a catastrophic collapse over the final six holes, scoring just seven points to tumble into third place, now a single point behind the co-leaders.

The drama unfolded in waves: Mullin's dominant front nine set up his challenge, the middle holes saw Baker and Mullin trade the lead three times, and Meller's relentless consistency—particularly a stunning 13-point burst in the second six—propelled him from the chasing pack into a share of top spot. With two rounds remaining and just four points separating first from fourth, this tournament has exploded into life.

### How It Unfolded

David Mullin announced his intentions immediately, posting 13 points across the opening six holes to close within striking distance of Baker. The par-3 1st, which would prove the joint-hardest hole of the day at 2.2 over par, set an early defensive tone. Meanwhile, Meller began steadily with 11 points, quietly positioning himself for what would become the day's most impressive surge.

The middle stretch delivered championship drama. At the 11th, Mullin seized the lead from Baker for the first time. Baker hit straight back at the 12th to reclaim top spot, but this back-and-forth battle was taking its toll. The critical moment came at the par-4 14th, where Mullin wrested the lead away again and Baker's round began to unravel—he would drop from first to third in a matter of holes.

But the real story was unfolding quietly behind them. Meller's second six holes produced an exceptional 13-point haul, the best split of the entire round, and his perfectly balanced 18-18 splits meant he was gaining ground with every hole. As Baker stumbled through the final stretch with just seven points, Meller closed with a superb 12 points in the last six to complete his climb from fourth to a share of the lead. Mullin, holding steady with 10 points down the stretch, joined him at the summit. Gregg Williams rallied late with 18 points on the back nine, but his slow start left him four points adrift in fourth, while Stuart Neumann's disastrous opening six holes—just six points—proved impossible to overcome despite a strong middle-round recovery.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** HM 36 | DM 33 | GW 31 | JB 28 | SN 28  
**Round 2 Gross:** HM +20 | DM +28 | GW +30 | JB +32 | SN +32

**Tournament Stableford:** DM 64 | HM 64 | JB 63 | GW 60 | SN 56  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +59 | HM +60 | JB +63 | GW +65 | SN +67

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

The tournament has compressed dramatically. Mullin and Meller share the lead at 64 points, but they cannot relax—Baker sits just one point back, and Williams is only four behind in fourth. In Stableford scoring, these gaps are eminently catchable: a strong round can make up four points, and a poor one can surrender the lead entirely.

The co-leaders need to average around 30-31 points per round to stay in control, which means maintaining the consistency that got them here. Baker needs to rediscover his Round 1 form (35 points) to challenge—if he can post back-to-back strong rounds while the leaders stumble, he's right back in it. Williams, despite being four back, knows that a 35-point round combined with modest performances from those ahead could vault him into contention. Even Neumann, eight points adrift, isn't mathematically eliminated, though he'd need the round of the tournament while others faltered.

The Green Jacket race remains tight too, with Mullin holding a one-stroke advantage over Meller. This is far from over—momentum has shifted twice already, and with 36 holes still to play, everything remains up for grabs.

### Round Highlights

- Henry Meller's stunning 13-point second six holes—the best split of the day
- Three lead changes between Baker and Mullin at holes 11, 12, and 14
- Jon Baker's seven-point collapse over the final six holes cost him the lead
- David Mullin's dominant 18-point front nine set up his challenge
- The par-3 1st and par-4 17th proved brutal, both playing 2.2 over par

### Player Summaries

**David MULLIN:** Posted 33 points to climb from second into a share of the lead, his front-nine dominance (18 points) and composure through three lead changes proving decisive. Leads the Green Jacket race by a single stroke.

**Henry MELLER:** The round's standout performer with 36 points, his perfectly balanced 18-18 split and exceptional second six (13 points) powered him from fourth to joint-first. Also just one behind in the gross competition.

**Jon BAKER:** A disastrous final six holes (7 points) saw him surrender the lead and drop to third, now one point back. His -7 point swing from Round 1 to Round 2 highlights how quickly fortunes can change.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Improved to 31 points but couldn't climb from fourth despite a strong back nine (18 points). His slow start (7 points in first six) proved costly, now four points off the pace.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Flat 28 points again, but his opening-six horror show (6 points) left him too much ground to make up. Despite a solid middle stretch (12 points), he's now eight points behind the leaders.
