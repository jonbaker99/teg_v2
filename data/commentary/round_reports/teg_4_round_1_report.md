## Round Report

## Baker Seizes Control in Chaotic Ashdown Opener
**Ashdown • 29/08/2011 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The fourth TEG Trophy burst into life at Ashdown with six lead changes in a wild opening round that saw Jon Baker emerge from the chaos to seize control. After a volatile front nine where all five players held a share of the lead at various points, Baker stormed home with a devastating 14 points in the final six holes to card 35 points and establish a four-point advantage.

David Mullin's consistent play earned him second place on 31 points, while early front-runner Gregg Williams slipped to third (29 points) after a back-nine collapse. The round exposed Ashdown's teeth early, with the par-3 11th playing to an average of 7.0 strokes—four over par—and claiming multiple victims in a brutal middle stretch.

With three rounds remaining, Baker's commanding opening statement has set the tone, but the volatility of this round suggests nothing is settled yet. The TEG Trophy race is wide open, and in the secondary Green Jacket competition, every stroke counts as players look to establish early advantage in the gross scoring battle.

### How It Unfolded

**Six Leaders in Six Holes**

The opening stretch at Ashdown provided immediate drama as all five players found themselves deadlocked at 9 points after six holes—but not before the lead had changed hands six times. Baker stumbled early at the 2nd, dropping two positions, while Stuart Neumann grabbed the first lead at the 4th from Williams. The par-3 5th proved brutal, averaging 2.6 strokes over par and triggering multiple position swings as players struggled to find solid footing.

**Williams Takes Command**

As the field turned toward the middle six, Williams began to assert himself. By the 8th hole—mercifully the easiest on the course at just 0.4 over par—he had accumulated 17 points through eight holes and looked to be establishing control. His 19-point front nine was the day's best, built on aggressive play that had him leading the tournament with momentum on his side.

But Ashdown's notorious 11th, a seemingly innocent par-3, proved to be a graveyard. Playing to an average of 7.0 strokes, the hole devastated the field and set up a dramatic back-nine shootout. Baker, who had quietly accumulated 23 points through twelve holes, sensed his opportunity.

**The Final Six Surge**

The tournament exploded at the 16th when Baker finally seized the lead from Williams and immediately put his foot down. What followed was a masterclass in closing: 14 points in the final six holes, including crucial gains while his rivals faltered. Williams, whose front-nine dominance had looked so promising, managed just 10 points on the back nine—a collapse that cost him the lead. Mullin, steady throughout with 12 points in the closing stretch, kept himself within striking distance but couldn't match Baker's firepower. The difficult 14th and 18th—averaging 3.0 and 2.0 over par respectively—provided final tests that only Baker truly conquered.

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Baker's four-point cushion provides breathing room but hardly guarantees anything—not after a round that featured six lead changes and demonstrated just how quickly fortunes can shift at Ashdown. To maintain control, he needs to average approximately 29-30 points per round, matching today's field average while avoiding the kind of collapse that claimed Williams on the back nine.

For Mullin, the gap is eminently catchable. He needs to find an extra 1-2 points per round while hoping Baker regresses toward the mean—entirely plausible given the volatility we witnessed. Williams, sitting six back, requires approximately 31 points per round plus mistakes from Baker to mount a serious challenge. His front-nine brilliance (19 points) proves he has the firepower; he must now find consistency.

Henry Meller and Stuart Neumann, both seven points adrift, face steeper climbs but remain mathematically viable. Neumann's 11-point opening stretch shows he can go low, while Meller's steady 28 demonstrates he can avoid disasters. Each needs multiple 32+ point rounds while the leaders falter. In the Green Jacket race, Baker's four-stroke advantage sets the early pace, but with 54 holes remaining, everyone is still hunting for gross scoring perfection.

### Round Highlights

- **The 11th Hole Massacre:** Par-3 averaging 7.0 strokes (four over par) claimed multiple victims and reshaped the leaderboard
- **Six Changes in Six Holes:** Opening stretch saw all five players share the lead at various points in chaotic start
- **Baker's Closing Blitz:** 14 points in final six holes, including lead-seizing birdie at the 16th
- **Williams' Two-Faced Round:** Brilliant 19-point front nine followed by disastrous 10-point back nine collapse
- **The Great Equalizer:** All five players deadlocked at 9 points through six holes before chaos ensued
