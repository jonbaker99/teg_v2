# TEG 17 - Round 2 Report

## Mullin's Monster Round Shakes Up West Cliffs
**West Cliffs • 06/10/2024 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

The TEG Trophy race burst into life at West Cliffs as David Mullin fired a career-best 47 points to claim the round and storm into contention, just two points behind new leader Jon Baker. After opening with 33 points in Round 1, Mullin's 14-point improvement—fueled by a devastating 18-point middle six—vaulted him from tied third to second place overall.

Jon Baker seized the tournament lead with a composed 44 points, his steady consistency (18-12-14 across the splits) proving more valuable than fireworks. The 38-year-old extends his overnight second position to lead on 82 points, but Mullin's ominous form means Baker's cushion is paper-thin heading into the weekend.

The day's shock came from overnight leader John Patterson, whose catastrophic 22-point collapse—17 points worse than his opening 39—saw him plummet from first to fifth. Patterson now sits 21 points adrift with two rounds remaining, his title defense hanging by a thread. In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's round-winning 10 gross strengthens his position as the gross scoring specialist.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker set the early tempo, building an 18-point foundation through the opening six holes while Patterson's defense began to crumble with just 8 points. The par-4 third proved particularly vicious, averaging 6.4 strokes as the field struggled with its technical demands. By the sixth hole, the leaderboard was already reshaping—Alex Baker climbed two positions while Patterson dropped two, the first cracks appearing in what would become a comprehensive collapse.

**Mullin Takes Command**

The middle six holes belonged entirely to David Mullin. His 18-point blitz through holes 7-12 powered him up the leaderboard as competitors watched helplessly. Jon Baker maintained his steady 12 points through this stretch, refusing to chase and protecting his position with percentage golf. Patterson's nightmare deepened with just 5 points—his tournament hopes evaporating in real-time as the deficit ballooned.

The par-4 tenth created havoc across the field, averaging 5.4 strokes, but Mullin navigated the chaos while others foundered. Alex Baker matched Baker's 12-point middle stretch to keep himself in the conversation, though still trailing the leaders.

**Closing Drama at the Brutal 13th**

The closing six began with carnage at the par-5 13th—the round's hardest hole at 7.4 strokes average, a staggering 2.4 over par. The monster hole inflicted damage across the board, but Mullin absorbed the blow and responded with 15 points through the final six to seal his round victory. Jon Baker's 14-point finish was equally impressive, protecting his overnight gains to claim the lead.

Gregg Williams rallied with 14 points on the closing stretch, but his earlier steady play lacked the spark to challenge the front-runners. Patterson limped home with 9 points, completing his miserable day 21 points behind Baker. The par-4 18th provided late relief, averaging 2.8 Stableford points as players finished on a merciful high note.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:** Jon Baker's 2-point advantage is razor-thin, with David Mullin breathing down his neck after today's 47-point explosion. Baker needs to average 36 points per round to reach 154 total—a target Mullin can match by maintaining 37-point rounds. These two are locked in a private battle, with the momentum suddenly shifting toward Mullin.

Alex Baker (13 points back) and Gregg Williams (14 back) remain mathematically alive but need heroics—both require 40+ point rounds while hoping the leaders stumble. For perspective, that's 3-5 points better than their best performances so far. They're outsiders, but West Cliffs has form for chaos.

John Patterson's 21-point deficit looks insurmountable. He'd need back-to-back 47-point rounds (matching Mullin's career best) while Baker and Mullin both collapse—possible in theory, but his confidence must be shattered after today's 22-point horror show. The Spoon battle has become his more realistic focus.

The Green Jacket race tells a different story: Mullin's gross superiority (9 strokes clear of Baker) suggests he's building an unassailable lead in that competition, even if the Trophy slips away.

### Round Highlights
- David Mullin's 18-point rampage through the middle six holes demolishes the field
- Jon Baker's ice-cool 44 points seizes the lead without fanfare
- John Patterson's 17-point collapse from Round 1—from hero to zero in 18 holes
- The par-5 13th averaging 7.4 strokes—carnage on the toughest test
- Alex Baker's front-nine 23 points keeps him in distant mathematical contention

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Steady 44 points (18-12-14 splits) claims the tournament lead by 2 points. Never spectacular, always reliable—exactly what's needed halfway through. In the Green Jacket race, his +52 total trails Mullin by 9 strokes.

**David Mullin:** Career-best 47 points and round-winning 10 gross vaults him to second overall. His middle-six masterclass (18 points) was the round's defining spell. Just 2 points behind Baker with momentum surging—and leading the Jacket by 9 strokes.

**Alex Baker:** Improved to 37 points but the 5-point gain isn't enough. Strong front nine (23 points) faded to 14 on the back. Now third overall, 13 points behind with ground to make up.

**Gregg Williams:** Consistent 35 points matches his Round 1 form, but steady doesn't win tournaments. Dropped to fourth after being unable to capitalize on Patterson's collapse. Needs inspiration, not repetition.

**John Patterson:** Catastrophic 22 points—a 17-point nosedive from his opening 39. The overnight leader managed just 8-5-9 across the splits. From first to fifth, his title defense lies in ruins at 21 points behind.
