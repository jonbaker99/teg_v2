# TEG 17 - Round 1 Report

## Patterson Steals Round One From Baker's Grasp
**Praia D'El Rey • 05/10/2024 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The opening salvo of TEG Trophy 17 delivered immediate drama as John Patterson snatched victory from Jon Baker's seemingly unassailable position with a nerveless closing stretch at Praia D'El Rey. Baker's explosive start—15 Stableford points through six holes—had the field chasing shadows, but Patterson's relentless back nine proved decisive. The pivotal moment came at the par-4 16th, where Patterson seized the lead with just two holes remaining, then held his nerve through a chaotic finale at the 18th that saw seven scoring events and multiple position changes. Patterson's 39-point round edged Baker by a single point, with David Mullin's spectacular back-nine resurrection seeing him join Gregg Williams in a tie for third on 33 points.

In the secondary Green Jacket competition, Mullin's gross score performance gave him early advantage in the stroke-play battle, though the Stableford drama overshadowed the opening round's gross standings.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker announced his intentions immediately. By the time the field reached the seventh hole, Baker had posted 22 Stableford points—a blistering pace that left him six points clear of the field. His opening salvo of 15 points through the first six holes included taking the lead from Alex Baker at the par-4 third, and he appeared destined for a commanding first-round advantage.

But golf at Praia D'El Rey rarely follows the script. While Baker dominated the front nine, John Patterson was quietly assembling something special. The par-4 fifth—the day's hardest hole, averaging 2.8 strokes over par—became Patterson's launching pad, climbing two positions as others struggled. His steady 16 points through the opening nine kept him within striking distance, even as Baker seemed untouchable.

The middle six holes told a different story. Patterson accelerated with 16 points while Baker's momentum stalled at 12. The par-5 12th, playing as the day's easiest hole, saw the field make hay with an average of 2.8 points, but it was Patterson's consistency that began closing the gap. Meanwhile, David Mullin was mounting his own recovery mission—after managing just six points through the opening six holes, he suddenly found form with 12 points in the middle stretch.

The tournament turned at the par-4 16th. Patterson, riding the wave of his 23-point back nine, overtook Baker to claim the lead with two holes to play. Baker's closing six yielded just 11 points—a stark contrast to his opening fireworks. The par-4 18th brought pure chaos: seven separate scoring events saw Gregg Williams climb two positions and Alex Baker tumble two spots in the final-hole scramble. Through it all, Patterson held his nerve, his 14 points in the final six holes securing a one-point victory and the early lead in TEG Trophy 17.

**Tournament Gross:** DM +23 | JP +23 | AB +24 | GW +25 | JB +28

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Patterson's one-point cushion is wafer-thin—effectively nonexistent over 54 holes of play. The Stableford race is wide open: Baker needs merely to average 39 points per round to have a shot at overhauling the leader, while Patterson must maintain his opening-round form to protect his advantage. Even the players six back—Mullin and Williams on 33—remain very much in contention, requiring approximately 40 points per round to challenge for the trophy. A single strong round could reshuffle the entire leaderboard.

The Green Jacket gross competition presents even tighter margins. Mullin and Patterson share the early lead at +23, with Alex Baker just one stroke behind. Unlike Stableford's points system, where momentum shifts can be dramatic, the stroke-play format rewards sustained excellence. Baker's superior Stableford scoring suggests his round included some high-risk, high-reward play that didn't translate to gross efficiency.

At the bottom, no player is out of the hunt—seven points separates first from fifth in the Stableford standings, roughly two strong holes per round. This tournament is far from decided.

### Round Highlights
- Jon Baker's stunning opening six holes (15 points) establishing early dominance
- The par-4 5th playing brutally hard (average 2.8 over par) as Patterson gained ground
- David Mullin's remarkable recovery: 6 points through six holes, then 27 over the final twelve
- Patterson's clutch par-4 16th seizure of the lead with two to play
- The chaotic 18th hole featuring seven scoring events and multiple position swings

### Player Summaries

**John Patterson:** Steady brilliance over spectacular starts—his 23-point back nine and nerveless finish through 16-18 earned him the Round 1 victory and a one-point tournament lead.

**Jon Baker:** Explosive opening six holes (15 points) had him six clear by the seventh, but managed only 16 points over the final twelve as Patterson hunted him down; lies one back.

**David Mullin:** A tale of two nines—struggled to just 10 points on the front before erupting for 23 on the back, including 15 in the final six; his +23 gross shares the Green Jacket lead despite trailing by six in Stableford.

**Gregg Williams:** Consistent throughout with 15 on the front and 18 on the back, climbed two spots on the dramatic 18th to share third place, six points off the lead.

**Alex Baker:** Strong middle six (14 points) couldn't prevent a two-position slide on the final hole; trails by seven but well within striking distance with three rounds remaining.
