# TEG 7 - Round 1 Report

## Meller Seizes First-Round Lead After Six Lead Changes
**Praia D'El Rey • 02/10/2014 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The seventh TEG Trophy burst into life at Praia D'El Rey with a breathless opening round that saw six lead changes through the first fourteen holes before Henry Meller finally seized control. His dominant back nine of 28 points—including a stunning 19-point surge through the final six holes—delivered a 49-point Stableford performance that edged Jon Baker's consistent 47-point effort by two. The round was defined by early chaos, with Meller, Baker, and David Mullin all taking turns at the summit before Meller's H14 surge proved decisive.

While Meller commands the Stableford standings, the Green Jacket gross competition tells a different story, with all six competitors clustered within striking distance. With three rounds remaining at this unforgiving Portuguese links, Meller holds just a two-point cushion—hardly comfortable given the volatility that defined this opening eighteen.

### How It Unfolded

The tournament exploded into action immediately, with lead changes at holes 2, 6, 7, 8, and 10 before Meller's decisive move at 14. Baker drew first blood, building to 16 points through six holes with Meller matching him stride for stride. The early exchanges revealed Praia D'El Rey's teeth—holes 4 and 6 both averaged 1.67 over par, causing carnage through the field.

The middle six holes descended into beautiful chaos. Mullin, who'd stormed from the gates with 15 points in his opening six, seized the lead at the par-5 8th. His hot start looked decisive until Baker reclaimed top spot at the brutal 10th hole, which proved the toughest test of the day at 1.67 over par. Behind them, Gregg Williams was quietly posting a stellar 16-point middle section, climbing into contention.

But the closing stretch belonged entirely to Meller. After the relative respite of the par-4 13th—the easiest hole with an average of just 0.33 over par—Meller detonated at the 14th, surging to 37 points and a lead he would never surrender. His 19-point rampage through the final six holes combined power and precision, turning a three-way dogfight into a two-point victory. Baker fought valiantly with 17 points in his closing stretch, matching Stuart Neumann's late charge, but Meller's momentum proved unstoppable. Mullin, so dangerous early, could manage just 12 points through the final six and slipped to fourth.

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Meller's two-point advantage is razor-thin. History suggests he'll need to average at least 45 points per round to hold off Baker, who demonstrated today he can match anyone's consistency. Baker needs roughly 48 points per round to catch Meller—achievable given his 22-front/25-back split showed no weakness. Williams, six back, remains a legitimate threat; three consecutive 47-point rounds would overtake a faltering leader.

The critical battleground sits between third and sixth. Mullin (nine back), Neumann (ten back), and Alex Baker (thirteen back) all face mathematical climbs, but Praia D'El Rey's volatility—six lead changes in one round—suggests anything is possible. Mullin's 23-point front nine proves he has the firepower; his challenge is sustaining it. Neumann's 17-point closing surge similarly demonstrates hidden gears.

The Green Jacket race remains wide open, with just eighteen strokes separating leader Meller from last-placed Alex Baker. In gross scoring, that's barely three strokes per remaining round—entirely catchable over three days of links golf.

### Round Highlights
- Six lead changes through fourteen holes before Meller's decisive H14 surge
- Meller's dominant 28-point back nine, including 19 points in the final six holes
- Mullin's explosive 15-point opening six holes, briefly seizing the lead at H8
- The brutal par-5 10th averaging 1.67 over par as the course's toughest test
- Williams' steady 43-point performance without a single lead change—lurking dangerously

### Player Summaries

**Henry MELLER:** Produced the round of the day with 49 points (21 front, 28 back), his closing 19-point surge through the final six holes seizing a two-point tournament lead in both Stableford and Green Jacket competitions.

**Jon BAKER:** Posted a consistent 47 points (22 front, 25 back) with no weak patches, involved in four lead changes throughout the round, trails by two but demonstrated he can match the leader's pace.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Quietly menacing with 43 points (21 front, 22 back), stayed out of the lead battle but maintained solid positioning throughout, sits six back and very much in the hunt.

**David MULLIN:** Started brilliantly with 15 points through six holes and briefly led at H8, but a 12-point closing stretch saw him fade to fourth, nine points off the pace but showed he has the scoring power.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Steady 39-point performance (18 front, 21 back) with a strong 17-point closing six holes demonstrating late-round gears, ten back but mathematical chances remain.

**Alex BAKER:** Struggled early with just 11 points through six holes before rallying to finish with 36 points (17 front, 19 back), faces a thirteen-point deficit that will require something special to overcome.
