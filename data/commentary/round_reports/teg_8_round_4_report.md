## Round Report

## Williams Closes in Style to Claim TEG Trophy
**Oitavos Dunes • 28/11/2015 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams arrived at Oitavos Dunes with a seven-point cushion and the chance to convert his wire-to-wire lead into silverware. Any lingering doubts evaporated across a dominant final eighteen holes as he posted 41 Stableford points to seal the TEG Trophy by a commanding 12-point margin.

Behind Williams, the battle for the runner-up spot provided the day's main intrigue. Alex Baker's relentlessly consistent 39 points, built on a blistering middle six that yielded 16 points, carried him past Jon Baker into second place overall. Baker's struggles—just 28 points as his form deserted him at the crucial moment—saw him slip from second to third in the final standings.

The course saved its cruelest test for last. The par-4 fifth emerged as a tournament wrecker, averaging over three strokes above par, whilst the brutal par-4 closing hole brought the championship to a fitting crescendo, averaging seven strokes and offering barely two-thirds of a Stableford point per player.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes set the tone for diverging fortunes. Williams posted a steady 11 points to maintain control, but it was Baker who caught the eye with 13 points from a hot start. Meanwhile, Henry Meller's title defence ended in ignominy—a catastrophic two points across the opening stretch left him scrambling for mere respectability.

The par-4 fifth proved the tournament's defining examination, claiming victims throughout the field with an average score of 7.17. Only when players reached the par-3 twelfth—the course's sole moment of mercy at half a stroke over par—could they exhale.

Williams seized command through the middle six holes. Fourteen points across that crucial stretch extended his advantage whilst Baker maintained pressure with an impressive 16-point burst. Stuart Neumann enjoyed his best spell here too, collecting 15 points to keep his round alive, but the gaps at the top were already insurmountable.

The closing stretch belonged entirely to Williams. Sixteen points across the final six holes—the best finish of anyone in the field—turned comfortable victory into emphatic statement. His back nine total of 24 points showcased a champion finding his best golf when the silverware was within reach. Baker's solid ten-point close kept him ahead of the fading Jon Baker, whose own ten points couldn't repair the damage of a weak front nine that yielded just 12.

The par-4 eighteenth provided a suitably brutal finale. Averaging seven strokes and yielding barely two-thirds of a Stableford point, it reminded every player why Oitavos Dunes had tested them so severely across four demanding rounds.

### Tournament Review

**Champion's Performance:**  
Gregg Williams never relinquished the lead he established in Round 1, demonstrating the consistency required across four days at a demanding venue. His progression told the story: 39 points on day one to seize control, followed by steady accumulation that kept challengers at arm's length. When it mattered most, he produced his second-best round of the week, the 12-point improvement from Round 3 arriving precisely when pressure might have fractured lesser performances.

**The Battle for Second:**  
Alex Baker's patient accumulation of 137 points across four rounds earned him the runner-up spot, his final-day 39 the exclamation point on relentlessly consistent scoring. Jon Baker's tournament narrative arc proved less satisfying—sitting second overnight, his 28-point finale couldn't match his earlier form, the seven-point drop from Round 3 costing him position and, perhaps, momentum when he most needed it.

**Course That Demanded Respect:**  
Oitavos Dunes lived up to its reputation as one of Portugal's most testing layouts. The par-4 fifth averaging 7.17 strokes and the closing hole's seven-stroke average reminded every competitor that this course yields nothing cheaply. That David Mullin's steady 34 points could secure fourth overall spoke volumes about the challenge—consistency mattered more than brilliance across four gruelling days.

### Round Highlights
- Williams' explosive 16-point finish across the final six holes seals wire-to-wire victory
- Baker's 16-point middle six carries him past Jon Baker into second overall
- The par-4 fifth emerges as tournament executioner—averaging 7.17, more than three over par
- Jon Baker's seven-point drop from previous round costs him runner-up position
- Brutal par-4 eighteenth averages seven strokes as fitting championship closer

### Player Summaries
**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Imperious 41-point final round confirms wire-to-wire victory, his 24-point back nine the champion's flourish the Trophy demanded.

**Alex BAKER:** Consistent 39 points built on superb middle stretch (16 points) lifts him to runner-up, finishing 12 behind champion but six clear of third.

**Jon BAKER:** Disappointing 28-point finish (down seven from R3) sees him slip from overnight second to third overall on 131 points.

**David MULLIN:** Steady 34-point performance (up eight from R3) with balanced scoring secures fourth place on 126 points.

**Henry MELLER:** Disastrous 21-point finale marked by catastrophic opening (two points first six) ends title defence in fifth on 111 points.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Strong middle section (15 points) highlights 32-point round (up 12 from R3), but remains sixth overall on 100 points.
