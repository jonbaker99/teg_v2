# TEG 17 - Round 4 Report

# Baker Seals TEG Trophy with Commanding Final Round
**Praia D'El Rey • 08/10/2024 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Praia D'El Rey on Friday with an 18-point cushion and a simple task: don't implode. He did considerably better than that, posting 40 Stableford points to seal the TEG Trophy with a commanding 18-point victory margin. His wire-to-wire triumph at TEG 17 was never in doubt, but Baker's refusal to coast home—opening with 16 points across the first six holes—ensured David Mullin's steady pursuit came to nothing.

The real drama unfolded behind the champion-elect, where John Patterson's roller-coaster round epitomized the day's contrasts. After storming through the front nine with 21 points to briefly threaten Alex Baker's podium position, Patterson's wheels came off spectacularly down the stretch. Seven points across the closing six holes left him gasping, but somehow clinging to a share of third place with Alex Baker, both finishing on 135 points. Mullin's consistent 33-point showing secured second place on 148 points, while Gregg Williams salvaged fifth after a horror start.

### How It Unfolded

The Trophy was decided before anyone reached the turn. Baker's 16-point blitz through the opening six holes—on a stretch where the field averaged barely over 10 points—effectively ended the tournament as a contest. Mullin's steady 10 points kept him ticking over, but the gap remained insurmountable. Alex Baker's 15-point start briefly suggested a family battle for the podium, but Patterson's explosive 13-point opening signaled his intentions.

The middle six holes told the story of Mullin's quiet excellence. While others wobbled, the Gross specialist rattled off 12 points to match his closing split, showcasing the consistency that secured his runner-up finish. Patterson maintained his momentum with 13 points, building a 21-point front nine that put him level with Alex Baker on 135 total points. Williams, recovering from a disastrous five-point opening, found 12 points to stay relevant.

But the final stretch belonged to Baker, who crushed any lingering doubts with 14 points across the closing holes. His authority down the stretch—matching his opener's intensity—underlined his dominance of the week. Patterson's collapse was as dramatic as his surge had been impressive, managing just seven points when a dozen would have secured third outright. Alex Baker's steady 10-point finish was enough to share the podium, while Williams' second consecutive 12-point split confirmed his recovery from that opening nightmare.
