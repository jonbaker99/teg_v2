# TEG 10 - Round 3 Report

## Five Lead Changes as Baker and Williams Storm to Deadlock
**Palmares (Alvor/Lagos) • 02/10/2017 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin arrived at Palmares holding a five-point lead and seemingly in control of TEG Trophy 10. He left the course shell-shocked, watching two players storm past him in a round that produced five lead changes and ended with Alex Baker and Gregg Williams deadlocked at the top on 133 points.

Both leaders fired matching 47-point rounds—Baker with a 22 gross, Williams with a 15—in performances that combined consistency with timely brilliance. Baker was involved in all five lead changes, trading the lead three times with Mullin in the opening six holes before Williams surged to the front at the 13th, only for Baker to reclaim it two holes later and hold on through the finish.

The drama leaves one round to play with the tournament wide open. Mullin sits just 11 points back in third after a disastrous 31-point showing, while Jon Baker lurks 16 points behind after a strong closing stretch. In the Green Jacket race, Williams' 15 gross gives him breathing room at +36, with Mullin nine strokes back on +45.

### How It Unfolded

**Early Fireworks**

The tournament exploded into life immediately. Baker seized control with 17 points across the opening six holes, taking the lead from Mullin at the par-4 4th. Mullin briefly fought back to reclaim the lead at the 5th, but Baker responded instantly, retaking control at the 6th to establish a position he would ultimately never relinquish.

Mullin's opening struggles—just 11 points compared to his second-round 19—would prove fatal to his title defense. His playing partner was setting an entirely different tone, with Baker's aggressive start laying the foundation for his joint round-winning performance.

**The Middle Grind**

The brutal par-5 8th—playing as the hardest hole with an average of 2.5 over par—tested the entire field. Williams navigated it better than most, building momentum through the middle six with 16 points to match Baker's 15. The consistent scoring from both leaders began opening gaps on their pursuers.

Mullin's challenge evaporated completely through this stretch, managing just eight points in holes 7-12. What had been a five-point overnight lead had become a growing deficit.

**The Closing Twist**

Williams made his move at the 13th, briefly taking sole possession of the lead. For two holes, it looked like the round—and potentially the tournament—might belong to him alone. But Baker responded with authority at the 15th, reclaiming the lead for the fifth and final time.

The par-5 17th, playing as the easiest hole, allowed both leaders to consolidate their positions with birdies. Behind them, Jon Baker produced the field's joint-best closing six (15 points) to keep himself in mathematical contention, while John Patterson's tournament imploded spectacularly—just nine points across the back nine after posting 18 on the front.

**Round 3 Gross:** GW +15 | JB +20 | AB +22 | DM +23 | SN +29 | JP +36

**Tournament Stableford:** AB 133 | GW 133 | DM 122 | JB 117 | SN 105 | JP 91  
**Tournament Gross:** GW +36 | DM +45 | JB +52 | AB +54 | SN +73 | JP +96

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining, the TEG Trophy remains wide open.** Baker and Williams head into the final round level on 133 points, with their destiny in their own hands. A repeat of today's performance—or anything close—should see one of them crowned champion. The mathematics are simple: win the final round and you almost certainly win the tournament.

Mullin's 11-point deficit is absolutely catchable. He needs to average 35-40 points in the final round while hoping the leaders falter. Given he's proven capable of 42-point rounds earlier in the tournament, he remains a live threat despite today's disappointment. The gap is exactly the kind that can disappear with one bad hole for the leaders or one inspired run from the chaser.

Jon Baker trails by 16 points and needs something special—probably 45+ points combined with struggles from those ahead. It's mathematically possible but requires near-perfection. Stuart Neumann (28 back) and John Patterson (42 back) are realistically out of contention barring unprecedented collapses from multiple players.

In the Green Jacket battle, Williams holds a commanding nine-stroke advantage over Mullin at +36. Baker lurks at +54, needing a superlative gross score combined with a Williams meltdown. The gross trophy appears to be heading toward Williams unless disaster strikes.

### Player Summaries

**Alex Baker:** Matched round-best 47 points (22 gross) to climb from 2nd to T1st, remarkably consistent with 17-15-15 splits across three sixes, involved in all five lead changes and now perfectly positioned heading into final round.

**Gregg Williams:** Joint round-winner with 47 points (15 gross) to move from 2nd to T1st, displayed exceptional consistency with 15-16-16 splits, briefly held sole lead at 13th, now controls both TEG Trophy (tied) and Green Jacket (+36) going into finale.

**David Mullin:** Dropped from 1st to 3rd after disappointing 31 points (23 gross), poor opening six (11 points) proved costly, fell 11 points behind leaders but remains mathematically alive needing strong final round.

**Jon Baker:** Stayed 4th with solid 35 points (20 gross), fired field's joint-best closing six (15 points), trails leaders by 16 points, needs near-perfect final round combined with leader struggles.

**Stuart Neumann:** Remained 5th with consistent 36 points (29 gross), showed gradual improvement through round with 12-10-14 splits, trails by 28 points but realistically out of title contention.

**John Patterson:** Stayed 6th after disastrous 27 points (36 gross), catastrophic back-nine collapse with only 9 points after promising 18-point front nine, trails by 42 points with tournament effectively over.
