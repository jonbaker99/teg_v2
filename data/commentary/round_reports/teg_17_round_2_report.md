## Round Report

# Mullin's Monster Round Shakes Up West Cliffs
**West Cliffs • 06/10/2024 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

The overnight leader has fallen, and the TEG Trophy race has been blown wide open at West Cliffs. John Patterson's catastrophic collapse—a 22-point round that saw him plummet from first to fifth—handed the tournament lead to Jon Baker, who now sits two points clear with two rounds remaining. But it's David Mullin's spectacular 47-point round, the best performance of the tournament so far, that has injected real drama into this competition.

Baker leads the TEG Trophy standings on 82 points, but Mullin's round-winning performance has propelled him to second place, just two points back. Meanwhile, in the Green Jacket gross competition, Mullin extended his commanding lead to seven strokes over Baker, suggesting these two competitions may well be heading for different destinations. With West Cliffs proving a stern test—particularly at the brutal par-4 3rd and par-5 13th, which averaged 2.4 shots over par—the question now is whether anyone can catch Baker's steady accumulation of points, or if Mullin's momentum will carry him to glory.

### How It Unfolded

The opening holes quickly revealed this would be no ordinary round. While Jon Baker built a solid foundation with 18 points through the first six holes, the real story was unfolding behind him. Patterson, defending his overnight lead, stumbled immediately and managed just eight points in the opening stretch. The par-4 3rd hole, playing as the day's joint-hardest, claimed multiple victims and set the tone for Patterson's dismal day.

By the turn, the tournament had been transformed. Alex Baker, quiet overnight in fifth place, had pieced together 15 points on the front nine to move into contention. Mullin, meanwhile, added a steady 14 points to stay in touch. The only brief respite came at the par-3 5th, where the field averaged just 0.2 over par, but it proved a fleeting oasis in an otherwise demanding examination.

The middle stretch belonged entirely to Mullin. Six consecutive holes from the 7th through 12th yielded an exceptional 18 points, turning what had been a solid round into something special. Baker maintained his consistency with 12 points through the same stretch, but Patterson's freefall continued—just five points as his overnight lead evaporated. By the 10th hole, multiple position changes rippled through the leaderboard as the West Cliffs course exacted its toll.

The closing stretch confirmed the new order. Mullin hammered home another 15 points from the 13th through 18th, despite the par-5 13th proving as treacherous as the 3rd had been. Baker's steady 14-point finish—matching exactly his back-nine total—saw him claim the tournament lead as Patterson could muster only nine points on the run home. Gregg Williams rallied with 14 late points, but the damage from his early struggles (just 11 points in the first six holes) had already been done. When the dust settled, Baker stood atop the leaderboard, but with Mullin's 47-point masterclass fresh in everyone's memory.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** DM 47 | JB 44 | AB 37 | GW 35 | JP 22  
**Round 2 Gross:** DM +10 | AB +17 | JB +18 | GW +21 | JP +40

**Tournament Stableford:** JB 82 | DM 80 | AB 69 | GW 68 | JP 61  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +43 | JB +50 | AB +66 | GW +72 | JP +97

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Jon Baker holds a precarious two-point lead over David Mullin in the TEG Trophy race, but that slender margin means everything remains to play for. Baker needs to average just 41 points per round to reach a typically winning total of 164 points, but with Mullin having just demonstrated he can produce 47-point rounds, the pressure is squarely on the leader. Mullin needs to average 42 points per round to catch Baker—entirely achievable given his Round 2 performance—while Baker simply cannot afford another collapse like Patterson's.

Behind them, the mathematics grow more challenging. Alex Baker sits third on 69 points, requiring an average of 47.5 points per round to catch the leader—possible but demanding near-perfection over two consecutive rounds. Gregg Williams, one point further back, needs 48 points per round, putting him on the edge of realistic contention. As for Patterson, his tournament has been devastated. Now 21 points adrift in fifth, he would need to average 51.5 points per round while hoping for a Baker collapse—mathematically possible but practically improbable.

The Green Jacket gross competition appears more settled. Mullin's seven-stroke lead over Baker means he can afford to shoot three or four strokes worse per round and still claim the gross title. The real battle there is for second place, with Baker holding a 16-stroke cushion over Alex Baker in third.

### Round Highlights
- David Mullin's 47-point round winner—18 points through the middle six holes
- John Patterson's collapse from overnight leader to fifth place (22 points, -17 vs R1)
- Jon Baker's model of consistency: 22 points on both front and back nine
- The par-4 3rd and par-5 13th averaging 2.4 over par, proving crucial separation points
- Alex Baker's 23-point front nine surge moving him up two positions

### Player Summaries

**Jon BAKER:** Steady 44-point round (22/22 split) takes him from second to first in the TEG Trophy, though his two-point lead is razor-thin. Sits second in Green Jacket competition, seven strokes behind Mullin.

**David MULLIN:** Exceptional 47-point round winner powers him to second place, just two points off the lead with momentum on his side. Extends Green Jacket gross lead to seven strokes.

**Alex BAKER:** Solid 37-point effort featuring a strong 23-point front nine, though faded to 14 on the back. Moved from fifth to third but now faces a 13-point gap to the leader.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Steady 35 points despite early struggles (11 points through six holes). Late rally of 14 points on the closing stretch shows fighting spirit but drops one position to fourth.

**John PATTERSON:** Catastrophic 22-point collapse from overnight leader to fifth place. The 17-point drop from his opening 39 represents the tournament's biggest swing and leaves him 21 points off the pace.
