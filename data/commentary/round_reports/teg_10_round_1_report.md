## Round Report

## Mullin Seizes Command After Wild Lead Battle at Boavista
**Boavista • 30 September 2017 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The opening salvo of TEG 10 delivered high-octane drama as seven lead changes through the first 12 holes set the tone before David Mullin seized control and never looked back. Starting the day level with the field, Mullin produced a masterful performance to card 49 Stableford points and shoot 4-over gross, establishing an eight-point buffer over Alex Baker heading into Sunday's second round.

The early exchanges resembled a heavyweight boxing match, with Jon Baker, Alex Baker, and Mullin trading blows through the front nine and into the back. But once Mullin grabbed the lead at the par-4 12th, he was unstoppable—rattling off 20 points over the closing six holes to pull clear. Alex Baker held firm for second with 41 points, while Gregg Williams' steady 38-point effort earned third. The day ended in carnage at the notorious 18th, where a 7.33 stroke average against par yielded just 0.83 points per player.

### How It Unfolded

The Baker brothers dominated the early narrative at Boavista. Jon struck first with a blistering start through two holes, building a six-point total to claim the early advantage. But by the par-5 6th, elder brother Alex had clawed back into the lead with 14 points, setting the stage for a fascinating family duel.

Then Mullin entered the chat. The par-4 7th proved pivotal as he seized his first lead of the day with 17 points accumulated, though Jon Baker wasn't finished—he briefly reclaimed top spot at the turn with 22 points through nine. The lead changed hands again at the 10th (Mullin), then remarkably once more at the 11th when Alex surged back to 26 points.

The decisive moment arrived at the par-3 12th. Mullin moved ahead with 29 points and suddenly found another gear entirely. Over the next six holes, he was simply untouchable—producing 20 points in a devastating late surge that turned a tight contest into a procession. His back-nine tally of 28 points included this extraordinary closing stretch that left challengers gasping.

Behind the leader, positions solidified. Alex Baker's consistency—14 points over the final six—secured second place comfortably. Gregg Williams, who never led but never faltered, balanced his card perfectly with 19 points on each nine. Jon Baker's challenge evaporated on the inward half (just 15 points after his 22-point front nine), while Stuart Neumann authored the day's most dramatic collapse. After an excellent middle-six stretch worth 16 points, Neumann managed just six over the closing holes to tumble down the leaderboard.

The 18th provided a brutal finale for everyone. The par-4 closer averaged more than seven strokes, producing carnage across the field and serving as a stark reminder of Boavista's bite.

### Standings After Round 1

**Round 1 Stableford:** DM 49 | AB 41 | GW 38 | JB 37 | SN 32 | JP 29  
**Round 1 Gross:** DM +4 | JB +18 | GW +25 | AB +28 | JP +31 | SN +36

**Tournament Stableford:** DM 49 | AB 41 | GW 38 | JB 37 | SN 32 | JP 29  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +4 | JB +18 | GW +25 | AB +28 | JP +31 | SN +36

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Mullin's eight-point advantage is significant but far from insurmountable over 54 holes. In Stableford, an average round typically yields 32-38 points, meaning Alex Baker needs to average roughly 40-42 points per round while hoping Mullin cools to the mid-30s. That's a tall order against someone who just posted 49, but three rounds provide ample opportunity for momentum swings.

The race remains wide open behind the top two. Williams trails by 11 points—still catchable with a strong second round that could pull him within striking distance. Jon Baker, 12 back, showed his ceiling with that 22-point front nine and needs to rediscover that form while maintaining consistency over 18 holes. The gap to sixth is 20 points, but with three rounds remaining, even John Patterson has mathematical possibilities.

In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's gross score advantage is commanding—he's 14 strokes clear of Jon Baker. However, gross scores tend to be more volatile than Stableford points, and a single disaster round could bring the field back into contention. The spoon battle appears destined for a private duel between Stuart Neumann and John Patterson, separated by just three points after one round.

### Round Highlights

- Seven lead changes through 12 holes created early drama reminiscent of a heavyweight prizefight
- David Mullin's closing surge: 20 Stableford points over the final six holes to blow the field apart
- Stuart Neumann's tale of two halves: 16 points in the middle six, just 6 over the final six
- The 18th hole lived up to its fearsome reputation, averaging 7.33 strokes against par and yielding only 0.83 points per player
- Jon Baker's front-nine fireworks (22 points) couldn't be sustained on the back nine (15 points)

### Player Summaries

**David MULLIN:** Produced a statement round with 49 Stableford points (4-over gross) to seize an eight-point lead, dominating the back nine with 28 points including a devastating 20-point closing surge. Leads both TEG Trophy and Green Jacket competitions heading into Round 2.

**Alex BAKER:** Solid 41-point performance (28-over gross) secures second place eight points back, featuring strong back-nine consistency with 23 points and two brief spells in the lead before Mullin's surge proved insurmountable.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Steady 38-point effort (25-over gross) claims third, never threatening the lead but maintaining excellent balance with 19 points on each nine to position himself 11 points back with three rounds to play.

**Jon BAKER:** Explosive front nine (22 points) included two lead moments, but 15 back-nine points saw him fade to fourth with 37 points total (18-over gross), now 12 points off the pace.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Dramatic collapse from promising position—excellent middle six holes (16 points) followed by disastrous closing six (just 6 points) left him with 32 points (36-over gross) in fifth, 17 points adrift.

**John PATTERSON:** Struggled throughout for 29 points (31-over gross) and sixth place, finding brief rhythm in the middle stretch (14 points) but bookended by poor opening (7 points) and closing (8 points) sixes, now 20 points behind the leader.
