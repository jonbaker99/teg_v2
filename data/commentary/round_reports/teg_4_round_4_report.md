## Round Report

# Mullin Snatches Trophy with Final Round Heroics
**Bletchingley • 01/09/2011 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker stood on the brink of Trophy glory with a one-point lead entering the final round at Bletchingley, but David Mullin had other plans. After matching Baker shot-for-shot through the opening six holes, Mullin watched his rival surge clear with an eagle at the par-4 8th. But as the course bared its teeth on the brutal middle stretch, everything changed. Mullin's steady accumulation wore down Baker's challenge, and when he reclaimed the lead at the 14th, there was no looking back. A back-nine collapse from Baker—just 9 points after his rampant 23-point front nine—handed Mullin a 36-point round victory and the TEG Trophy by a three-point margin.

Henry Meller's superb 34-point effort secured third place, while Stuart Neumann's consistent 32 points couldn't prevent him slipping to fourth. Gregg Williams struggled to 23 points and fifth position, but the day belonged to Mullin, who claimed both the round honours and the tournament title with a composed final-round masterclass.

### How It Unfolded

#### Opening Salvos

The opening six holes were a prize-fight stalemate. Mullin and Baker traded blows, each collecting 15 points as the lead changed hands at the second hole in Baker's favour. Meller lurked ominously with 14 points, while Neumann's solid 11 kept him in touch. Williams, with just 6, had already slipped from contention.

Then came the haymaker. At the par-4 8th, Baker struck an eagle—two gross strokes, five Stableford points—that seemed destined to break the deadlock. His lead stretched, his confidence soared, and the Trophy appeared his for the taking.

#### The Turning Point

Bletchingley's teeth emerged on the back nine. The par-4 10th played 2.4 strokes over par on average, yielding a miserly 0.8 Stableford points across the field. The 11th was even worse at 2.8 over par. This was golf's equivalent of deep water, and only the strongest swimmers would survive.

Baker began to sink. His second six holes yielded just 9 points—half the haul he'd banked over the opening stretch. Mullin, meanwhile, ground out 8 points through the carnage, staying patient, staying close. At the 14th, the decisive moment arrived: Mullin reclaimed the lead at 128 points total, and Baker had no response.

#### Final Stretch Drama

The par-5 15th—the round's hardest hole at 3.2 over par—extinguished Baker's flickering hopes entirely. Mullin powered through the closing six with 13 points, his consistent splits of 15-8-13 across the three six-hole segments telling the story of a player who never panicked. Baker managed only 8 points on the final stretch, completing a catastrophic back-nine collapse: 9 points after his 23-point front nine.

Meller's 12-point finish secured third place on 121 points, capping a fine recovery from his 23-point third round. Neumann's steady 10 points couldn't prevent fourth place, while Williams limped home with 6 to finish fifth overall.

### Final Standings

**Round 4 Stableford:** DM 36 | HM 34 | JB 32 | SN 32 | GW 23  
**Round 4 Gross:** DM +19 | SN +22 | HM +24 | JB +33 | GW +43

**Tournament Stableford:** DM 137 | JB 134 | HM 121 | SN 120 | GW 110  
**Tournament Gross:** JB +114 | DM +123 | SN +125 | HM +125 | GW +168

**TEG Trophy Champion:** David MULLIN (137 pts)  
**Green Jacket Champion:** Jon BAKER (+114 gross)

### Round Highlights

- **Eagle drama:** Baker's monster eagle at the par-4 8th (2 gross, 5 points) temporarily broke the deadlock
- **Lead changes:** Tournament lead swapped twice—Baker seizing control at the 2nd, Mullin reclaiming it at the 14th
- **Back-nine meltdown:** Baker's 23-point front nine contrasted starkly with his 9-point collapse on the back
- **Brutal stretch:** Holes 10-11 averaged 2.4 and 2.8 over par respectively, separating pretenders from contenders
- **Perfect timing:** Mullin's 13-point finish sealed the Trophy with authority

### Player Summaries

**David MULLIN:** Claimed both the round and the Trophy with a controlled 36-point performance, never losing composure even when Baker's eagle threatened to break clear. Four-round consistency (35-37-29-36) proved the winning formula, and his balanced 15-8-13 splits showed the temperament of a champion.

**Jon BAKER:** Front-loaded brilliance gave way to back-nine despair. His eagle at the 8th and rampant 23-point front nine suggested Trophy glory, but 9 points over the final stretch—including capitulation at the brutal 15th—left him three points adrift despite winning the Green Jacket for lowest gross score across the four rounds.

**Henry MELLER:** Bounced back superbly from Round 3's struggles with 34 points, including a strong 16-point back nine that secured third place overall. His 24 gross strokes represented solid ball-striking when it mattered most.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Consistent as ever with 32 points and an 11-11-10 split, but consistency alone couldn't match the leaders' firepower. Dropped from third to fourth but never embarrassed himself on a demanding day.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Struggled throughout with 23 points, his 13-10 split reflecting difficulties on both nines. A 43 gross total highlighted a tough final round, dropping from fourth to fifth as the trophy race intensified without him.
