## Round Report

## Four Lead Changes Mark Boavista Thriller as Mullin Holds On by One

**Boavista • 04/06/2012 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

David MULLIN emerged from a dramatic second round at Boavista clinging to a one-point lead after trading the advantage four times with Gregg WILLIAMS in a pulsating battle that went down to the treacherous 18th hole. Starting the day one point behind overnight leader Jon BAKER, MULLIN fired 40 points to reach 79 total and edge WILLIAMS (78) by the narrowest of margins in the TEG Trophy standings.

The day belonged to Stuart NEUMANN, whose spectacular 45-point round – a 15-point improvement on his opening effort – lifted him from last place to fourth. But while NEUMANN's surge provided the day's feel-good story, the lead battle provided unrelenting tension as MULLIN and WILLIAMS exchanged blows across the back nine before MULLIN seized control at the par-4 14th and held firm through the brutal closer at 18th, where the field averaged 2.6 over par.

WILLIAMS moved from third to second with his 42-point effort, while BAKER's title defence hit trouble early. The defending champion managed just 11 points in the opening six holes and despite steadying the ship, slipped from first to third, now three points adrift with two rounds remaining.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes set the tone for a day of extremes. While Stuart NEUMANN blazed out of the blocks with 16 points, Jon BAKER's defence of his overnight lead crumbled immediately. The Round 1 leader could muster only 11 points through the first third of the course – nine points worse than NEUMANN's blistering start – and by the par-4 6th, Gregg WILLIAMS had accumulated 17 points to seize the tournament lead at 53 total.

WILLIAMS held top spot for just two holes. The par-5 8th – playing as the joint-easiest hole at 3.4 points average – witnessed 11 significant scoring events and proved the scene of the day's first momentum shift. David MULLIN's 17-point surge through the middle six holes propelled him to 59 points and back into the lead he'd briefly held in Round 1. NEUMANN continued his remarkable resurrection with another 17-point split, but BAKER's steadier 14 points merely kept him within touching distance rather than closing the gap his poor start had created.

**The Back Nine Battle**

The final six holes delivered championship drama. WILLIAMS's 20-point finish matched NEUMANN's for the day's best closing split, and at the par-4 13th, he moved back ahead at 70 points total. MULLIN's response was immediate and decisive. The 14th hole – which saw six scoring events – became the defining moment as MULLIN reclaimed the advantage at 72 points and refused to relinquish it.

As WILLIAMS and MULLIN traded blows, Henry MELLER's challenge disintegrated. The overnight fourth-place holder managed just five points in the final six holes, turning a competitive position into a 15-point deficit. The par-4 18th, averaging just 0.8 Stableford points and playing as the day's toughest examination, provided a nerve-shredding finale where MULLIN held his nerve to protect his slender advantage.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** SN 45 | GW 42 | DM 40 | JB 36 | HM 30  
**Round 2 Gross:** SN +11 | DM +15 | GW +18 | JB +22 | HM +28

**Tournament Stableford:** DM 79 | GW 78 | JB 76 | SN 75 | HM 64  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +54 | GW +54 | JB +62 | SN +83 | HM +94

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

David MULLIN's one-point cushion over Gregg WILLIAMS sets up a straight shootout for the TEG Trophy, with Jon BAKER lurking just three points back and Stuart NEUMANN a further point adrift at four behind. The mathematics are simple but brutal: MULLIN needs to average just under 40 points per round to reach a competitive 157 total, but WILLIAMS – who posted 42 today – has shown he can match or exceed that pace. BAKER needs approximately 41 points per round to catch MULLIN's current trajectory, while NEUMANN requires roughly 42.5 points per round despite his brilliant 45-point performance today.

The top three remain tightly bunched, with gaps that a single strong round could erase. WILLIAMS demonstrated today that he can post the low score of the day and will fancy his chances to overhaul a one-point deficit. BAKER's three-point gap is catchable but requires he rediscover the form that earned him the overnight lead – his 36-point effort today won't cut it. NEUMANN's remarkable turnaround keeps him mathematically alive, but he'll need to maintain his Round 2 excellence while hoping for stumbles ahead.

At the bottom, Henry MELLER faces a mountain at 15 points back. He'd need to average 47.5 points per round while hoping MULLIN averages under 33 – a mathematical possibility but a practical impossibility given current form. The realistic battle remains at the top, where three players are separated by just three points heading into a pivotal Round 3.

### Round Highlights

- Stuart NEUMANN's 45-point masterclass – best round of tournament and 15-point improvement on Round 1
- Four lead changes between MULLIN and WILLIAMS create dramatic narrative through middle and closing holes
- The par-5 8th witnesses 11 scoring events as MULLIN seizes first lead of the day
- Par-4 14th provides decisive moment as MULLIN reclaims lead for the final time with six scoring events
- Brutal par-4 18th (averaging just 0.8 points) delivers nerve-shredding finale where MULLIN holds on by single point

### Player Summaries

**Henry MELLER:** Collapse from fourth to fifth after 30-point round included disastrous five-point finish in final six holes; now 15 points behind at 64 total and mathematically challenged. His +94 gross leaves him well back in Green Jacket standings.
