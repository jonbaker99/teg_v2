# TEG 16 - Round 2 Report

# Neumann Extends Command with Dominant Middle Six
**Troia Golf Course • 08/10/2023 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Stuart Neumann arrived at Troia holding a slender lead after Round 1, but the tournament needed clarity. Would the chasing pack close in, or would someone step away? Neumann delivered his answer emphatically, carding 35 Stableford points to extend his advantage to seven with the halfway point reached. While the leader controlled proceedings from the front, the real drama unfolded behind him as David Mullin surged two positions to claim second place, Jon Baker and Gregg Williams swapped spots in a heated position battle, and Alex Baker mounted a middle-round resurrection that kept his tournament hopes flickering. With two rounds remaining at this unforgiving Portuguese layout, Neumann has built breathing room but not yet delivered a knockout blow.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes provided little indication of what would follow. All five players started cautiously, with David Mullin and Jon Baker both posting 12 points to edge ahead of Neumann's 11. The par-3 4th hole drew first blood, playing two over par and reminding everyone that Troia gives nothing away cheaply. Through six, the gaps remained tight, the tournament still anyone's to seize.

Then came the middle six, where Neumann transformed the leaderboard. From the 7th through the 12th, he accumulated 16 points in a devastating display of consistency, pulling clear of the field while others scrambled to keep pace. The par-4 8th proved the round's toughest examination, averaging 6.2 strokes and yielding barely half a Stableford point. Yet Neumann navigated the danger, and when the 10th hole—the day's easiest, playing to par with 3.2 points available—arrived, he capitalised while others merely survived. Behind him, Alex Baker produced his own 14-point surge through this stretch, dragging himself back into tournament relevance, but it was Neumann's controlled excellence that redrew the standings.

The closing stretch might have invited pressure, but Neumann refused the script. While four of the final six holes averaged two over par, testing nerves and technique in equal measure, the leader posted 8 points to seal a 19-point back nine. David Mullin and Gregg Williams both managed 11 points over the closing six, the former's consistency earning him second place, the latter's effort unable to arrest a two-position slide. Jon Baker closed with 9, enough to hold third but not enough to threaten the top two. Most damaging was Alex Baker's stumble—just 8 points over the final six holes squandered his middle-six heroics and left him marooned in fifth, his 14-point surge nothing more than a failed escape attempt.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Stuart Neumann's seven-point cushion demands respect, but this tournament remains wide open. To secure the TEG Trophy, he needs only average 31.5 points per round over the final two days—a target within comfortable reach given his 35-39 start. The mathematics favour him, but Troia's difficulty means nothing is guaranteed until the final putt drops.

David Mullin sits perfectly positioned in second, requiring 37.5 points per round to catch Neumann if the leader falters. That's a steep ask, but his consistent 33-34 scoring pattern suggests he can apply pressure. Jon Baker, just one point adrift in third, needs similar heroics—38 points per round—while Gregg Williams must find 40 points per round from fourth, a target that demands both inspiration and mistakes from those ahead. Alex Baker faces the longest odds from fifth, needing 41.5 points per round, though his 14-point middle-six surge in Round 2 proves he possesses the capability to produce big numbers when fortune smiles.

The Green Jacket competition for lowest gross score remains tighter, with just six strokes separating the top four. Every bogey saved or birdie made carries weight in this secondary battle.
