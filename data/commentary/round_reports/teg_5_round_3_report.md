## Round Report

## Final Hole Heartbreak as Williams Snatches Trophy Lead
**Boavista • 05/06/2012 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin started Tuesday's third round atop the TEG Trophy leaderboard, but by day's end, a different battle had consumed Boavista. After 18 holes of relentless drama, Gregg Williams leads by the narrowest of margins—just one point over Jon Baker heading into tomorrow's final round.

Baker produced the round of the day with 38 points, seizing the lead on the penultimate hole only to watch it slip away in agonizing fashion on the 18th. Williams, meanwhile, delivered when it mattered most, his clutch 18-point back nine (including 12 points over the brutal closing six) enough to reclaim top spot on the final hole. Behind them, Stuart Neumann moved up to third despite a 13-point drop from his Round 2 heroics, while Mullin's catastrophic 27-point collapse saw him plummet from first to fourth. With one round to play, the Trophy is wide open.

### How It Unfolded

The opening exchanges belonged to Henry Meller, who dominated the first six holes with 15 points to briefly threaten the leaders. But the real story was unfolding at the top, where Williams posted a solid 15 points through six to overtake Mullin at the par-3 third. The overnight leader managed just 10 points over the same stretch, an ominous sign of the struggles ahead.

The middle section saw Baker make his move. Fourteen points from holes 7-12 propelled him up the leaderboard, matching Neumann's strong surge through the same stretch. Meller maintained his consistency with 13 points, while Williams slipped to just 10 but crucially held his lead. Mullin, however, continued to fade with another 10-point segment, now trailing badly.

Then came the chaos. The par-5 13th proved a disaster for everyone—averaging 7.2 strokes against par and yielding just 1.2 points per player. Baker somehow navigated it best, and his brilliant 12-point finish over the closing six gave him the round and, briefly, the tournament lead when he seized control at the 17th.

But the 17th and 18th holes transformed this round into theatre. The penultimate hole saw eight separate scoring events and multiple position shifts. The 18th—a par-4 that averaged a horrific 7.4 strokes and just 0.6 points—witnessed 10 scoring events in a festival of carnage. Williams held his nerve while Baker suffered final-hole heartbreak, the lead changing hands one last time as 32 gross strokes proved just enough to edge Baker's superior 24.

### Standings After Round 3

**Round 3 Stableford:** JB 38 | GW 37 | HM 36 | SN 32 | DM 27  
**Round 3 Gross:** HM +20 | JB +24 | DM +27 | SN +27 | GW +32

**Tournament Stableford:** GW 115 | JB 114 | SN 107 | DM 106 | HM 100  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +75 | JB +84 | GW +97 | SN +99 | HM +106

### What's At Stake

**With 1 round remaining:**

Williams leads by a single point, but Baker's superior gross score (13 strokes better) means he controls his destiny in both competitions. The Green Jacket chase heavily favors Baker—Mullin leads by nine gross strokes but would need a monumental collapse from Baker to defend it.

For the Trophy, Williams needs to match or better Baker's round by just one point to claim victory. Baker must outscore Williams by two points to overtake him. Given Baker's 38-point performance today versus Williams' 37, this sets up a compelling head-to-head finale. Neumann trails by eight points—he'd need a 45-point masterclass (matching his Round 2 brilliance) combined with leaders stumbling to steal the trophy. Mullin, nine back, is mathematically alive but would require miracle territory: a 50-point round while Williams and Baker both implode.

The spoon battle has intensified. Meller trails Mullin by just six points but sits 15 behind the leaders. His improved 36-point round suggests he's finding form at precisely the wrong time to challenge for silverware, but the right time to escape wooden cutlery.

### Round Highlights
- Three lead changes across 18 holes, with the final shift coming on the last hole
- The 13th hole averaged 5.2 shots over par, yielding just 1.2 points per player
- Baker's round-winning 38 points included a spectacular 12-point finish
- The 18th played as the hardest hole of the tournament so far (7.4 average vs par 4)
- Eight players recorded scoring events at 17, ten at 18—pure carnage

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** His 37-point round included a nerveless back nine (18 points) and clutch closing stretch (12 points over the final six) to snatch the lead on the final hole. Leads Trophy by one, trails Jacket by 13.

**Jon Baker:** The day's standout performance—38 points and 24 gross—saw him win the round but agonizingly miss the overall lead after final-hole drama. One point back in Trophy, commanding 13-stroke Jacket lead.

**Stuart Neumann:** A 13-point drop from his Round 2 heroics (45 points) yielded 32 today, but he moved up to third. Eight points off the Trophy lead with everything to play for tomorrow.

**David Mullin:** Catastrophic collapse from overnight leader—27 points marked a 13-point drop from Round 2. Tumbled from first to fourth and now trails by nine points. Still leads Jacket but vulnerable.

**Henry Meller:** A six-point improvement (36 points, 20 gross) with a dominant opening six holes (15 points) showed renewed form. Fifteen points adrift in Trophy but closing the gap on Mullin for spoon avoidance.
