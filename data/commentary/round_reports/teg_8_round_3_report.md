## Round Report

## Baker's Back Nine Blitz Closes the Gap

**Quinta da Marinha • 27/11/2015 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams arrived at Quinta da Marinha holding a seven-point cushion, but his commanding lead took a significant hit as Jon Baker produced the round of the day with 35 points. While Williams posted a respectable 29 points to maintain pole position, his advantage has shrunk to just five points heading into Sunday's finale. The drama came not from the front, where Williams controlled the early holes, but from Baker's spectacular back-nine surge that has transformed what looked like a comfortable procession into a genuine two-horse race.

The round proved a tale of two nines. Williams dominated the opening stretch, racing to 18 points on the front nine, but faded badly after the turn with just 11 on the back. Baker followed the opposite trajectory, grinding through a difficult middle section before exploding with 20 points on the inward half—including a devastating 14-point haul over the final six holes. Behind them, Alex Baker held third with a solid 32 points, while David Mullin's struggles saw him slip from joint-third to fourth after managing just 26 points.

### How It Unfolded

Williams stamped his authority early, collecting 14 points through the opening six holes to extend his tournament lead. Alex Baker kept pace with 13 points, while Jon Baker banked a steady 12 to stay within touching distance. At the opposite end, Stuart Neumann's challenge collapsed with a disastrous four-point start that effectively ended his hopes.

The middle six holes proved the day's decisive battleground. Williams pushed his front-nine total to an impressive 18 points, but everyone else hit trouble. The par-5 10th—which played as the hardest hole with an average of 7.83, nearly three strokes over par—became the scene of multiple disasters. Jon Baker managed just nine points across holes seven through twelve, Alex Baker collected only seven, and David Mullin's challenge stalled with a mere six points. Only Henry Meller thrived, posting the field's best second-six total of 15 points to storm back into contention.

The tournament's complexion changed dramatically over the closing stretch. Baker caught fire, devastating Williams' lead with 14 points in the final six holes. His back-nine total of 20 points represented a remarkable turnaround and cut five points off Williams' advantage. The par-4 17th—the day's easiest hole—saw Baker capitalize while Williams could only watch his cushion evaporate. Alex Baker stayed steady with 12 points to secure third place, but his brother's late charge has set up a fascinating final-round showdown. Williams' fade to just eight points over the closing six left him vulnerable, though still in control heading to Sunday.

**Tournament Gross:** JB +59 | GW +61 | AB +74 | DM +81 | HM +91 | SN +118

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:**

Williams holds a five-point advantage, but it's far from insurmountable. History shows that leads can evaporate quickly at Quinta da Marinha, and Williams' back-nine fade raises questions about his ability to close. To secure the TEG Trophy, he needs to match Baker's intensity or hope his rival falters—even a 25-point round would likely suffice if Baker drops back to his early-tournament form. But if Williams produces another split performance, he's vulnerable.

Baker needs to average 36 points to catch Williams if the leader posts 30, or could get there with 33-34 points if Williams struggles again. His 35-point performance today, improving on his 34 from Round 2, suggests he's hitting peak form at precisely the right moment. The momentum is entirely with him after that back-nine demolition. Alex Baker sits 10 points back in third—mathematically alive if both leaders collapse, but realistically needing something extraordinary. Even a career-best 40 points wouldn't help unless Williams and Jon Baker both post mid-20s rounds.

The battle for fourth has tightened, with Mullin just two points ahead of Meller after today's struggles. Neumann's 40-point deficit means he's playing for pride, though avoiding the wooden spoon remains a consolation goal. In the Green Jacket race, Jon Baker leads Williams by two strokes, adding an extra layer of intrigue to Sunday's showdown.

### Round Highlights

- Jon Baker's back-nine explosion: 20 points, including 14 over the final six holes, to slash Williams' lead in half
- Gregg Williams' front-nine masterclass: 18 points to briefly extend his advantage before fading
- The par-5 10th carnage: averaged 7.83 strokes, nearly three over par, destroying multiple challenges
- Henry Meller's middle-six surge: 15 points across holes 7-12 when everyone else struggled
- Stuart Neumann's opening collapse: just four points through six holes ended his tournament hopes

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Posted 29 points with contrasting nines—dominant 18-point front followed by worrying 11-point back nine. Leads tournament by five but momentum has shifted. Still favorite but vulnerable.

**Jon Baker:** Won the round with 35 points, producing a spectacular 20-point back nine including 14 over the final six holes. Closed gap from seven to five points and carries all the momentum into Sunday's finale.

**Alex Baker:** Solid 32 points with perfectly balanced 16-point halves keeps him in third place, now 10 points off the lead. Consistent but lacks the firepower to challenge unless both leaders stumble badly.

**David Mullin:** Struggled throughout with 26 points (9-6-11 splits) and dropped from joint-third to fourth. Now 16 points back and facing a battle with Meller for the final podium spot rather than trophy contention.

**Henry Meller:** Second-best round of 34 points, highlighted by remarkable 15-point middle section. Moved to within two points of Mullin in fourth but remains 18 points off the lead—too far back for trophy hopes.

**Stuart Neumann:** Disastrous 20 points including four-point opening six effectively ended his week. Now 40 points adrift in sixth and playing to avoid last place rather than competing for silverware.
