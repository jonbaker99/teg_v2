## Round Report

# Baker Seals Wire-to-Wire Victory at Praia D'El Rey
**Praia D'El Rey • 08/10/2024 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker claimed the TEG Trophy with a commanding wire-to-wire victory at Praia D'El Rey, signing off with a steady 40-point final round to finish 18 points clear of David Mullin. Having led from the opening day, Baker was never seriously threatened despite his round tally dropping from Thursday's spectacular 44 points to Sunday's more modest total.

The final round belonged firmly to Baker, whose 21-point front nine effectively ended any lingering doubt about the outcome. The only real drama came in the battle for third, where John Patterson's blistering 21-point start propelled him alongside Alex Baker in joint third place. Meanwhile, David Mullin's consistent 33-point effort secured second place in both the Trophy and the Green Jacket competitions, completing a tournament of admirable steadiness on the Portuguese coast.

### How It Unfolded

The championship's fate was never really in doubt, but the opening holes provided a stern examination of the field's resolve. The par-4 1st hole, which had tormented players all week with an average score of 3.2 over par, struck again. Only as players reached the par-5 2nd – the tournament's easiest hole – did scoring opportunities emerge, offering brief respite with its generous 2.6-point average.

Baker's dominance was established early, accumulating 16 points through the opening six holes while Alex Baker kept pace with 15. The surprise package was Patterson, whose 13-point start hinted at a late charge. At the other end of the spectrum, Gregg Williams endured a nightmare opening, limping to just 5 points through the first third of his round.

The middle section of the course, from holes 7 through 12, brought the most significant shifts. While Baker consolidated with a steady 10 points, Williams staged a remarkable recovery, matching Mullin's section-best 12 points. Patterson maintained his momentum with another 13-point stretch, but Alex Baker's challenge faltered dramatically, managing just 7 points through this crucial phase.

The par-4 10th hole, the course's second most difficult, marked the beginning of a testing stretch that would determine final positions. By the time players reached the par-5 15th, where four significant moments unfolded, the leaderboard was taking its final shape. The par-4 16th offered one last birdie opportunity, averaging 2.8 Stableford points, but it was Baker who seized the closing holes most effectively. His 14-point finish was the round's best, while Patterson's challenge evaporated with a disappointing 7-point close that cost him outright third place.

### Standings After Round 4

**Round 4 Stableford:** JB 40 | JP 33 | DM 33 | AB 32 | GW 29

**Round 4 Gross:** JB +19 | DM +24 | GW +25 | JP +35 | AB +38

**Final Stableford Standings:** JB 166 | DM 148 | AB 135 | JP 135 | GW 123

**Final Gross Standings:** DM +88 | JB +92 | AB +142 | GW +149 | JP +164

### Round Highlights

- Jon Baker's dominant 21-point front nine eliminated any final-round drama
- John Patterson's spectacular opening nine (21 points) briefly threatened a late charge
- The brutal par-4 1st continued its week-long reign of terror, averaging 3.2 over par
- Gregg Williams staged a remarkable recovery from a 5-point disaster start to score 24 points over his final 12 holes
- David Mullin's model of consistency: 10-12-11 point splits across the three six-hole sections

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Capped a dominant wire-to-wire victory with 40 points (19 gross), never relinquishing the lead he seized on day one. His 21-point front nine in the final round effectively ended the tournament as a contest, claiming both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket with authority.

**David Mullin:** Finished a model of consistency with 33 points (24 gross) to secure second place in both competitions. His 17-16 split and steady 10-12-11 progression through the three six-hole sections epitomised his tournament-long reliability, finishing 18 points behind Baker in the Trophy standings.

**Alex Baker:** Closed with 32 points (38 gross) to share third place after a final round of two halves. His promising 19-point front nine was undermined by a middle-six collapse (7 points), though he recovered with 10 points over the closing stretch.

**John Patterson:** Surged into joint third with an impressive 33-point effort (35 gross), climbing one position thanks to a sensational 21-point front nine. His momentum disappeared over the back nine, where just 12 points represented a missed opportunity for outright third.

**Gregg Williams:** Salvaged 29 points (25 gross) from what began as a catastrophic round, his opening six holes yielding just 5 points. The recovery was remarkable – 12 points in both the middle and closing sections – but the damage was done, leaving him in fifth place, 43 points adrift.
