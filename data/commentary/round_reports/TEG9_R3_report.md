# TEG 9 - Round 3 Report

## Baker Surges But Patterson Holds Firm at Royal Óbidos
**Royal Óbidos • 02/10/2016 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

With one round remaining and John Patterson holding a seemingly comfortable lead, the question entering Round 3 was simple: could anyone mount a serious challenge? Alex Baker emphatically answered with a commanding 42-point performance, but Patterson's steady 34-point response kept him three points clear at the top. The real drama played out in the battle for the minor placings, where Jon Baker's catastrophic mid-round collapse saw his brother leapfrog him into outright second, while David Mullin's continued decline dropped him into a tie for third.

The round began with Jon Baker threatening to blow the tournament wide open, scorching through the opening six holes with 18 points. But Royal Óbidos had other ideas, and what started as a potential championship charge ended as a cautionary tale in golf's cruelty. As Jon crumbled on the back nine, Alex seized his moment, dominating the front nine with 24 points to inject genuine tension into the final round. With just 18 holes remaining, Patterson needs barely a point per hole to secure the TEG Trophy, but Baker's surge has ensured this won't be a coronation.

### How It Unfolded

Royal Óbidos bared its teeth early at the par-4 4th, the hardest hole on the course, where the field averaged a brutal 6.33 strokes—more than two over par. But it was Jon Baker who initially weathered the storm best, racing through the opening stretch with 18 points in six holes. His brother Alex wasn't far behind on 16 points, while Patterson kept his powder dry with a measured start.

Then came the middle six holes, where Jon's dream died and Stuart Neumann's round came alive. Neumann caught fire with 16 points through holes 7-12—the best split of the day—while Jon managed just six points in the same stretch, watching his challenge evaporate in real time. The par-5 11th proved particularly vicious, averaging 7.0 strokes and yielding a miserly 1.33 points on average. Alex Baker held steady through this section while Gregg Williams quietly built momentum with 14 points, positioning himself for a strong finish.

The closing stretch belonged to the leaders protecting their positions. Alex Baker sealed his 42-point round with 14 points over the final six holes, securing his move to outright second. Patterson, playing percentage golf, matched Alex's closing split with 13 points to maintain his three-point cushion. The par-3 13th offered brief respite as the easiest hole of the day, but the par-5 18th restored order with another 7.0-stroke average, ensuring no late heroics could rewrite the leaderboard. Williams produced the back nine of the day with 20 points, but it only kept him fifth, while Neumann's earlier surge earned him a solid 37-point round that lifted him off the bottom but left him 31 points adrift.

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:**

John Patterson stands on the brink of the TEG Trophy, needing to average just 1 point per hole over the final 18 to guarantee victory—a target so modest that only catastrophe could deny him. His three-point cushion over Alex Baker means even a poor round should suffice, but Patterson's consistent scoring (34, 38, 49, 34 across four rounds) suggests he won't crumble. Baker, meanwhile, needs to gain four points while hoping Patterson stumbles. Given Baker's recent form—42 and 44 points in his last two rounds—another big score is possible, but Patterson would need to post his worst round of the tournament for the lead to change hands.

Behind the leaders, the battle for third offers genuine intrigue. David Mullin and Jon Baker sit deadlocked on 110 points, with Mullin holding a commanding 22-stroke advantage in the Green Jacket competition. Gregg Williams, five points back, needs a vintage performance and a collapse from those ahead to reach the podium. The real story might be whether either Baker brother can overhaul Mullin's gross score advantage—Jon trails by 22 strokes, Alex by 14—in what shapes as a tighter Green Jacket race than the Stableford standings suggest.

For Stuart Neumann, 31 points adrift in sixth, the Trophy is beyond reach, but pride and a potential move up the order remain at stake. The Wooden Spoon battle appears settled unless Neumann suffers a complete meltdown in the final round.

- Jon Baker's opening salvo: 18 points through six holes threatens to rewrite the tournament
