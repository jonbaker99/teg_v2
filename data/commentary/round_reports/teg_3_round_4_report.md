## Round Report

# Baker Claims Wire-to-Wire Victory at Boavista
**Boavista • 08/10/2010 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Boavista's final round with a commanding 19-point cushion and the composure to see it home. In conditions that demanded control over heroics, Baker delivered a measured 36-point performance to claim the TEG Trophy with 164 points total, finishing 17 points clear of David Mullin. While the margin suggested comfortable viewing, Mullin's aggressive early pursuit and Henry Meller's spectacular late surge ensured Baker couldn't afford complacency.

The final round followed the script Baker had written across three dominant previous rounds. No position changes occurred all day—a testament to the gaps he'd established—but the drama lay in whether anyone could mount the extraordinary comeback required. Mullin tried in the opening holes, matching Baker's early pace, but couldn't find the spark needed. By contrast, Baker's commanding 13-point middle stretch effectively locked the door, allowing him to cruise home despite Meller's barnstorming 15-point finish on the final six holes.

In the secondary Gross competition, Mullin secured his second consecutive Green Jacket with a fine 20-gross round, underlining his class even as the Stableford title slipped beyond reach.

### How It Unfolded

Baker's opening six holes set the tone for a professional's finish. His 11 points weren't spectacular—Mullin and Gregg Williams both posted 12—but they were enough. The challenger needed fireworks; Baker needed only solid golf. That measured approach revealed a player thinking tournament, not round.

The middle six holes delivered the knockout sequence. While Mullin matched him point-for-point through the front nine, Baker found another gear at the turn. His 13-point surge through holes 7-12 represented the round's best middle stretch, extending an already imposing lead while Mullin could only muster 12. Williams, starting 28 points back and needing miracles, stumbled to just 8 points through this crucial stretch, effectively ending any mathematical hope.

The final six holes produced the round's most compelling subplot, though not from the expected source. With Baker coasting toward victory on 12 points, it was Henry Meller who lit up the closing stretch. His explosive 15-point finish—three points better than anyone else—showcased what might have been had he found this form earlier. The surge lifted him past Williams into fourth, a small consolation for a tournament where he'd hovered too far back to truly challenge. Mullin's 11-point close confirmed what the middle stretch had already revealed: Baker's lead was unassailable, and the battle was over.

### Standings After Round 4

### Final Tournament Summary

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire triumph represents a masterclass in consistent excellence. Never relinquishing the lead he established in Round 1, Baker posted four rounds of quality scoring—36, 47, 45, and 36 points—to claim the TEG Trophy by a commanding 17-point margin. His ability to control the tournament through measured aggression, particularly his dominant middle rounds, left challengers chasing shadows rather than mounting genuine threats.

David Mullin's runner-up finish, while distant in Stableford points, came with the consolation of his second consecutive Green Jacket. His 20-gross final round underscored superior ball-striking even when the Stableford format didn't reward it fully. The battle for third through fifth proved the tournament's tightest margin, with just three points separating Gregg Williams (138), Henry Meller (137), and Stuart Neumann (135). Meller's spectacular closing six holes—15 points when it mattered for pride if not position—provided the final round's most thrilling individual performance.

### Round Highlights

- Baker's commanding 13-point middle stretch (holes 7-12) effectively seals the tournament
- Meller's explosive 15-point closing surge on holes 13-18—best final six of the day by three points
- Mullin's 20-gross round secures second consecutive Green Jacket despite Stableford deficit
- Hole 17 (par-4) proves the day's toughest examination, averaging 3.0 over par
- All five players maintain starting positions throughout—a testament to Baker's established dominance
