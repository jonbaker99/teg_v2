# TEG 14 - Round 3 Report

## Mullin's Back Nine Blitz Extends Lead as Williams Finds Form

**Prince's Golf Club (Shore/Dunes) • 06/11/2021 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin arrived at Prince's sitting atop the leaderboard but knowing Alex Baker lurked just eight points behind. What followed was a tale of two nines: a front side struggle that saw Mullin managing just 13 points, then an explosive closing stretch that put one hand firmly on the TEG Trophy. His 23-point back nine—capped by a barnstorming 17 points across the final six holes—extended his advantage to eight points with one round remaining.

Gregg Williams claimed the round honours with 39 points, his 12-point improvement from Round 2 breathing life into his campaign. Baker posted a steady 37 points to hold second place, whilst Jon Baker's 28-point effort kept him in fourth but saw the gap to the leaders widen further. No positions changed, but the gaps tell the real story heading into the final round.

### How It Unfolded

The Shore/Dunes combination showed its teeth early, with the opening hole averaging 1.75 over par and yielding just 1.5 points per player. Baker seized the initiative with 12 points through the first six holes, whilst Mullin—perhaps feeling the pressure of defending his lead—managed only 11. Williams posted a solid 13-point opening, but Jon Baker's eight-point start left him with ground to make up.

The middle section proved pivotal. The par-4 7th emerged as a danger zone, averaging two over par and becoming one of the day's toughest tests. Alex Baker navigated this stretch brilliantly, posting the field's best 14 points from holes seven through twelve. Williams added a steady 12, whilst Jon Baker's 10-point contribution kept him ticking along. Mullin, however, continued to struggle, mustering just eight points and watching his lead shrink as doubts crept in.

Then came the transformation. The par-5 15th—the day's easiest hole at an average of par—opened the floodgates for Mullin. He poured in 17 points across the final six holes, a stunning surge that left the rest of the field in his wake. Williams matched the intensity with 14 points of his own to seal the round win, whilst Baker's 11-point finish couldn't keep pace with the leaders' acceleration. The par-4 13th had earlier wreaked havoc, averaging 2.25 over par, but Mullin's closing blitz rendered earlier struggles irrelevant. By the 18th green, his eight-point cushion felt more like a chasm.

**Tournament Gross:** DM +75 | AB +84 | GW +97 | JB +117

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:** David Mullin needs just one point in the final round to maintain his current 1-point-per-round pace—a target so modest it borders on formality. Even a complete disaster would require something extraordinary from his challengers. Alex Baker, eight points adrift, needs 9 points per round to catch Mullin, meaning a 17-point swing is required. Possible? Yes. Probable? The mathematics say no.

The real battle has shifted to third place. Gregg Williams sits 18 points behind Mullin but just 10 ahead of Jon Baker. Williams needs an implausible 19 points per round to win, but his Round 3 resurgence (39 points) proves he's capable of explosive scoring. Baker, 31 points back, would need 32 points per round—essentially requiring multiple players to implode whilst posting his best round of the tournament.

In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's +75 gross gives him a comfortable nine-stroke cushion over Alex Baker. Unless wheels come completely off, the Jacket follows the Trophy. The final round becomes about pride, position, and whether anyone can produce the fireworks needed to make Mullin sweat.

### Round Highlights

- David Mullin's 23-point back nine, including 17 points in the final six holes—the tournament's most dominant closing stretch
- Gregg Williams' 39-point round, a 12-point improvement from Round 2 that won him the day
- The par-4 13th averaging 2.25 over par, emerging as the round's most punishing test
- Alex Baker's 14-point middle six (holes 7-12), the field's best performance through the toughest stretch
- The par-5 15th providing crucial birdie opportunities at an average of par—the day's lone scoring haven

### Player Summaries

**David Mullin:** Posted 36 points in a round of two halves—struggled to 13 on the front nine before a dominant 23-point back nine extended his lead to eight. Leads both Trophy (117 pts) and Jacket (+75) with one round remaining.

**Alex Baker:** Steady 37 points kept him in second place (109 total, -8) with consistent scoring across both nines. Needs a 17-point swing in the final round to catch Mullin—mathematically possible but statistically improbable.

**Gregg Williams:** Claimed round honours with 39 points, his 12-point improvement from Round 2 the tournament's biggest single-round jump. Sits third (99 pts, -18) but 18 points behind with realistic mathematical hopes fading.

**Jon Baker:** Managed 28 points with metronomic consistency across his six-hole segments (8-10-10). Remains fourth (86 pts, -31) but the 31-point gap makes victory virtually impossible without unprecedented drama ahead.
