# TEG 4 - Round 3 Report

## Baker Seizes Lead in Three-Way Battle at Crowborough
**Crowborough • 31/08/2011 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

With one round remaining and everything to play for, Jon Baker produced a masterful 39-point performance to snatch the TEG Trophy lead in a dramatic third round at Crowborough. Starting two points off the pace in third, Baker dominated the front nine with 22 points and survived three lead changes to edge one point clear of David Mullin heading into tomorrow's finale.

The day belonged to Baker, but the story was equally about who faltered. Joint overnight leader Henry Meller suffered a catastrophic collapse, plummeting 13 points from his previous round to post just 23 points and tumble from contention. Mullin fought valiantly with 37 points but couldn't quite match Baker's brilliance, while Stuart Neumann's steady 32 points lifted him to third. In the Green Jacket competition, Mullin extended his advantage to 14 strokes over Baker with a solid 88 gross.

Crowborough showed its teeth late, with the par-4 15th and 18th proving absolute nightmares—both averaging seven strokes, three over par. Baker's victory was forged on the front nine; his ability to hold on through the carnage secured his position at the summit.

### How It Unfolded

Baker wasted no time announcing his intentions, storming through the opening six holes with 15 points to immediately pressure the joint leaders. By the par-4 second, he'd already seized the lead from Mullin at 68 points total—the first blood drawn in what would become a three-way knife fight.

The battle intensified through the middle stretch. Baker's dominance continued from the 7th through 9th, piling up 14 points in the second six holes to build breathing room. But Mullin refused to buckle, matching that 14-point surge to stay within striking distance. At the par-3 10th, Mullin pounced, briefly reclaiming the lead at 85 points total—the second lead change of a breathless afternoon.

Baker's response was immediate and emphatic. At the very next hole, he snatched the lead back at 88 points total in what proved to be the decisive third and final lead change. Meanwhile, the day's most shocking subplot unfolded behind them: Meller's tournament disintegrated on the back nine. After matching the leaders with 11 points on the front, he managed just seven in the second six and a pitiful five in the closing stretch—a stunning collapse that ended his title hopes.

The closing holes brought fresh drama as Crowborough bared its fangs. The par-4 15th played like a monster, averaging seven strokes and yielding a miserly 0.4 points. The 18th proved equally treacherous. Mullin closed strongest with 12 points in the final six, and Gregg Williams—who'd recovered from a disastrous four-point start through the first six—matched that finish. But Baker's 10-point close was just enough. By the time the dust settled, he stood alone at the summit: 102 points, one clear, with everything to play for tomorrow.

### What's At Stake

With one round remaining, the TEG Trophy has tightened to a razor's edge. Baker's one-point cushion over Mullin is the definition of vulnerable—a single hole could swing everything tomorrow. Both players have shown they can post big numbers (Baker 39 today, Mullin 37), making this essentially a winner-takes-all shootout.

The mathematics are straightforward: Baker needs only to match Mullin point-for-point to secure his first TEG Trophy. Mullin must outscore Baker by at least two points to claim victory. Given Baker averaged 34 points through the first two rounds before today's 39, and Mullin has been rock-solid at 32-33-37, tomorrow could go either way.

Behind them, the race for third has opened up dramatically following Meller's collapse. Neumann sits one point clear of the Meller-Williams logjam at 87. With gaps of 13-15 points to the leaders, none of these three can realistically challenge for the trophy, but pride and position remain at stake. The wooden spoon appears destined for the basement, with Williams and Meller needing catastrophic final rounds to avoid that indignity.

In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's 14-stroke advantage over Baker looks commanding, though not insurmountable. Baker would need to find roughly 15 strokes tomorrow—possible but requiring both brilliance and Mullin's collapse.

### Round Highlights
- Baker's blistering 22-point front nine laid the foundation for victory
- Three lead changes between Baker and Mullin created edge-of-seat drama
- Meller's devastating collapse: 23 points after posting 36 in Round 2
- The par-4 15th and 18th both averaged seven strokes—absolute carnage
- Williams recovered from a four-point disaster through the first six holes
