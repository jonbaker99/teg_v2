# TEG 10 - Round 4 Report

## Baker Crowns Brilliant Week with Championship-Clinching Performance
**Boavista • 03/10/2017 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Alex Baker came into the final round tied for the lead with Gregg Williams, knowing the TEG Trophy was within reach. What unfolded was a masterclass in finishing, as Baker demolished the field with a stunning 51-point performance that turned a shared lead into an 11-point championship victory. The battle for the crown was effectively decided in the opening six holes, where Baker's explosive 17-point burst established a commanding advantage that Williams—despite a solid 40-point round—could never threaten. By day's end, Baker had claimed both the round win and the TEG Trophy with 184 points total, while Williams held on for second at 173. In the Green Jacket competition, David Mullin secured the gross scoring title to add another dimension to the final leaderboard.

### How It Unfolded

The championship was won before lunchtime. Baker's opening salvo produced 17 points across the first six holes, a blistering pace that immediately put pressure on joint overnight leader Williams. While Williams posted a respectable 13 points over the same stretch, he found himself chasing from the moment Baker hit his stride. Jon Baker and David Mullin both matched Williams's 13-14 point opening, but they too were watching the leader disappear into the distance.

The middle six holes showcased why Baker was in command. Producing 19 points through what proved to be the toughest stretch of the course—including the brutal par-5 8th that averaged 7.33 strokes and yielded just 1.67 Stableford points per player—Baker's excellence was relentless. His 27-point front nine had effectively sealed the championship. Williams fought back with a strong 15 points in the second six, but the gap was insurmountable. Stuart Neumann found some rhythm with 14 points, while John Patterson's struggles began to show in earnest.

The final six holes became a procession for Baker, who cruised home with 15 points and a 24-point back nine to complete his 51-point masterpiece. Jon Baker finished strongest among the chasers with 16 points in the closing stretch, including taking advantage of the day's easiest hole at the par-5 16th, which averaged 5.33 strokes and offered three Stableford points on average. The par-4 18th—the second-hardest hole of the day at 6.17 strokes average—tested everyone's closing nerves, but Baker had long since wrapped up the title. Williams's solid 40 points was ultimately nine points short of Baker's best on the day, while Mullin's 40-point round secured him third place overall and the Green Jacket for gross scoring.

### Championship Decided

**The final round delivered a clear verdict.**

Alex Baker entered tied for the lead and needed to match or better Gregg Williams's performance. Instead, he produced the tournament's best single-round score by four points, turning a shared lead into a comprehensive 11-point victory. Baker's 51 points represented a four-point improvement on his Round 3 co-leading 47, demonstrating the ability to peak when it mattered most. Williams's 40 points—seven points below his Round 3 pace—was solid in isolation but never threatened once Baker exploded from the opening holes.

The battle for third place was decided by David Mullin's impressive nine-point improvement from Round 3, his 40-point effort keeping him 22 points behind Baker but securing the Green Jacket for best gross score. Jon Baker's strong finish—particularly his 16-point closing six holes—earned him fourth place at 157 points, while Stuart Neumann's back-nine surge (21 points) kept him clear in fifth. John Patterson's disappointing 21-point round, a six-point decline from his Round 3 performance, left him 72 points adrift in last place.

The championship was effectively won with Baker's opening brilliance. His 17-point start in the first six holes—combined with Williams's solid but unremarkable 13 points—created a gap that proved insurmountable even with 12 holes remaining.
