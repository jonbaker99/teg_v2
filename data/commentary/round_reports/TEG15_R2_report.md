# TEG 15 - Round 2 Report

## Williams Withstands Early Challenge to Seize Control at West Cliffs
**West Cliffs • 16/10/2022 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams arrived at West Cliffs with a slender two-point cushion, knowing the tournament's notorious difficulty could evaporate his advantage in a heartbeat. By the time he'd navigated eighteen holes of high drama, he'd not only survived—he'd thrived, posting a magnificent 40-point haul to extend his lead to a commanding nine points over John Patterson.

The round delivered everything a midpoint battle should: an early lead change that sent ripples through the field, a brutal par-5 6th that averaged nearly four strokes over par, and a stunning eagle from David Mullin at the 15th that propelled him from the pack into genuine contention. Patterson briefly seized the lead at the 3rd, only to watch Williams snatch it back a hole later and never look back. Meanwhile, the Green Jacket battle intensified as Williams's gross 16 edged further ahead, though Mullin's explosive 22 kept things interesting.

With two rounds remaining at this unforgiving track, Williams has breathing room but not safety. Behind him, Patterson holds firm in second while Mullin's late surge has injected fresh uncertainty into what's shaping as a fascinating final-day showdown.

### How It Unfolded

Williams began like a man possessed, collecting 12 points through the opening six holes while most of the field grappled with West Cliffs's early defences. Alex Baker matched that pace, but crucially, Patterson found his rhythm too—and at the short par-3 3rd, he edged ahead on the leaderboard for the first time all tournament.

The lead lasted precisely one hole. Williams responded immediately at the 4th, reclaiming top spot with authority and settling into the kind of relentless consistency that would define his round. Twenty points on the front nine, twenty on the back—a symmetry that spoke of complete control even as chaos erupted around him.

The par-5 6th proved the tournament's most brutal examination yet, averaging 8.83 strokes against a par of five. Players limped away from the green having surrendered shots by the handful, but Williams navigated the carnage and pressed on, adding another 16 points through the middle six holes—the round's highest split for that stretch.

Then came the fireworks. David Mullin, who'd been simmering at 11 points through the middle section, exploded into life on the back nine. His eagle at the par-5 15th—a glorious three that lit up the leaderboard—headlined a stunning 20-point back nine that vaulted him from tied-5th to outright 3rd. He wasn't the only one charging; Patterson piled on 14 points over the closing stretch, applying what pressure he could to the distant leader.

But for every surge, West Cliffs demanded payment. Stuart Neumann, who'd started the round in a share of 3rd place, hemorrhaged shots down the stretch, managing just six points over the final six holes. His collapse included a position-shedding disaster at the 14th, and the brutal par-4 17th—averaging 7.5 strokes—added to the carnage. Jon Baker also stumbled early with just five points through six holes before staging a recovery that salvaged respectability if not position.

Williams, meanwhile, kept his foot down, adding 12 final-stretch points to seal a performance that announced him as the man to beat—though with two rounds and this course's venomous bite still to come, nothing's decided yet.

### What's At Stake

With two rounds remaining at one of golf's most punishing examinations, Gregg Williams's nine-point cushion is substantial but far from insurmountable. History suggests 36-40 points per round is achievable here, meaning Patterson needs to average around 35 points over the final two days while hoping Williams drops to 30 or below—demanding but possible given West Cliffs's capacity for carnage.

The real intrigue lies in the chasing pack. David Mullin, now just seven points off Patterson and 16 back of Williams, has momentum and demonstrated he can go low with that eagle-fuelled back nine surge. He needs near-perfect golf—around 38 points per round—to threaten the lead, but his trajectory suggests he's hitting form at precisely the right moment. Jon Baker and the Alex Baker-Stuart Neumann tie for 5th remain mathematically alive, though they'd need Williams to implode while posting consecutive 35-plus rounds themselves.

The Green Jacket battle provides an alternate narrative. Williams's 19-stroke advantage over Mullin in gross scoring is commanding, but not conclusive. Mullin's cleaner ball-striking gives him hope, while Patterson's 32-stroke deficit makes his path significantly steeper. For the leaders, protecting means avoiding the disasters that lurk at holes like the 6th and 17th—easier said than survived.

### Round Highlights
- Eagle at the 15th for David Mullin propels dramatic late surge
- Lead changes hands twice in opening four holes between Williams and Patterson
- Par-5 6th averages 8.83 strokes—tournament's most destructive hole
- Williams posts perfect 20-20 front-to-back split for 40-point masterclass
- Stuart Neumann's final-six collapse: six points and three-position plummet

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Forty points of controlled excellence—20 on each nine—extends his TEG Trophy lead to nine points while his gross 16 strengthens his Green Jacket advantage. Absorbed Patterson's early challenge and never blinked.

**John Patterson:** Briefly held the lead at the 3rd before Williams responded, then fought back with a strong 14-point finish to hold second place. Nine points back with two rounds to play—close enough to dream, far enough to worry.

**David Mullin:** The round's most explosive performance: struggled early, caught fire late, and that eagle at the 15th crowned a 20-point back nine that rocketed him from tied-5th to outright 3rd. Now just 16 off the lead.

**Jon Baker:** Survived a nightmarish start—just five points through six holes—to recover with 19 back-nine points, but the early damage saw him slip from 3rd to 4th. Three points clear of the battle for 5th.

**Alex Baker:** Blazing 12-point start evaporated into an eight-point middle section and seven-point finish. Holds 5th but momentum has stalled badly when he needs to be pressing forward.

**Stuart Neumann:** Started in a share of 3rd, finished in a share of 5th after a brutal final stretch. Just six points over the closing six holes, including a three-position drop at the 14th, leaves him 22 points adrift and running out of road.
