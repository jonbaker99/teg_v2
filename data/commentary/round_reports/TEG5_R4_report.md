# TEG 5 - Round 4 Report

# Baker's Brilliant Finale Secures Trophy Glory

**Palmares - Lagos / Praia • 06/06/2012 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker produced a stunning final-round 42 points to snatch the TEG Trophy from overnight leader Gregg Williams in a pulsating finale at Palmares. Starting the day one point behind, Baker bookended his round with explosive scoring bursts—16 points through the opening six holes, then another 16 through the closing stretch—to claim victory by three points with a tournament total of 156.

The lead changed hands five times across a dramatic afternoon, with Williams and Baker trading blows until the par-4 14th, where Baker seized control for the final time. Henry Meller produced the day's best gross score (17 over) to surge two positions into a share of third place, while Williams' valiant 38-point effort fell agonisingly short of defending his position. In the secondary Green Jacket competition, Baker's consistent ball-striking throughout the week secured him a double triumph.

### How It Unfolded

Baker announced his intentions immediately, racing to 16 points through the opening six holes while Williams could manage only 14. The lead changed hands at the par-3 third when Baker briefly edged ahead, but Williams struck back at the fifth to reclaim top spot. At the sixth, Baker retook the lead as Meller—quietly accumulating 15 points of his own—suddenly surged into contention, leaping two positions in the standings.

The middle six holes became a war of attrition. All five players remarkably scored exactly 10 points through this stretch, with the brutal par-5 11th—averaging 7.2 strokes, a massive 2.2 over par—proving the day's sternest test. Players averaged just one Stableford point there, with disasters scattered across the leaderboard. Relief came at the following par-3 12th, the easiest hole of the day at just 0.2 over par. Williams managed to reclaim the lead at the eighth, but the stalemate through the middle holes meant everything would be decided on the run home.

**The Decisive Stretch**

The championship was won and lost between the 13th and 18th. Baker unleashed another 16-point assault over the closing six, with the par-4 14th providing the knockout blow—his fifth and final lead change of the day. Williams fought back with 12 points, while Meller and Neumann both posted 14-point finishes, but none could match Baker's relentless scoring. Neumann's late rally—recovering from a disastrous eight-point opening six—came too late to salvage his position, while David Mullin's tournament unravelled completely. Despite a strong 19-point back nine, his seven-point start through the opening holes dropped him to fifth and out of contention for the Spoon battle.

### Standings After Round 4

**Round 4 Stableford:** JB 42 | HM 39 | GW 38 | SN 32 | DM 30  
**Round 4 Gross:** HM +17 | JB +18 | DM +22 | SN +24 | GW +32

**Final Stableford (TEG Trophy):** JB 156 | GW 153 | HM 139 | SN 139 | DM 136  
**Final Gross (Green Jacket):** JB +67 | GW +89 | DM +99 | HM +103 | SN +106

### Tournament Complete

**TEG Trophy Champion: Jon Baker (156 points)**

Baker's victory came down to his superior consistency in the clutch moments across all four rounds. His tournament total of 156 points included three rounds of 38 points or better, with today's 42-point masterclass the decisive blow. Williams finishes three points adrift on 153—so close yet so far—while the battle for third went to a tie between Meller and Neumann on 139 points.

The three-point winning margin tells only part of the story. Baker's ability to produce explosive scoring bursts when it mattered most—both at the tournament's beginning and end—separated him from a determined field. His 16-point opening six today erased Williams' overnight advantage, while his 16-point closing six slammed the door on any comeback hopes.

**Green Jacket Champion: Jon Baker (+67 gross)**

Baker completed the double by claiming the secondary Green Jacket competition with a four-round gross total of 67 over par, finishing 22 strokes clear of Williams. His superior ball-striking throughout the week—evidenced by today's 18-over-par gross score in challenging conditions—gave him an insurmountable advantage in the gross standings. Meller's tournament-best 17-over gross round today wasn't enough to threaten Baker's commanding position.

### Round Highlights

- Five lead changes between Baker and Williams created non-stop drama
- Baker's explosive 16-point bookends (holes 1-6 and 13-18) delivered the title
- The par-5 11th averaged 7.2 strokes—a brutal 2.2 over par that tested everyone
- Meller's two-position surge (5th to T3) powered by best gross round of the day
- Williams' heartbreak: leading with six holes to play, falling three short

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Champion's performance when it mattered most—42 points featuring two 16-point surges sealed both Trophy and Jacket victories. His tournament total of 156 points and +67 gross proved unbeatable across four rounds of consistent excellence.

**Gregg Williams:** Heartbreaking runner-up finish after leading for much of the tournament. His 38-point final round and strong 22-point front nine couldn't withstand Baker's closing charge. Finished three points short of defending his position.

**Henry Meller:** Tournament's biggest mover with a superb 39-point finale (best gross of the day at +17) to surge from 5th to T3. His consistent 15-10-14 split across the three sixes showcased admirable composure under pressure.

**Stuart Neumann:** Rallied late with 14-point finish but his disastrous eight-point opening six cost him dearly. Shares third place on 139 points but will rue missed opportunities early in the round.

**David Mullin:** Disappointing conclusion with only 30 points, falling from 4th to 5th. His seven-point opening six proved insurmountable despite a competitive 19-point back nine that showed what might have been.
