## Round Report

# Williams Wins the Round, But Meller Cruises Toward Glory

**Royal Óbidos • 04/10/2014 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Henry Meller entered the day with a slender four-point lead and left it with a commanding 12-point cushion, despite being outscored by Gregg Williams's brilliant 41-point performance. The leader didn't need fireworks—his steady 37 points were more than enough as challengers faltered on a demanding Royal Óbidos layout that punished mistakes ruthlessly.

Williams claimed round honors with a spectacular middle-six stretch worth 19 points, but the day's most significant movement came from David Mullin, who rocketed from fourth to second with 39 points built on an explosive opening six holes. Jon Baker's title hopes suffered a potentially fatal blow with a wretched start that saw him drop from second to third, while Stuart Neumann's mid-round collapse sent him tumbling two places to fifth.

With just one round remaining, Meller stands on the precipice of TEG Trophy glory, needing only steady golf to fend off a chasing pack that's running out of ammunition.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker's challenge unraveled before it properly began. Just three holes into the round, the overnight second-placed player had already surrendered two positions, managing only eight points across the opening six—the worst start in the field. While Baker struggled, David Mullin was finding something special, torching the front nine with 16 points that immediately signaled his intent to chase down Meller.

The middle stretch belonged entirely to Gregg Williams. Between holes seven and twelve, the fifth-placed player produced the tournament's best six-hole sequence, racking up 19 points in a purple patch that would ultimately deliver him round honors. But while Williams climbed to fourth, it was Stuart Neumann who suffered the day's most dramatic reversal. After opening with a respectable 13 points, Neumann's wheels came off spectacularly through the middle six, collecting just eight points as he plummeted from third to fifth.

By hole ten, the leaderboard had been thoroughly shuffled. Baker had dropped four positions from his starting spot, while Neumann gained two places before his subsequent collapse. Mullin's sustained excellence—14 points through the middle stretch to complement his blazing start—carried him into second place, but Meller's relentless consistency kept him comfortably clear at the summit.

The closing stretch proved treacherous for everyone. The par-4 12th had already emerged as the round's hardest hole, averaging 2.33 over par, but the par-5 18th proved equally vicious, claiming an identical 2.33 over par from the field. Alex Baker navigated the finish best with 13 points, while Williams faded to just eight—though his round was already won. Mullin, Meller, and Neumann all limped home with nine points apiece, but with one round remaining, only Meller could afford such struggles.

### Standings After Round 3

**Round 3 Stableford:** GW 41 | DM 39 | HM 37 | AB 36 | JB 33 | SN 33  
**Round 3 Gross:** GW +28 | DM +30 | HM +32 | AB +33 | JB +36 | SN +36

**Tournament Stableford:** HM 137 | DM 125 | JB 123 | GW 122 | SN 121 | AB 114  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +90 | HM +96 | GW +107 | JB +109 | SN +109 | AB +123

### What's At Stake

**With 1 round remaining:**

Henry Meller needs only to show up. His 12-point cushion over David Mullin means the challenger would need to win the final round by at least 13 points while Meller suffers a complete collapse—virtually impossible given Meller's consistency. Even Mullin's explosive 39-point performance today couldn't make serious inroads into the leader's advantage. For Meller, averaging just 25 points would likely seal the TEG Trophy even if Mullin produces another stellar round.

Behind them, a fascinating battle rages for the remaining positions. Just four points separate second through fifth—Mullin (125), Baker (123), Williams (122), and Neumann (121). Williams demonstrated today that 41-point rounds are within reach, meaning any of these four could finish anywhere from second to fifth. Jon Baker needs to rediscover his opening-round form (42 points) to mount a final-day charge, while Neumann must shake off today's middle-six horror show.

The race for last place, meanwhile, is all but decided. Alex Baker trails Stuart Neumann by seven points with one round to play—a catchable gap, but requiring the kind of performance that's eluded him all tournament while Neumann implodes.

### Round Highlights

- Gregg Williams's middle-six masterclass: 19 points across holes 7-12, the tournament's best six-hole stretch
- David Mullin's explosive opening: 16 points through the first six holes announces his second-place charge
- Jon Baker's disastrous start: Eight points through the opening stretch derails his title challenge
- Stuart Neumann's mid-round collapse: Just eight points between holes 7-12 sends him tumbling down the leaderboard
- The brutal closing stretch: Holes 12 and 18 both averaging 2.33 over par punish the entire field

### Player Summaries

**Henry MELLER:** Steady 37 points maintained his commanding lead despite being outscored by Williams; now 12 points clear with one round remaining and firmly in control of the TEG Trophy.

**David MULLIN:** Explosive 39 points powered by blazing 16-point opening six vaulted him from fourth to second; now 12 behind Meller but clear of the chasing pack.

**Jon BAKER:** Poor 33 points built on wretched eight-point start cost him dearly; dropped from second to third and now 14 points off the lead with title hopes all but extinguished.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Round-winning 41 points featuring brilliant 19-point middle stretch moved him up one place to fourth; 15 points behind leader but still mathematically alive.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Disappointing 33 points marred by eight-point middle-six collapse dropped him two places to fifth; 16 points off the lead and needing something special in the finale.

**Alex BAKER:** Consistent 36 points including best closing stretch (13 points) kept him sixth; 23 points behind leader and facing probable wooden spoon unless Neumann falters badly.
