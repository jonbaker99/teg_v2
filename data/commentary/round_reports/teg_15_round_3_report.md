## Round Report

## Williams Commands as the Trophy Race Tightens
**Penha Longa • 17/10/2022 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams delivered a masterclass at Penha Longa, posting 44 Stableford points to extend his TEG Trophy lead to a commanding 18 points heading into the final round. While Stuart Neumann exploded from the gates with 16 points through six holes, Williams seized control through the middle stretch and never looked back, dominating the back nine with 25 points including a spectacular 16-point surge through the closing holes.

The day's drama centered on the battle for second place, where John Patterson held firm despite losing ground to the leader, while Jon Baker's sizzling 41-point round and David Mullin's resurgent 40 points kept the chase pack within mathematical reach. But the day belonged to Williams, whose controlled brilliance leaves him on the cusp of TEG Trophy glory.

In the Green Jacket gross competition, the gaps remain tight with multiple players still in contention for the secondary prize.

### How It Unfolded

**Early Fireworks**

Stuart Neumann had no interest in waiting around. The fifth-placed player stormed through the opening six holes with 16 Stableford points, the day's best start, immediately applying pressure to the field. David Mullin matched the intensity with 15 points, while Williams seemed almost pedestrian with just 11 points—except he was starting the day with a 14-point cushion.

The par-5 12th proved the round's graveyard. The entire field hemorrhaged strokes on what became the hardest hole of the day, averaging a shocking 7.0 against par. This was the tournament's disaster hole, playing two strokes over par, and nobody escaped unscathed.

**The Williams Show**

Any concerns about Williams were erased through the middle six holes. While Alex Baker's challenge imploded with a catastrophic six-point split through holes 7-12, Williams fired 17 points to seize complete control. Neumann kept pace with 16 points through the same stretch, but Williams was just warming up.

The closing six holes became a procession. Williams poured in 16 more points, combining for a devastating 25-point back nine that broke the field's collective will. The par-3 15th offered brief respite—the entire field parred the easiest hole of the day—but Williams had already built an insurmountable advantage. Jon Baker mounted the strongest finish with 15 points through the closing stretch, but by then Williams was already measuring for the Trophy.

### Standings After Round 3

**Round 3 Stableford:** GW 44 | SN 43 | JB 41 | DM 40 | JP 35 | AB 29  
**Round 3 Gross:** GW +10 | AB +14 | JP +14 | DM +15 | JB +17 | SN +19

**Tournament Stableford:** GW 123 | JP 105 | DM 103 | JB 101 | SN 100 | AB 86  
**Tournament Gross:** JP +54 | DM +56 | GW +63 | JB +69 | AB +71 | SN +83

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:**

Williams needs just 26 Stableford points—a perfectly mediocre round by any standard—to guarantee the TEG Trophy. Even if he posts his worst round of the week, Patterson would need a near-perfect 44-point performance to catch him. The Trophy is Williams' to lose.

The real drama lies in the battle for second through fifth. Just four points separate Patterson (105), Mullin (103), Baker (101), and Neumann (100). Patterson needs consistency to hold his runner-up spot, but any of the three players behind him could leapfrog into second place with a strong final round. A 38-point day from any chaser combined with a Patterson stumble could shuffle the podium dramatically.

The Green Jacket race remains tighter, with Patterson (+54) and Mullin (+56) separated by just two strokes gross. Williams sits seven strokes back at +63, meaning the secondary competition could still produce a different champion. A gross score around +14 should be enough for Patterson or Mullin to secure the Jacket, but both will need to hold off Williams' consistency.

Alex Baker's tournament has unraveled—37 points adrift with one round remaining—but the spoon battle is over.

### Round Highlights
- Stuart Neumann's explosive 16-point opening split, the best start of the day
- Gregg Williams' dominant 25-point back nine seizing complete control
- The par-5 12th playing as a disaster hole, averaging 7.0 strokes (two over par)
- Alex Baker's middle-six collapse, posting just six points through holes 7-12
- Jon Baker's strongest finish split at 15 points, though too late to threaten the leader

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Masterful 44-point round extends lead to 18 with just 26 points needed tomorrow to guarantee the Trophy; devastating back nine (25 points) broke the field.

**David Mullin:** Bounced back with 40 points after recent struggles but remains 20 points off the lead; steady throughout (15-13-12 splits) but Green Jacket remains realistic goal.

**Jon Baker:** Surging 41-point round keeps mathematical hopes alive at 22 points back; most consistent splits of the day (13-13-15) with strongest finish.

**Stuart Neumann:** Explosive 43-point performance wasted by Williams' brilliance; raced to 16-point opening but faded late (11 points final six), now 23 points adrift.
