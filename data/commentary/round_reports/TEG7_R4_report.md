# TEG 7 - Round 4 Report

## Meller Holds Nerve as Williams and Neumann Light Up Praia D'El Rey
**Praia D'El Rey • 05/10/2014 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Henry Meller arrived at the final round with a five-point cushion and a simple task: don't collapse. What unfolded was a masterclass in tournament management as Meller posted a steady 38 points to claim the TEG Trophy by five, holding his position throughout a round where others delivered fireworks. Gregg Williams and Stuart Neumann both exploded for tournament-best 48-point rounds, but their late surges came too late to catch the leader. Williams's sensational effort vaulted him from fourth to a tie for second alongside David Mullin, while Neumann's 48-point masterpiece—built on an incredible 25-point back nine—elevated him to fourth. The drama was limited at the top, but Praia D'El Rey's teeth were bared: the opening hole and the par-5 10th both played two over par average, setting a brutal tone that only the day's two stars could truly conquer.

### How It Unfolded

Praia D'El Rey announced its intentions immediately. The opening hole, the tournament's hardest, played to an average of two over par and left the entire field scrambling. Meller absorbed the punch, staying composed while Williams began building something special with 17 points through the opening six holes. Jon Baker looked dangerous early with 15 points through six, but the wheels would come off spectacularly.

The middle stretch belonged to carnage and brilliance in equal measure. The par-5 10th became a graveyard—eight scoring events registered as the hole played two over par average, matching the opener as the day's hardest test. Baker's round imploded here, managing just 10 points across holes 7-12 as his title hopes evaporated. Williams, meanwhile, refused to blink, adding another 17 points to reach 34 through twelve. Neumann quietly gathered momentum with 17 of his own, setting up a spectacular finish.

The par-5 17th finally offered relief, playing to just 0.33 over par and delivering an average of 3.67 Stableford points. Williams made his move here, but the two-position jump came too late to threaten Meller's wire-to-wire march. Neumann saved his best for last, torching the back nine for 25 points—a back-nine performance for the ages—but even 48 points for the round couldn't overcome the deficit. Meller simply refused to crack, posting 13 points over the final six holes to seal the Trophy. David Mullin's metronomic consistency—15 points in each six-hole segment—earned him a share of second, while Baker's middle-round meltdown (15-10-16 splits) saw him tumble two spots to fifth.

### What's At Stake

Tournament complete. Henry Meller claims the TEG Trophy with 175 points, his wire-to-wire performance never genuinely threatened despite modest scoring in the final round. The five-point margin tells the story of a player who understood exactly what the tournament required: steady accumulation over four rounds rather than spectacular brilliance in one. Williams and Neumann's remarkable final rounds showcased what might have been—had either found this form earlier, the outcome could have been dramatically different. The Trophy and Green Jacket split as expected, with David Mullin's consistency in gross scoring (105 strokes, 15 ahead of Williams) earning him the secondary competition despite finishing level on Stableford points for second place. Jon Baker's collapse from third to fifth serves as the cautionary tale: in Stableford, one bad stretch can undo an entire tournament's work.

### Round Highlights
- Gregg Williams and Stuart Neumann both fire tournament-best 48 points, but too late to catch leader
- The par-5 10th becomes a disaster zone, playing two over par average with eight scoring events
- Neumann's back nine for the ages: 25 Stableford points
- Henry Meller's nerveless 38 points secures wire-to-wire Trophy victory
- Jon Baker's middle-six implosion (10 points) drops him from third to fifth

### Player Summaries

**Henry Meller:** A 38-point final round won't make highlight reels, but tournament management perfection does. Held his lead throughout, never panicking despite fireworks elsewhere, claiming the Trophy with 175 points and a wire-to-wire performance.

**David Mullin:** Metronomic consistency (15-15-15 splits) delivered 45 points and a tie for second in the Trophy race. Claims the Green Jacket with 105 gross strokes, 15 ahead of Williams—proof that steady pays.

**Gregg Williams:** A tournament-best 48 points vaulted him from fourth to share second, but the hot start (17-17-14 splits) came a round too late. Runner-up in the Green Jacket as well (+127), leaving him to rue earlier inconsistency.

**Stuart Neumann:** Saved the best for last with 48 points built on an extraordinary 25-point back nine. The massive improvement (from 33 previous best) elevated him to fourth, but like Williams, the brilliance arrived too late.

**Jon Baker:** A promising start (15 points through six) gave way to middle-round disaster (just 10 points holes 7-12). The 41-point total couldn't prevent a two-spot drop to fifth, ending what had been a solid tournament week.

**Alex Baker:** Rallied from a slow start (nine points first six) to finish respectably (14-15 splits), posting 38 points. Remained sixth throughout, never threatening the leaders but showing resilience on a tough final day.
