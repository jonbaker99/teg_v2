# TEG 11 - Round 4 Report

## Brothers' Battle Decided: Jon Baker Claims Trophy Glory

**PGA Catalunya - Stadium • 07/10/2018 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

After three rounds of trading blows, the Baker brothers' epic duel for the TEG Trophy came down to a final showdown on the Stadium Course. Jon Baker entered the round one point behind older brother Alex, with three other contenders lurking within striking distance. The stage was set for drama—and the brothers delivered.

John Patterson seized the round honours with a spectacular 36 points, riding a tournament-best opening split of 16 points through the first six holes. But the day belonged to Jon Baker, who produced a commanding middle-section surge to overtake his brother at the par-4 7th and never looked back. His 35-point final round—anchored by a dominant 16-point split from holes 7-12—was enough to claim the TEG Trophy by six points. Alex Baker's uncharacteristic 27-point struggle, featuring a disastrous 10-point opening, ended his title defence before he could mount a challenge.

In the Green Jacket race, David Mullin's consistent gross play secured the secondary competition, adding another dimension to the final-round drama on Catalunya's unforgiving layout.

### How It Unfolded

The round exploded into life immediately as John Patterson caught fire through the opening six holes. His blistering 16-point split—the best opening performance of the entire tournament—sent shockwaves through the field and briefly thrust him into contention. David Mullin matched the early fireworks with 14 points of his own, scorching the front stretch to stay in touch with the leaders.

But the front-nine pyrotechnics masked a critical development: Alex Baker was hemorrhaging points. The overnight leader managed just 10 points through the opening six, the worst split of any contender, and suddenly his seemingly comfortable position looked vulnerable. Brother Jon, playing with characteristic steadiness, carded 12 points to stay within striking distance.

**The Turning Point**

Everything changed at the par-4 7th. Jon Baker seized control with a dominant middle-section performance that would ultimately decide the tournament. His 16-point split from holes 7-12 was the best middle-section performance of the day, and it gave him the lead for the first time. The momentum shift was complete: Patterson's brilliant start evaporated into a seven-point collapse through the same stretch, while Alex Baker could only muster nine points—never finding the spark needed to respond to his brother's surge.

By the time the field reached the treacherous par-4 13th—the day's hardest hole at 2.4 shots over par—Jon Baker had built enough cushion to withstand the closing pressure. His seven-point finish wasn't spectacular, but it didn't need to be. Patterson roared back with 13 points on the closing stretch to claim round honours, while Gregg Williams' solid 12-point finish secured third place overall. But Jon Baker held firm, the Trophy his by six clear points as brothers' bragging rights were decided for another year.

### What's At Stake

**The Final Reckoning**

With the tournament concluded, the numbers tell the story of a title decided by consistency over flash. Jon Baker's victory margin of six points reflected his ability to deliver when it mattered most—his 35-point finale the perfect counterpoint to Alex's 27-point fade. The brothers finished 1-2 for the second consecutive TEG, but this time the younger Baker claimed the silverware.

Gregg Williams' third-place finish, just one point behind Alex and seven behind the winner, represented a solid tournament but highlighted the fine margins at the top. His consistent scoring—never brilliant, never disastrous—left him tantalizingly close to glory. John Patterson's fourth-place finish, eight points off the pace, showcased both the brilliance (his 16-point opening split, 39 points in Round 3) and the volatility (that seven-point middle section) that ultimately cost him. David Mullin's fifth-place finish, 18 points adrift, was redeemed by his Green Jacket triumph in the gross competition—proof that multiple paths to victory exist in TEG competition.

The Spoon battle never materialized, with the field too tightly packed for anyone to claim the unwanted wooden award.

### Round Highlights

- **Patterson's Hot Start:** Tournament-best 16-point opening split through holes 1-6 briefly threatened to turn the leaderboard upside down
- **The Baker Takeover:** Jon's commanding 16-point middle section (H7-12) seized control at the perfect moment
- **Patterson's Collapse:** Seven-point middle stretch undid his brilliant opening and ended his title hopes
- **Alex's Silent Struggle:** The overnight leader's 10-point opening never gave him a chance to defend
- **Mullin's Front-Nine Blitz:** 19 points across the opening nine, including a 14-point opening split, kept the Jacket race honest

### Player Summaries

**Jon BAKER:** His 35-point finale, highlighted by a tournament-best 16-point middle section, completed a remarkable comeback from one point down to claim the TEG Trophy by six. Held his nerve through a tense closing stretch to secure the family bragging rights.

**Alex BAKER:** A nightmare 27-point round—his worst of the tournament—featured a disastrous 10-point opening that surrendered the overnight lead. Never recovered, dropping from 1st to 2nd as the title slipped away.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Consistent 32-point effort (12-8-12 splits) secured third place, just one point behind Alex but seven shy of the winner. Solid throughout the tournament but lacked the explosive scoring needed to challenge the Bakers.

**John PATTERSON:** Claimed round honours with 36 points despite a middle-section collapse, his tournament-best 16-point opening split and 13-point finish sandwiching a seven-point meltdown. Finished fourth, eight points off the pace.

**David MULLIN:** Scorching 19-point front nine (14 pts H1-6) couldn't prevent a back-nine fade, but his 31-point round kept him in fifth. Green Jacket winner by seven strokes, proving gross excellence amidst Stableford struggles.
