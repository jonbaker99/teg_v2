# TEG 17 - Round 3 Report

## Baker Extends Command as Patterson Surges at Royal Óbidos
**Royal Óbidos • 07/10/2024 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon BAKER entered the third round with a slender lead, but Royal Óbidos would prove the stage for him to transform a tight race into a near-procession. His commanding 44-point performance—matching his own second-round effort—has opened up an 11-point cushion with just one round remaining, leaving his rivals staring at a mathematical mountain.

The round began with the field bunched closely together, but Baker's masterful back-nine surge of 33 points pulled him clear of the chasing pack. While David MULLIN's steady golf kept him in second place, it was John PATTERSON who stole the supporting role, matching Baker's closing six-hole blitz of 17 points to vault into fourth position. Alex BAKER, who looked poised to apply pressure after 27 points through twelve holes, suffered a catastrophic collapse over the final six, managing just 7 points when he could least afford it.

The par-5 5th hole lived up to its reputation as Royal Óbidos's sternest test, averaging 2.8 over par and yielding a miserly 0.6 Stableford points across the field. But it was the closing stretch where the day's true drama unfolded—or rather, where the tournament leader ensured there would be precious little drama left for the final round.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes suggested a competitive day ahead. Alex BAKER edged the early exchanges with 13 points, while Jon BAKER's 11 and David MULLIN's 12 kept them firmly in touch. Behind them, Patterson and Williams struggled to find rhythm, posting 11 and 9 respectively as the field navigated Royal Óbidos's challenging start.

Everything changed through the middle six. Jon BAKER shifted through the gears with a 16-point surge from the 7th through the 12th, seizing control of both the round and the tournament. His brother Alex kept pace with 14 points, while Patterson began his recovery with 13. Mullin, ominously, dropped to just 11 points as the leader pulled away. Even Gregg WILLIAMS found some form with 12 points, but by then Baker was already building what would prove an unassailable advantage.

**The Closing Surge**

The final six holes became a tale of two players rising and one collapsing. Jon BAKER delivered a stunning 17-point finish, turning a comfortable lead into a commanding one. Remarkably, John PATTERSON matched him stroke for stroke down the stretch, his own 17-point surge completing a 24-point back nine that catapulted him past Williams into fourth place overall.

For Alex BAKER, however, the closing holes became a horror show. After accumulating 27 points through twelve holes and looking every inch a challenger, he imploded with just 7 points over the final six—a collapse that, mercifully for him, came too late to cost him third place. Williams, managing only 5 points in the same stretch, tumbled to last place. Even Mullin's steady 12-point finish felt like defeat, as the gap to the leader yawned ever wider.

The par-5 5th had proven the day's most punishing examination, with the field averaging 2.8 over par. But it was Jon Baker's relentless accumulation through the back nine—33 points across the final twelve holes—that truly defined the round.

### What's At Stake

**With 1 round remaining:**

Jon BAKER needs only to show up. His 11-point lead over David MULLIN means even a disastrous 20-point round would leave him champion if Mullin produces another career-best performance. Barring a meltdown of historic proportions, the TEG Trophy is his to lose. In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's 8-stroke advantage gives him similar breathing room, though his cushion is slightly more vulnerable to a Baker surge.

For the challengers, the mathematics are brutal. Mullin would need Baker to implode while simultaneously posting another 47-point masterclass—the exact performance that won him Round 2. Even then, he'd only draw level. Alex BAKER, 23 points back, is clinging to mathematical hope but would need his brother to score in the teens while he himself delivers a career round north of 45 points. It's theoretically possible. Practically? The tournament is over.

The real battle is now for Green Jacket honors, where Mullin's 8-stroke lead over Jon Baker keeps genuine competition alive, and for third place, where Alex Baker holds a 12-point cushion over Patterson. The Spoon race has collapsed into a two-horse sprint between Williams and Patterson, separated by just a single point. Patterson's stunning 41-point round has transformed that battle from inevitable to intriguing.
