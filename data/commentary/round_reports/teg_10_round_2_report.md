## Round Report

## Williams Surges as Closing Holes Extract Revenge
**Palmares - Praia / Alvor • 01/10/2017 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin arrived at Palmares holding a slender lead, knowing the Portuguese coastline rarely gifts easy scoring. What unfolded was a round of two halves: brilliant golf through the opening dozen holes, followed by a back stretch that reduced grown men to despair. Gregg Williams emerged from the carnage with the day's best round—48 Stableford points—to surge into a tie for second place, while Mullin's steady 42 maintained his tournament lead despite a drop from his opening-round brilliance.

The drama played out in stark contrasts. Jon Baker lit up the opening six holes with 18 points, only to suffer a catastrophic collapse down the stretch. Williams exploded through the middle six with 20 points, the round's best split. But it was the closing stretch—particularly the par-4 14th and 18th—that proved most decisive, averaging a brutal 2.33 strokes over par and separating those who could hold their nerve from those who couldn't.

### How It Unfolded

**Opening Salvo**

Baker came out swinging. Through the opening six holes, he compiled 18 Stableford points, setting the pace while others struggled to find rhythm. The par-4 opener, playing 2.17 over par on average, set an ominous tone, but Baker navigated the early challenges with precision. Alex Baker matched his brother's intensity with 17 points through the same stretch, while Mullin's steadier 15 kept him within range of the early leaders.

Williams, meanwhile, was biding his time. His opening six were solid if unspectacular, but what came next would change his tournament.

**The Middle Six Explosion**

Holes seven through twelve belonged entirely to Williams. Twenty Stableford points in six holes—the round's best split—catapulted him into contention. The par-5 ninth, the day's easiest hole at just 0.33 over par, provided a scoring opportunity that Williams seized, but his brilliance extended across the entire middle stretch. Alex Baker stayed in touch with 18 points, while Jon Baker's 17 kept his momentum rolling. Mullin remained consistent, neither surging nor falling away.

At this point, multiple players were threatening. Alex Baker sat at 35 points through twelve holes. Jon Baker had compiled 35 as well. The tournament appeared wide open.

**Closing Stretch Carnage**

Then Palmares bared its teeth.

The final six holes—particularly the par-4 14th and 18th, both averaging 2.33 over par—became execution grounds. Jon Baker's tournament hopes evaporated with just 10 points across the closing stretch, his early brilliance reduced to a cruel memory. Alex Baker suffered an identical fate: 10 points from the final six after threatening to challenge for the lead. Stuart Neumann endured the worst collapse of all, managing just 6 points as his round disintegrated.

Williams held firm with 14 points down the stretch, his steadiness under pressure contrasting sharply with the chaos around him. Mullin closed with 13 points, doing exactly what a leader must do—matching the conditions rather than fighting them. When the carnage cleared, Mullin still led, Williams had surged into a tie for second, and multiple challengers had seen their momentum destroyed by Palmares' cruel finishing stretch.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** GW 48 | AB 45 | JB 45 | DM 42 | SN 37 | JP 35  
**Round 2 Gross:** GW +14 | AB +17 | JB +17 | DM +20 | JP +27 | SN +28

**Tournament Stableford:** DM 91 | AB 86 | GW 86 | JB 82 | SN 69 | JP 64  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +35 | AB +39 | JB +49 | GW +52 | JP +56 | SN +60

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining,** the TEG Trophy battle has crystallised into a three-horse race, while the Green Jacket remains David Mullin's to lose.

Mullin's five-point Stableford advantage looks comfortable but is far from decisive. He's averaging 45.5 points per round—maintain that standard and he'll require 91 total across the final two rounds. The challengers know their mathematics: Alex Baker and Gregg Williams, tied on 86, need approximately 48 points per round to catch him if Mullin continues at his current pace. That's a big ask, but Williams has just proven it's achievable, and the closing stretch collapses prove that Palmares can destroy a lead in six holes.

Jon Baker, nine points adrift in fourth, needs perfection—likely 50+ points per round—while hoping those ahead stumble. It's mathematically possible but requires the kind of sustained brilliance that nobody has yet shown over eighteen holes. Fifth-placed Stuart Neumann, 22 points behind, would need a miracle and multiple disasters above him.

The Green Jacket tells a different story. Mullin's four-stroke advantage in gross scoring gives him substantial breathing room. Barring catastrophe, the gross competition appears settled, though Alex Baker remains within striking distance should Mullin suffer a genuine collapse.

The Spoon remains John Patterson's to defend. Twenty-seven points behind Mullin, he'd need to average 49 points per round just to threaten fifth place—unlikely given his 32-point average through two rounds.

### Round Highlights

- Gregg Williams' middle-six explosion: 20 Stableford points in six holes, launching him into contention
- Jon Baker's tale of two nines: 18 points through six, only 10 across the final six
- The closing stretch massacre: H14 and H18 both averaging 2.33 over par, destroying multiple challenges
- Alex Baker reaching 35 points through twelve holes before fading to 45 for the round
- Stuart Neumann's horror finish: just 6 points across the final six holes

### Player Summaries

**David Mullin:** Dropped from 49 to 42 points but protected his lead with smart course management when others imploded. His steady back nine (20 points when carnage surrounded him) exemplifies tournament golf.

**Gregg Williams:** The day's revelation with 48 points, a ten-point improvement on his opening round. His middle-six dominance (20 points) and composed finish moved him into a tie for second.

**Alex Baker:** Improved to 45 points but will rue what might have been. Superb through twelve holes (35 points) before the closing stretch reduced him to just 10 points across the final six.

**Jon Baker:** The round's most dramatic collapse. From 18 points through six holes to just 10 across the final six—a microcosm of Palmares' ability to punish. Stays fourth but momentum has evaporated.

**Stuart Neumann:** Respectable through twelve holes (31 points) before the worst finish of the day—6 points across the final six. His 37-point round keeps him fifth but 22 points off the pace.

**John Patterson:** The most consistent player in the field, which in his case means consistently behind. His 35 points improved on round one, but he remains 27 points adrift and the Spoon frontrunner.
