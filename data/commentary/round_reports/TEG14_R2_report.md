# TEG 14 - Round 2 Report

## Mullin Surges Clear as Littlestone Bares Its Teeth
**Littlestone • 05/11/2021 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin arrived at Littlestone holding a slender three-point advantage, but left with a stranglehold on TEG Trophy 14. His stunning 41-point performance—powered by a dominant middle-six stretch—opened up a commanding nine-point lead at the tournament's halfway stage.

While Mullin strengthened his grip, Alex Baker responded to the challenge with a superb closing surge, posting 15 points over the final six holes to keep his trophy hopes alive with 35 points on the day. The course showed its teeth early, with the brutal par-4 4th and par-5 5th combination averaging 2.5 strokes over par and decimating the field's scoring potential.

Behind the leaders, positions remained remarkably static. Gregg Williams struggled to a disappointing 27 points to hold third, while Jon Baker's steady 29-point effort kept him fourth. But with two rounds remaining, the gaps have widened dramatically—Williams trails by 21 points, Baker by 23—and the real battle now appears to be for second place.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes provided an early warning of what Littlestone had in store. While Mullin posted a solid 10 points to edge the opening stretch, the real story was carnage at the 4th and 5th. The par-4 4th averaged 6.5 strokes—2.5 over par—and the following par-5 proved no easier at 7.5 strokes. By the 6th tee, the field was battered, though the par-3 6th offered brief respite with an average of 2.5 Stableford points.

**The Defining Stretch**

Everything changed over holes seven through twelve. This is where Mullin seized control of the tournament, exploding for 16 points across the middle six while the field averaged under 10. The par-5 7th proved relatively friendly at 1.75 points per player, and Mullin capitalised ruthlessly. Behind him, Alex Baker posted a respectable 11 points to stay in touch, but Williams (10 points) and Jon Baker (9 points) watched the leaders pull away. The par-4 12th proved a sting in the tail, averaging 1.75 strokes over par.

**Late Fireworks**

Alex Baker saved his best for last, firing 15 points over the closing six holes—the best finish of the day—to prevent the gap from becoming insurmountable. Mullin matched him stroke for stroke with his own 15-point finish, demonstrating the control of a leader who refuses to crack. The par-3 14th provided the day's easiest opportunity at just half a stroke over par, while the par-5 18th proved relatively scorable at 0.75 over. Jon Baker's 11-point close was his best spell of the day, but Williams limped home with only 8 points as his trophy challenge faded.

### Standings After Round 2

**Tournament Gross:** DM +26 | AB +41 | GW +55 | JB +60

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Mullin's nine-point cushion is substantial but far from insurmountable over 36 holes. To protect his lead, he needs to average just 32 points per round—well below his 40.5-point average so far. Baker, however, faces a steep challenge: he needs to average 41 points per round AND hope Mullin falters. Given Mullin has posted 40 and 41 in the opening rounds, that's a tall order requiring both exceptional play and the leader's collapse.

The real intrigue may be the battle for second place. Williams trails Baker by 12 points but has shown inconsistency, dropping from 33 to 27 points between rounds. He'd need to average 39 points just to catch Baker, while Baker needs only 30-point rounds to hold him off. Jon Baker sits 23 points off the lead and 14 behind third place—mathematically alive but needing career rounds to challenge.

In the Green Jacket gross competition, Mullin also leads by 15 strokes over Baker, making a double triumph increasingly likely. The trophy leader has established himself as the man to beat across both competitions, and with his current form, the chasing pack needs something special over the final two days.

### Round Highlights
- Mullin's monster middle-six (16 points) builds commanding lead
- Brutal 4th-5th combination averages 2.5 over par, destroys field scoring
- Baker's 15-point closing surge best finish of the day
- Par-3 14th offers rare respite as easiest hole (average 0.5 over)
- All four players hold positions—no movement despite scoring fluctuations

### Player Summaries

**David MULLIN:** Improved to 41 points with a dominant middle-six stretch (16 points), building a nine-point tournament lead at 81 points total. Leads both TEG Trophy and Green Jacket competitions.

**Alex BAKER:** Posted 35 points with a superb back-nine (21 points including 15-point finish), but slipped to nine points behind leader at 72 points total. Best chance to challenge lies in catching fire over final two rounds.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Disappointing 27-point round (down 6 from R1) saw him maintain third place but fall 21 points behind leader at 60 points total. Needs dramatic improvement to challenge for trophy.

**Jon BAKER:** Steady 29-point effort matched his opening round but leaves him 23 points off the pace at 58 points total. Improving slightly but gap to leaders continues to widen.
