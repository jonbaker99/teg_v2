## Round Report

# Williams Holds Nerve in Final-Round Thriller
**PGA Catalunya - Stadium • 24/09/2013 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams arrived at PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course with a slender three-point cushion and a lead that looked increasingly vulnerable. By the seventh hole, it had evaporated entirely, Jon Baker seizing control with a blistering start. But Williams, showing the composure that defines champions, clawed his way back at the tenth and never relinquished his grip. Despite David Mullin's round-winning 33 points threatening to shake up the standings, Williams ground out 28 hard-earned points to claim the TEG Trophy by three, his back-nine brilliance of 18 points ultimately proving decisive.

The final round delivered drama from the opening tee, with positions fluid and scoring opportunities sporadic. Baker's early charge set pulses racing, while Williams' shaky opening threatened disaster. The par-5 third hole—playing as the tournament's hardest at 2.6 strokes over par—proved a graveyard for ambitions. But when the scoring corridor opened on the back nine, Williams found another gear just when he needed it most.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker came out firing. Thirteen points through the opening six holes—the field's best start—propelled him past Williams and into the tournament lead at the seventh. For a brief moment, the trophy seemed destined for new hands. Williams, meanwhile, managed just eight points through those opening holes, his challenge appearing to unravel before it had truly begun.

David Mullin had other ideas about stealing headlines. The fourth-placed player unleashed a scorching opening salvo of 11 points, then added 14 more through the middle six—serving notice that he hadn't surrendered to mathematics. At the par-5 third, though, everyone suffered. The hole devoured shots, averaging a brutal 7.6 strokes, 2.6 over par, claiming victims across the leaderboard and briefly threatening to turn the tournament on its head.

The middle six holes belonged to Stuart Neumann. His tournament-best 13 points through holes seven to twelve kept him within touching distance, while Baker's early momentum stalled dramatically—just nine points as his challenge cooled. Williams, though, found his rhythm. Twelve points through the middle stretch, and crucially, he reclaimed the lead at the tenth hole, reaching 130 points just as a scoring corridor opened. The tenth and eleventh holes played as the round's easiest, both averaging just 0.8 over par, and Williams capitalised ruthlessly.

Coming home, Williams played percentage golf. Eight points through the closing six holes might not inspire poetry, but they sealed victory with cold efficiency. Baker and Neumann closed strongly—10 and 11 points respectively—but the mathematics had turned insurmountable. Mullin's round-winning 33 points earned plaudits but couldn't overcome his overnight deficit, while Henry Meller's steady 26 points saw him safely home in fifth. When Williams signed for his card, the TEG Trophy was his, three points clear of Baker's valiant pursuit.

### Round Highlights

- **Lead Change Drama:** Baker's blistering start seized the lead at H7, only for Williams to snatch it back three holes later—and never let go
- **Mullin's Masterclass:** Round-winning 33 points included an 11-point opening surge and 14 through the middle six—too little, too late
- **The Third Hole Graveyard:** Tournament's hardest hole averaged 7.6 strokes, 2.6 over par, claiming victims across the field
- **Neumann's Consistency:** Tournament-best 13 points through holes 7-12 showcased his methodical brilliance
- **Back Nine Scoring:** Holes 10 and 11 played as the round's easiest (both 0.8 over par), opening the door for Williams' decisive surge

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Survived early jitters (8 pts through six holes) to claim the TEG Trophy with 145 points total, his 18-point back nine sealing a hard-fought three-point victory despite finishing third in the Green Jacket with 103 gross strokes.

**Jon Baker:** Scorching 13-point start briefly delivered the lead at H7, but a nine-point middle six proved costly as he finished runner-up with 142 tournament points—though claimed the Green Jacket with 99 gross strokes, four clear of Williams.

**Stuart Neumann:** Most consistent player across the round (16-16 front/back split) finished third with 139 points, his tournament-high 13-point middle stretch highlighting quality that couldn't quite bridge the gap.

**David Mullin:** Round-winning 33 points—featuring an electric 11-point opening six and 14 through the middle stretch—catapulted him to fourth overall with 135 points, five clear of Meller but ten adrift of the podium.

**Henry Meller:** Remarkably consistent across all three six-hole stretches (8-8-10 split) secured fifth place with 123 tournament points, finishing 22 points behind Williams despite a steady 26-point final round.
