# TEG 8 - Round 1 Report

## Williams Surges to Command as Baker Brothers Battle Takes Shape
**Quinta da Marinha • 25 November 2015 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The opening salvo of TEG Trophy VIII belonged to Gregg Williams, who seized control at the turn and never looked back, carding 38 Stableford points to establish a four-point cushion atop the leaderboard. The round told two contrasting stories: Alex Baker's explosive start that promised dominance but delivered disappointment, and Williams' methodical middle-six surge that proved championship golf requires patience as much as brilliance.

Jon Baker emerged as Williams' closest pursuer with a steady 34 points, while the battle for third produced a tie between Alex Baker and David Mullin at 30 points. The day's cautionary tale came from Stuart Neumann, whose catastrophic middle stretch yielded just two points across six holes, leaving him 21 points adrift and facing a mountain to climb with three rounds remaining.

### How It Unfolded

Alex Baker announced his intentions immediately, racking up 17 Stableford points across the opening six holes at Quinta da Marinha. The hot start had him clear of the field, with Williams and Jon Baker trailing on 13 points each through the same stretch. The par-3 2nd played as the day's easiest hole, and Baker capitalised while others struggled to match his early aggression.

Everything changed at the turn. Williams detonated with 16 points across holes seven through twelve—the round's best six-hole split—while Alex Baker's game imploded. By the time the field reached the par-4 10th, Williams had seized the lead in a dramatic shift marked by twelve scoring events on that single hole. Baker managed just seven points across that crucial middle stretch as his tournament hopes began to evaporate.

The back nine proved treacherous for everyone. Holes 12 and 13, both par-4s averaging 2.33 strokes over par, became the round's twin terrors. Jon Baker navigated the chaos with quiet efficiency, posting 12 points in the final six holes to solidify second place. David Mullin matched that closing surge to salvage his round after struggling through the middle. Williams, needing only to protect his advantage, played smart golf for nine final points to close out a balanced 19-19 front-back split.

Alex Baker's fade from contention was complete in the closing stretch—just six points across the final six holes left him eight points off the pace and facing questions about whether his opening fireworks had cost him the energy to finish. Stuart Neumann's tournament effectively ended in the middle six, where a two-point return left him mathematically alive but practically eliminated.

### Standings After Round 1

**Round 1 Stableford:** GW 38 | JB 34 | AB 30 | DM 30 | HM 29 | SN 17  
**Round 1 Gross:** DM +20 | JB +21 | GW +26 | HM +29 | AB +41 | SN +43

**Tournament Stableford:** GW 38 | JB 34 | AB 30 | DM 30 | HM 29 | SN 17  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +20 | JB +21 | GW +26 | HM +29 | AB +41 | SN +43

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining**, Williams holds the TEG Trophy advantage but hardly an insurmountable one. A four-point cushion suggests he needs to average around 33 points per round to stay ahead if Jon Baker matches his opening form. Baker requires approximately 35-36 points per round to catch Williams—achievable given his steady performance, but demanding consistency under pressure.

The tie for third at 30 points keeps Alex Baker and David Mullin very much in contention. Eight points off the pace with three rounds to play means either player could catch Williams with rounds of 35+ while the leader falters. Alex Baker's ability to post 17 points in six holes proves he has the firepower; the question is whether he can sustain it across eighteen holes. Mullin's strong finish (12 points in the final six) suggests he's found something to build on.

Henry Meller at 29 points remains a dark horse—nine points back isn't impossible to make up, but he'll need to find form that eluded him today. Stuart Neumann's 21-point deficit makes his trophy challenge purely theoretical. However, the Green Jacket competition tells a different story: Mullin's 20-over gross leads Baker by just one stroke, with Williams lurking five shots back. That secondary competition remains wide open, regardless of the Stableford standings.

### Round Highlights
- Alex Baker's scorching 17-point opening six holes, taking early command before the wheels came off
- Gregg Williams' dominant 16-point surge across holes 7-12, the round's decisive move
- The dramatic lead change at the 10th hole, featuring twelve scoring events
- Twin terrors at holes 12 and 13, both averaging 2.33 over par
- Stuart Neumann's catastrophic middle stretch—just two points across six holes ending any realistic trophy hopes

### Player Summaries

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Perfectly balanced 19-19 split anchored by a dominant middle six (16 points) gave Williams the opening-round victory and early tournament control. His 38 points and steady closing stretch established him as the man to catch.

**Jon BAKER:** The most consistent performer of the day with splits of 13-9-12, Jon Baker trails by four but looks the most likely challenger. His steady 34 points and solid gross score of +21 keeps him in both competitions.

**Alex BAKER:** Started like a champion with 17 points in the opening six holes but faded dramatically (7-6 in the next two stretches). His 30 points and +41 gross leave him eight back in the Trophy race but well positioned if he rediscovers his opening form.

**David MULLIN:** Struggled through the middle (6 points on H7-12) but rallied with 12 points in the closing stretch. His 30 points matches Alex Baker, while his +20 gross leads the Green Jacket competition.

**Henry MELLER:** Steady but unspectacular 9-11-9 splits produced 29 points and +29 gross. Nine points off the Trophy pace leaves him needing a spark over the next three rounds.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** A disastrous middle stretch (2 points across H7-12) left him 21 points behind after round one. His 17-point total and +43 gross make recovery in either competition highly unlikely.
