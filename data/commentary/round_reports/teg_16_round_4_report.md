## Round Report

# Neumann Seals Wire-to-Wire Trophy Victory as Mullin Claims Final Round
**Estoril • 10/10/2023 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Stuart Neumann arrived at Estoril with a 13-point cushion and a simple mandate: don't implode. What unfolded was anything but defensive golf. The tournament leader exploded from the gates with 18 points through six holes—the field's best opening stretch—to extinguish any lingering hopes of a final-round collapse. While David Mullin claimed the day's honours with a spectacular 45-point performance, Neumann's 43-point reply ensured the TEG Trophy would return to his mantelpiece with a commanding 13-point margin.

The day's secondary drama centred on the battle for third, where Mullin's surge (+15 points on his previous round) lifted him past Jon Baker, whose disappointing 32-point effort saw him tumble from the podium places. Baker's fade represented the round's only significant position change, as Gregg Williams comfortably held second and Alex Baker remained anchored in fifth, his slow-start-strong-finish pattern continuing to the last.

### How It Unfolded

Neumann's opening statement came swift and emphatic. Through the first six holes, he piled up 18 Stableford points—a blistering pace that had the tournament sewn up before the back nine even beckoned. While others navigated the treacherous par-4 opener (averaging +2.0 against par across the field), Neumann found his rhythm immediately, building the kind of buffer that transforms pressure into procession.

The par-3 second hole provided brief respite for everyone, playing as the day's easiest at level par with a 3.4-point average. But it was merely the eye of the storm before Neumann continued his early assault, staking his claim while challengers fumbled.

Then came Mullin's counter-surge. Having started steadily with 14 points through six, the fourth-round leader found top gear on holes seven through twelve, posting the field's best middle stretch with 17 points. It was golf of the highest calibre—but ultimately golf for pride rather than position. Williams matched his consistency with measured splits of 15-14-13, content to protect second place without unnecessary heroics.

Baker's fade proved decisive for the podium positions. After opening with just 10 points, he never recovered the momentum, managing only 32 points total—his worst return of the tournament and precisely one point fewer than his previous round. Mullin's inspired middle-six surge was enough to leapfrog him into third.

The closing stretch offered no late drama. Three players—Williams, Mullin, and Alex Baker—shared the best final-six tally with 14 points apiece, but with Neumann posting a solid 13-point finish, the tournament had long since been decided. The wire-to-wire victory was complete.

### Standings After Round 4

**Round 4 Stableford:** DM 45 | SN 43 | GW 42 | AB 33 | JB 32  
**Round 4 Gross:** DM +11 | GW +11 | SN +23 | JB +24 | AB +38

**Final Stableford:** SN 156 | GW 143 | DM 142 | JB 131 | AB 127  
**Final Gross:** DM +60 | JB +67 | AB +80 | GW +89 | SN +94

### Tournament Concluded

**Trophy Champion:** Stuart Neumann (156 points)

The numbers tell the story of Neumann's dominance: a wire-to-wire victory secured with round-by-round consistency rather than pyrotechnics. His 13-point winning margin over Williams matched his overnight lead, confirmation that the final round never threatened to deliver late drama. Neumann's opening salvo—that barnstorming 18 points through six holes—set the tone, and his 43-point total represented a four-point improvement on his third round.

Williams' runner-up finish, 13 points adrift, owed much to his spectacular third-round 37 points, though his 42-point finale demonstrated he remained in excellent form through the closing stretch. Mullin's third-place finish came courtesy of a stunning final-round performance that represented a 15-point improvement on his third-round horror show. That 45-point return—the day's best by three—salvaged what could have been a disappointing tournament.

Baker slipped to fourth despite starting the day in third, his 32-point effort insufficient against Mullin's charge. He finishes 25 points behind the champion. Alex Baker's fifth place, 29 points back, reflected his tournament-long inconsistency—his final-round pattern of slow start (8 points) and strong finish (14 points on the back nine) mirroring his broader struggles.

### Round Highlights

- Stuart Neumann's explosive opening stretch: 18 points through six holes, the tournament's best start, killing the competition before it began
- David Mullin's middle-six masterclass: 17 points on holes 7-12, the field's finest sustained spell, propelling him from fourth to third
- Par-3 second hole proves the day's lone sanctuary: averaging level par and 3.4 points, a brief respite amid the carnage
- Jon Baker's fade from the podium: 32 points total, down on his previous round, allowing Mullin to leapfrog into third
- The anticlimactic finish: three players sharing best closing-six with 14 points, but the Trophy long since decided

### Player Summaries

**Stuart Neumann:** Champion's golf from start to finish—43 points including an explosive 18-point opening stretch sealed a wire-to-wire Trophy victory by 13 points. Wire-to-wire winner.
