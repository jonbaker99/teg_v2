# TEG 6 - Round 1 Report

## Williams Seizes Control After Wild Early Battle
**PGA Catalunya - Tour • 21/09/2013 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The opening round of TEG 6 delivered instant drama as the lead changed hands five times through the first nine holes before Gregg Williams finally seized control and never looked back. Williams carded an exceptional 48 Stableford points to claim both the round victory and the tournament lead, building a commanding nine-point cushion over his nearest challenger.

The early battle between Williams and David Mullin captivated through the front nine, with neither player able to shake free. But Williams found another gear after the turn, dominating the back nine with 28 points to pull clear. Behind him, Jon Baker authored the comeback story of the day, erupting for 26 back-nine points after a sluggish start to snatch second place from Mullin.

In the secondary Green Jacket (gross) competition, Williams also leads with 20 strokes, holding a two-shot advantage over Baker (18) and Mullin (17), setting up intriguing dual-competition battles over the remaining three rounds.

### How It Unfolded

The tournament exploded into life immediately, with Williams and Mullin trading blows through the opening holes. Williams drew first blood at the par-4 2nd to take the lead, only for Mullin to answer immediately at the 3rd. Williams reclaimed the advantage at the 4th, but Mullin struck back again at the 5th in a compelling display of shot-for-shot golf.

The pivotal moment came at the turn. Williams posted four points at the par-5 9th to reach 20 points for his front nine and seize the lead for the fifth and final time. What followed was a masterclass in sustained excellence—Williams added 17 points through the middle six holes, the best split in the field, to break clear of the pack.

While Williams built his advantage, Baker was quietly engineering a remarkable turnaround. After stumbling to just nine points through the opening six holes, the early deficit looked insurmountable. But Baker found his rhythm over holes 7-12, posting 12 points to stay within striking distance of the podium places.

The final six holes brought the day's most explosive golf. Williams refused to ease off, matching Baker's electrifying 18-point finish to seal his comprehensive victory. Baker's closing burst—the joint-best finish of the day—propelled him past the fading Mullin into second place. Mullin managed only 10 points over the final six, paying the price for his earlier exertions, and dropped to third despite his strong start.

Behind the leaders, Stuart Neumann produced the day's most consistent round, posting splits of 11-11-12 to secure fourth place on 34 points, while Henry Meller's steady 10-10-11 distribution left him trailing by 17 points in fifth.

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Williams has seized a significant early advantage, but history suggests nine points is far from insurmountable over 54 holes. To protect his lead, Williams needs to average roughly 37-38 points per round—challenging but achievable given his opening form. Baker needs to match or better Williams by three points per round to close the gap, requiring consistently strong performances in the high 30s to low 40s.

Mullin remains firmly in contention, just 11 points adrift, needing to find four points per round on Williams while maintaining his own mid-to-high 30s scoring. The battle for third could prove equally compelling—Neumann sits 14 back but showed the consistency that wins over multiple rounds, while Meller faces a steep 17-point deficit that will require something special to overcome.

The real mathematical cut-off lies somewhere around 15-18 points back—any further and the mountain becomes Everest. Neumann can still realistically challenge for the TEG Trophy, but needs to start closing gaps immediately. In the Green Jacket race, the margins are tighter still—just three strokes separate the top three, making every shot crucial. Williams holds the driver's seat in both competitions, but with 54 holes ahead and this group's capacity for big swings, nothing is decided.

### Round Highlights

- Five lead changes through the first nine holes between Williams and Mullin
- Baker's remarkable recovery—18 points over the final six holes after managing just nine through the first six
- Williams's dominant 28-point back nine, including the field's best middle-six split (17 points)
- The par-4 3rd and 4th proving the day's sternest tests, averaging 2.0 strokes over par
- Williams seizing both Trophy and Jacket leads simultaneously

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** An authoritative opening statement—48 points and a wire-to-wire victory after the 9th hole. His 28-point back nine and sustained excellence through all three splits (13-17-18) established him as the clear favourite. Also leads the Green Jacket by two strokes.

**Jon Baker:** The comeback king—transformed a disastrous start (nine points through six) into a strong second place finish with an explosive 26-point back nine. His 18-point closing surge keeps him well within striking distance nine points back.

**David Mullin:** Started brilliantly with 19 front-nine points and led multiple times early, but a fading 10-point finish over the final six dropped him to third, 11 points behind Williams. Still very much in contention but must rediscover his early form.

**Stuart Neumann:** The model of consistency with splits of 11-11-12, though his steady approach left him 14 points off the pace. Needs to add more firepower while maintaining his reliability to challenge for the Trophy.

**Henry Meller:** The most evenly-paced round (10-10-11) but never threatened the leaders. Trailing by 17 points, he faces a mathematical challenge that will require significant improvement and help from those ahead.
