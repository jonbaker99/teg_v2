# TEG 9 - Round 2 Report

# Patterson's Middle-Six Surge Shatters the Field

**Praia D'El Rey • 01/10/2016 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Praia D'El Rey with a slender one-point lead, but by day's end, the tournament had been turned on its head. John Patterson obliterated the field with a spectacular 49-point performance—11 points better than his opening round—to seize command with an imposing 10-point advantage. The drama unfolded in waves: David Mullin briefly wrested the lead at the par-4 2nd, Patterson launched a devastating middle-six assault worth 20 points, then closed with a back-nine bonanza of 30 points that left the field gasping.

Baker's title defence crumbled early. After managing just nine points through the opening six holes—the worst start of anyone in contention—he tumbled from first to a tie for third despite a spirited late rally. His brother Alex produced the round's best front nine (25 points) to join him in joint third, whilst Mullin's solid 39 points keeps him in the hunt. But this was Patterson's day, a performance built on the brutal middle stretch where he turned a one-point deficit into an unassailable lead.

### How It Unfolded

The tournament's complexion changed almost immediately. At the par-4 2nd, David Mullin seized the lead from Patterson, reaching 43 cumulative points whilst the defending champion Jon Baker sputtered through the opening stretch. By the time the field reached the par-4 6th—the day's hardest hole at 2.17 strokes over par—Baker had managed just nine points across six holes whilst his brother Alex was building something special with 15.

But Patterson was loading the chamber. Beginning at the 7th, he unleashed a middle-six barrage worth 20 points that formed the spine of his round. Whilst others struggled through the par-4 9th (matching the 6th as the day's joint-hardest), Patterson was relentless. By the time he reached the par-4 12th—a pivotal seven-event-count hole—he'd reclaimed the tournament lead at 68 cumulative points and would never look back.

The back nine became a scoring bonanza. The par-4 13th, the course's easiest hole at just half a stroke over par, opened the floodgates. Patterson poured in 30 points across the back nine—the best nine-hole performance of the entire round—including 19 in the final six alone. The par-4 17th proved particularly generous, averaging three points per player, and Patterson capitalised ruthlessly. Alex Baker stayed consistent with 15 points down the stretch to muscle his way into a tie for third, whilst Jon Baker's matching 15 came too late to repair the damage. Mullin faded slightly with 12 closing points, watching his early lead evaporate as Patterson's extraordinary round pushed him 10 points clear at the summit.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Patterson's 10-point cushion is substantial but far from unassailable—his own 11-point improvement this round proves how quickly fortunes can shift at Praia D'El Rey. To protect his lead, he needs to average just 39 points per round (matching his opening performance), though maintaining his current form would effectively end the contest. Mullin, sitting second, requires approximately 44 points per round to catch the leader, a tall order but achievable given Patterson's opening round of 38.

The real drama centres on the battle for third. Jon and Alex Baker are deadlocked on 76 points, with both needing spectacular performances to threaten Patterson—roughly 49 points per round just to draw level. More realistically, they're scrapping for the podium alongside Mullin, with gaps of 10-11 points eminently catchable over 36 holes. Gregg Williams at 67 points faces a mathematical mountain but remains within theoretical range if he can find form.

The Spoon battle has lost its competitive edge—Stuart Neumann trails fifth-placed Williams by 14 points with just two rounds remaining, requiring an unlikely 43-point average to escape last place whilst Williams collapses. In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's consistency (+53 gross) gives him a nine-stroke cushion over Patterson, suggesting the Trophy and Jacket could be heading to different mantlepieces.

### Round Highlights

- **Patterson's middle-six rampage:** Twenty points across holes 7-12 transformed the tournament, reclaiming the lead at the pivotal par-4 12th
- **The Baker contrast:** Alex's dominant 25-point front nine versus Jon's disastrous nine-point start through six holes
- **Back-nine bonanza:** Patterson's 30-point haul included 19 in the closing stretch, the round's best nine-hole performance
- **Early drama at the 2nd:** Mullin briefly seized the tournament lead, only to watch Patterson snatch it back ten holes later
- **The par-4 gauntlet:** Holes 6 and 9 averaging 2.17 over par separated contenders from pretenders

### Player Summaries

**John PATTERSON:** Devastated the field with 49 points (+11 from R1), building his round on a 20-point middle-six and capping it with 30 on the back nine to storm from second to first with a commanding 10-point lead.

**David MULLIN:** Solid 39 points (+1 from R1) maintained second place, briefly led after the 2nd hole but couldn't match Patterson's surge; now 10 points adrift but holding a nine-stroke advantage in the Gross competition.

**Jon BAKER:** Defending champion's title defence wobbled badly with 37 points (-2 from R1), a catastrophic nine-point start through six holes dropping him from first to joint third; recovered late but trails by 11 points.

**Alex BAKER:** Stormed up the leaderboard with 44 points (+12 from R1), the round's best front nine (25 points) propelling him from fourth to joint third alongside his brother; now 11 points behind the leader with two rounds to play.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Steady 36 points (+5 from R1) kept him in fifth but 20 points behind Patterson; needs something extraordinary over the final two rounds to challenge for the Trophy.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Improved to 30 points (+7 from R1) but remains rooted to sixth, 34 points behind the leader and increasingly likely to collect the Wooden Spoon.
