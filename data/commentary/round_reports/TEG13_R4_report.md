# TEG 13 - Round 4 Report

# Baker Brothers Seal the Deal at Prince's

**Prince's Golf Club - Shore/Dunes • 11/10/2020 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Prince's Shore/Dunes Course clutching a six-point lead with destiny in his hands. Four rounds of disciplined golf had built his advantage, and only a collapse could deny him the TEG Trophy. His younger brother Alex, meanwhile, languished in fifth place, seemingly out of contention for silverware.

By day's end, the Baker family had doubled their joy. Jon claimed the Trophy with a composed 39-point finale, while Alex produced the tournament's standout round—a magnificent 44 points—to surge from fifth to a podium finish. Jon's 158-point total gave him a comfortable six-point victory over Gregg Williams, whose own strong finish secured second place. The brothers' contrasting paths to success bookended a round that saw John Patterson's title hopes evaporate and David Mullin's consistency finally desert him at the crucial moment.

Patterson's early eagle at the par-5 2nd briefly promised drama, but Alex Baker's dominant middle six holes—17 points in a brutal stretch that included the day's hardest hole—changed the narrative completely.

### How It Unfolded

**Early Promise**

Patterson signaled his intentions immediately, carding an eagle at the par-5 2nd for five Stableford points. His opening six yielded 15 points, the kind of start that keeps challengers dreaming. Jon Baker, playing with the authority of a leader, matched steady pars and collected 14 points to maintain control. Alex Baker quietly joined him on 14, while David Mullin's 15-point opening suggested he might yet make a late run at the podium.

Gregg Williams, six points behind Jon starting the day, managed only 12 points through the first six. His title challenge was effectively over before it began.

**The Turning Point**

The middle six holes proved decisive. Alex Baker unleashed the round of the tournament, amassing 17 points across holes 7-12 despite the par-4 10th playing as a monster—averaging six strokes against par, two over. While competitors wrestled with the Shore/Dunes layout, Alex found his rhythm with a combination of birdies and solid pars that left the rest trailing.

Mullin's tournament unraveled here. Having opened strongly, he collapsed to just eight points across this crucial stretch. His podium dreams disappeared into the Kent coastline. Jon Baker's steady 11 points maintained his cushion, while Patterson's 12 kept him in silverware contention.

**Closing Time**

Williams saved his best for last. Sixteen points across the final six holes—his strongest stretch of the day—guaranteed second place and ensured the Baker brothers wouldn't have the podium to themselves. Jon Baker's professional 14-point close removed any lingering doubt about the Trophy winner, his 39-point round exactly what the situation demanded.

Alex held his nerve with 13 points coming home, enough to leapfrog both Patterson and Mullin into joint third. Patterson faded to 11 points over the closing stretch, his round petering out after that early eagle. His 36-point total—13 points worse than his stunning Round 3 performance of 49—represented the day's biggest disappointment.

### What's At Stake

With the tournament now concluded, Jon Baker's Trophy victory caps a remarkably consistent four-round performance. His 158 points included no round below 37 and no blow-up moments—the hallmark of a deserving champion. The six-point margin over Williams might suggest comfort, but it represented hard-earned breathing room built across 72 holes.

Alex Baker's final-round heroics earned him a share of third place, proving that momentum matters even when the tournament leader is your brother. His 44 points—12 better than his Round 3 showing—demonstrates the fine margins that separate podium finishes from also-ran status. Had he found this form one round earlier, the trophy battle might have been a family affair.

Patterson will rue his final-round fade. After his stunning 49-point Round 3 moved him into contention, his 36-point finale cost him outright third place. The 13-point drop between rounds tells the story of opportunity lost. Mullin's inconsistent closing round—strong opening, disastrous middle, decent finish—epitomizes his tournament: flashes of quality undermined by costly lapses.
