# TEG 6 - Round 4 Report

# Williams Holds Nerve in Final-Round Thriller
**PGA Catalunya - Stadium • 24/09/2013 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams arrived at PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course with a slender three-point cushion and a lead that looked increasingly vulnerable. By the seventh hole, it had evaporated entirely, Jon Baker seizing control with a blistering start. But Williams, showing the composure that defines champions, clawed his way back at the tenth and never relinquished his grip. Despite David Mullin's round-winning 33 points threatening to shake up the standings, Williams ground out 28 hard-earned points to claim the TEG Trophy by three, his back-nine brilliance of 18 points ultimately proving decisive.

The final round delivered drama from the opening tee, with positions fluid and scoring opportunities sporadic. Baker's early charge set pulses racing, while Williams' shaky opening threatened disaster. The par-5 third hole—playing as the tournament's hardest at 2.6 strokes over par—proved a graveyard for ambitions. But when the scoring corridor opened on the back nine, Williams found another gear just when he needed it most.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker came out firing. Thirteen points through the opening six holes—the field's best start—propelled him past Williams and into the tournament lead at the seventh. For a brief moment, the trophy seemed destined for new hands. Williams, meanwhile, managed just eight points through those opening holes, his challenge appearing to unravel before it had truly begun.

David Mullin had other ideas about stealing headlines. The fourth-placed player unleashed a scorching opening salvo of 11 points, then added 14 more through the middle six—serving notice that he hadn't surrendered to mathematics. At the par-5 third, though, everyone suffered. The hole devoured shots, averaging a brutal 7.6 strokes, 2.6 over par, claiming victims across the leaderboard and briefly threatening to turn the tournament on its head.

The middle six holes belonged to Stuart Neumann. His tournament-best 13 points through holes seven to twelve kept him within touching distance, while Baker's early momentum stalled dramatically—just nine points as his challenge cooled. Williams, though, found his rhythm. Twelve points through the middle stretch, and crucially, he reclaimed the lead at the tenth hole, reaching 130 points just as a scoring corridor opened. The tenth and eleventh holes played as the round's easiest, both averaging just 0.8 over par, and Williams capitalised ruthlessly.

Coming home, Williams played percentage golf. Eight points through the closing six holes might not inspire poetry, but they sealed victory with cold efficiency. Baker and Neumann closed strongly—10 and 11 points respectively—but the mathematics had turned insurmountable. Mullin's round-winning 33 points earned plaudits but couldn't overcome his overnight deficit, while Henry Meller's steady 26 points saw him safely home in fifth. When Williams signed for his card, the TEG Trophy was his, three points clear of Baker's valiant pursuit.
