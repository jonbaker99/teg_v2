# TEG 15 - Round 1 Report

## Williams Seizes Control After Wild Opening Salvo
**Estoril • 15/10/2022 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The fifteenth TEG Trophy burst into life at Estoril with five lead changes across the opening eleven holes before Gregg Williams seized control he would never relinquish. Williams posted 39 Stableford points to establish a commanding five-point advantage, but the early drama saw the lead change hands on the second, third, fourth, tenth, and eleventh holes in a chaotic opening act.

The round's narrative arc couldn't have been more stark: Williams dominated from the front with 22 points on the outward nine, while John Patterson emerged from nowhere with a blistering 22-point back nine to claim second place. Jon Baker, who led twice in the opening stretch and held pole position as late as the tenth hole, suffered a catastrophic closing collapse—managing just seven points over the final six holes to tumble into a tie for third.

The course itself provided the day's most extreme theatre at the par-4 twelfth, which played a savage 3.5 strokes over par and yielded an average of just half a Stableford point. Relief came immediately at the thirteenth, where the field averaged 2.67 points.

### How It Unfolded

**Early Volatility**

The tournament exploded into life from the opening holes, with David Mullin striking first to claim the lead at the second hole on five total points. Jon Baker immediately responded at the third, reclaiming the advantage on seven points, but the lead proved impossible to hold. Williams made his definitive move at the par-4 fourth, seizing control on ten points and announcing his intentions with authority.

Williams built his advantage through the middle section, extending his cushion to three points by the turn. But Jon Baker wasn't finished—he clawed back to briefly retake the lead at the tenth hole on 24 points, setting up what promised to be a two-horse race down the stretch.

**The Turning Point**

Williams responded immediately at the eleventh, reclaiming the lead on 27 points and establishing control he would maintain through the finish. What followed was the round's most dramatic moment: the field walked into a buzzsaw at the twelfth, where disaster struck across the board. The hole played 3.5 strokes over par, yielding an average of just 0.5 Stableford points and reshuffling the leaderboard behind Williams.

**Contrasting Finishes**

The closing stretch separated the contenders from the pretenders. While Williams held steady with 12 points over the final six holes to secure his five-point victory, the real drama unfolded behind him. John Patterson produced the round's finest finish, firing 15 points to surge from mid-pack into second place. Stuart Neumann matched that 15-point close to climb into a share of third.

Jon Baker's collapse defined the back nine. After leading twice and scoring 13 points through the opening six holes, he managed just seven points over the final six—a dramatic reversal that saw him drop from outright contention into a four-way tie for third place, eight points adrift.

**Tournament Gross:** GW +17 | AB +22 | DM +23 | JB +24 | JP +25 | SN +26

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining**, Williams has established early control but the tournament remains wide open. His five-point cushion over Patterson represents less than two good holes—entirely catchable over 54 holes of play. The leader needs to average 26-27 points per round to stay clear, a mark well within reach given his 39-point opener.

Patterson sits in the box seat among the chasers, needing to average roughly 28 points per round to overhaul Williams. More intriguingly, the quartet bunched between 30-31 points faces an eight-point deficit—requiring them to gain roughly 2.5-3 points per round on the leader. That's manageable but demands consistency Williams hasn't yet shown signs of lacking.

The mathematics favor Williams but the margins remain thin. An off-round of 24-25 points would open the door wide, while another dominant performance in the mid-to-high 30s could effectively end the contest by the halfway mark. For the chasing pack, Round 2 becomes critical: fall further behind and the gap becomes insurmountable; close within 3-4 points and genuine pressure enters the equation.

In the secondary Green Jacket competition, Williams also leads by five strokes, though the gross scoring battle remains equally volatile with just six strokes covering the entire field.

### Round Highlights

- Five lead changes through eleven holes created unprecedented opening-round drama
- The par-4 twelfth played as a monster, averaging 3.5 over par with just 0.5 Stableford points per player
- Immediate relief at the thirteenth, which gave back 2.67 points on average
- Jon Baker's front-nine excellence (13 points in first six holes) contrasted brutally with his closing collapse (7 points in final six)
- John Patterson's closing surge (15 points over final six holes) launched him into second place
