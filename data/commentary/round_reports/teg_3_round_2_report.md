## Round Report

## Meller Claims Round Two as Baker Extends His Grip
**Boavista • 06/10/2010 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Boavista with an eight-point advantage and a question to answer: could anyone stop his march to TEG Trophy glory? The answer, after eighteen holes of inconsistent golf across the field, appears to be a resounding no. Despite a seven-point drop from his opening round heroics, Baker's 38-point performance was enough to extend his lead to eleven points with the tournament reaching its halfway mark.

Henry Meller provided the day's highlight, surging five points above his Round 1 total to claim the round victory with 38 points and an impressive gross score of 18 over par. Yet even Meller's excellent showing couldn't dent Baker's advantage—the leader never looked threatened despite the chasing pack's best efforts. Gregg Williams staged a thrilling pursuit with a blistering opening six holes before imploding mid-round, while Stuart Neumann's tale of two nines saw him salvage respectability from near-disaster.

### How It Unfolded

The opening holes sparked hope for those chasing Baker. Gregg Williams exploded from the blocks with a stunning 15 points across the first six holes, building what looked like genuine momentum. Henry Meller and David Mullin both posted solid thirteens in the same stretch, while Baker and Neumann struggled to find rhythm with modest twelves. The par-3 4th proved particularly scorable, playing nearly half a shot easier than par.

Then came the middle six, and Williams's challenge evaporated like morning mist. A catastrophic collapse saw him manage just nine points between the 7th and 12th, hemorrhaging six points and any realistic hope of pressuring the leader. Meanwhile, Meller demonstrated why he'd win the round, maintaining his form with fourteen points to establish clear daylight. Baker steadied the ship with thirteen points, matching Mullin's score through the middle stretch, while Neumann's struggles deepened with a miserable eight-point return.

The closing stretch became a battle of pride rather than position. Baker, sensing his lead was secure, closed with authority—thirteen points that sent an unmistakable message to his pursuers. Neumann found redemption with matching thirteen points, salvaging eighteen on the back nine after his front-nine nightmare of fifteen. Meller added eleven to seal his round victory. The par-4 17th emerged as the day's monster, playing more than two shots over par on average, while the 18th also bared its teeth at two over par. Williams's fade continued with just eleven points, his early fireworks now a distant memory.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** HM 38 | JB 38 | DM 35 | GW 35 | SN 33  
**Round 2 Gross:** HM +18 | DM +19 | JB +20 | GW +21 | SN +25

**Tournament Stableford:** JB 83 | DM 72 | HM 71 | GW 66 | SN 65  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +36 | HM +51 | JB +65 | GW +52 | SN +57

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

Baker's eleven-point cushion puts him in commanding position. To protect his lead, he needs to average just 36 points per round—below his current tournament average of 41.5—while his nearest challenger would need to match his opening round's 45-point explosion. The mathematics are brutal for the chasing pack: Mullin needs to average 44 points across the final two rounds while hoping Baker stumbles badly. Meller faces an even steeper climb, requiring 42.5 points per round plus a Baker collapse.

The race for second place offers genuine intrigue. Just one point separates Mullin and Meller, while Williams sits five points further back in fourth. With 35-38 point rounds clearly achievable on this course, any of these three could claim the runner-up spot. Neumann finds himself in spoon-avoidance territory at the bottom, but with two rounds to play and just a one-point deficit to Williams, nothing is settled.

In the Green Jacket gross competition, Mullin's consistency shines—his +36 total gives him a commanding fifteen-stroke advantage over the field. While the Stableford Trophy appears decided, the Jacket race still offers competitive interest for the remaining rounds.

### Round Highlights
- Gregg Williams's explosive 15-point opening six holes, raising hopes of a genuine challenge
- Williams's devastating mid-round collapse: just 9 points between holes 7-12
- Henry Meller's wire-to-wire excellence, never dropping below 11 points in any six-hole stretch
- Stuart Neumann's resurrection: 18 points on the back nine after managing just 15 on the front
- The brutal closing stretch at Boavista, with holes 17 and 18 averaging two shots over par

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Dropped seven points from his opening masterclass but never looked threatened, extending his lead to eleven points with a composed 38-point round that included strong middle (13 pts) and closing (13 pts) stretches.

**David Mullin:** Solid 35 points maintains second place, though he now trails by eleven; his consistent gross play keeps him well clear in the Green Jacket race with a fifteen-stroke advantage.

**Henry Meller:** Round winner with 38 points, matching Baker's total but closing no ground; improved five points on his opening round with particularly strong play through the middle six (14 pts).

**Gregg Williams:** Moved up to fourth despite a round of two extremes—explosive opening (15 pts) undone by middle-six meltdown (9 pts); finished with 35 points but missed opportunity to pressure the leaders.

**Stuart Neumann:** Dropped to fifth after 33-point struggle, but his remarkable back-nine recovery (18 pts) prevented complete disaster following a front-nine horror show (15 pts).
