## Round Report

# Patterson's Power Surge Seizes Control at Catalunya
**PGA Catalunya - Stadium • 05/10/2019 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

John Patterson delivered the performance of the tournament so far, firing a magnificent 45 points to storm past overnight leader Gregg Williams and claim an eight-point advantage heading into tomorrow's final round. The Englishman's devastating display featured an opening blitz of 16 points through six holes and a brutal closing surge of 17 points over the final stretch, bookending a round that saw the lead change hands twice in the early stages before Patterson stamped his authority on the Trophy race.

Williams fought valiantly to defend his position, posting a solid 36 points, but couldn't live with Patterson's inspired play. The lead swapped hands at the par-3 3rd when Williams briefly edged ahead, only for Patterson to reclaim top spot immediately at the treacherous 4th hole. From there, the momentum never shifted. Stuart Neumann matched Patterson's closing heroics with 13 points over the final six but remains 17 back in third, while Jon Baker's consistent 34-point effort keeps him in mathematical contention, 22 behind with one round to play.

The Green Jacket gross competition continues to track differently, with David Mullin still holding the advantage despite a difficult front nine in the Stableford format.

### How It Unfolded

**Opening Fireworks**

Patterson announced his intentions immediately, racing to 16 points through the opening six holes while Williams posted a respectable 12 points to keep touch from the front. The drama peaked early at the par-3 3rd, where Williams briefly grabbed the tournament lead at 95 points total, but Patterson's response was emphatic. At the brutal par-4 4th—which proved the round's hardest hole with the field averaging 2.5 over par—Patterson reclaimed the lead and never looked back.

The 2nd hole had already provided early theatre with seven significant scoring events, setting the tone for a volatile day. Relief came at the par-3 5th, the easiest hole of the round, where the field averaged just 0.17 over par and banked crucial Stableford points.

**Middle Session Tension**

Through the middle six holes, Patterson maintained his commanding position with a steady 12 points, while Williams applied pressure with 11 and Jon Baker quietly moved into contention with his own 12-point haul. The 7th produced three notable moments as players jockeyed for position, while the 12th saw five significant events that kept the leaderboard fluid behind the leading duo.

**Patterson Pulls Clear**

The tournament's defining sequence came over the closing stretch. Patterson unleashed another devastating burst, collecting 17 points from holes 13 through 18 to put the Trophy race firmly in his grasp. Williams refused to surrender, responding with 13 points of his own, but the gap had grown from manageable to daunting. Neumann matched Patterson's closing surge with 13 points to secure third place, while Alex Baker's challenge evaporated with just nine points over the final six holes, his fade dropping him to 29 points off the pace.

### Standings After Round 3

**Round 3 Stableford:** JP 45 | GW 36 | SN 35 | JB 34 | AB 32 | DM 30

**Round 3 Gross:** JP +23 | JB +25 | DM +27 | AB +32 | GW +34 | SN +35

**Tournament Stableford:** JP 132 | GW 124 | SN 115 | JB 110 | DM 105 | AB 103

**Tournament Gross:** DM +79 | JB +88 | GW +98 | SN +104 | JP +110 | AB +112

### What's At Stake

**With 1 round remaining:**

Patterson's eight-point cushion over Williams puts him in pole position, but this Trophy race is far from decided. The leader needs just 30 points tomorrow—well below his two-round average of 43.5—to secure victory even if Williams fires another 42-point masterclass. However, if Patterson stumbles below 30 and Williams produces his best round yet, the Trophy could still change hands.

Williams faces a clear equation: he needs approximately 42-45 points and hopes Patterson falters. It's a tall order but not impossible, especially given Williams proved capable of that standard in Round 2. Neumann sits 17 back and would need a career-defining 50+ point round combined with a Patterson disaster to have any realistic shot. Baker at 22 behind is mathematically alive but needs everything to break perfectly—roughly 48 points and a Patterson collapse.

The bottom three—Mullin (27 behind), Alex Baker (29 behind)—are battling for pride and potentially to escape the wooden spoon rather than chasing Trophy glory. In the Green Jacket race, Mullin's nine-stroke advantage in gross scoring gives him breathing room, though Jon Baker lurks dangerously just nine back with momentum on his side.

### Round Highlights

- Patterson's explosive 16-point opening burst through six holes set up his dominant display
- Lead changes hands twice at holes 3-4 in early drama before Patterson seizes control
- The par-4 4th proves a monster, averaging 2.5 over par and sorting contenders from pretenders
- Patterson's closing surge of 17 points over the final six holes effectively decides the Trophy race
- Alex Baker's fade from contention—just nine points in the final stretch—ends his challenge
