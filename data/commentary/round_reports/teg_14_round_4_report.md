# Mullin Holds Nerve to Claim TEG Trophy 14
**Prince's - Shore / Dunes • 07/11/2021 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin arrived at Prince's Shore/Dunes course with a slender three-point cushion and the TEG Trophy 14 title within reach. Four hours later, he walked off the 18th green as champion, holding his nerve through a testing final round to claim the trophy by two points from Alex Baker. While Baker fired the day's best round—a superb 43 points that included a dominant 24-point front nine—it wasn't enough to overturn Mullin's advantage. The champion posted a steady 37 points to finish on 154 total, with Baker closing on 152 despite his late charge.

The round played brutally, with the Shore/Dunes layout baring its teeth. Only one hole yielded under-par scoring for the field, and three holes averaged more than two strokes over par. Yet Mullin remained unflappable throughout, never relinquishing his overnight lead as the pressure mounted. Baker's fireworks made it interesting, but the trophy was destined for one player all day.

### How It Unfolded

The opening holes immediately separated the field. While the par-4 1st played treacherously—averaging 5.25 strokes and costing the field precious points—Baker navigated the early stretch brilliantly. He racked up 16 points through the opening six holes, capitalizing on the par-5 2nd (the round's only hole to play under par) and building a commanding early rhythm. Mullin posted 13 points over the same stretch—solid without spectacular—but crucially, he kept pace.

The middle six holes told a different story. Jon Baker, languishing in fourth after a disastrous Round 3, found his form with 14 points from holes 7 through 12, the strongest scoring of any player. The par-4 8th and especially the par-4 10th caused widespread damage—the 10th averaging 6.25 strokes and yielding just 1.25 points per player—but Baker navigated the chaos. Meanwhile, Mullin and Alex Baker both posted 11 points, with Gregg Williams matching that tally to hold third position. The leader's advantage remained intact through the turn.

The closing stretch became Alex Baker's stage. He surged home with 16 points from holes 13 through 18, producing the round's most compelling finish and setting a 43-point target that would win the day. But Mullin responded with 13 closing points of his own, enough to maintain his buffer despite the mounting pressure. The par-4 16th proved the round's hardest hole, averaging a brutal 6.75 strokes and yielding just 0.75 points per player, but Mullin survived it. When both players navigated the difficult 18th—averaging 6.25 strokes across the field—the trophy was decided. Mullin's consistency had trumped Baker's brilliance.

### Standings After Round 4

**Round 4 Stableford:** AB 43 | GW 38 | JB 39 | DM 37  
**Round 4 Gross:** AB +22 | GW +25 | JB +30 | DM +37

**Final Tournament Stableford:** DM 154 | AB 152 | GW 137 | JB 125  
**Final Tournament Gross:** DM +156 | AB +157 | GW +174 | JB +204

### What's At Stake

**The final reckoning:**
David Mullin claimed the TEG Trophy 14 title with 154 points, holding off Alex Baker's late surge by two points. Baker's sensational 43-point final round—six points better than the champion—ultimately fell just short of the comeback needed. The 15-point gap Baker faced entering the final day required perfection, and while he delivered his best golf of the tournament, Mullin's steady 37 points provided just enough cushion.

Gregg Williams secured third place with 137 total points, finishing 17 points behind the champion but comfortably ahead of Jon Baker in fourth. Baker's late resurgence—39 points after his Round 3 horror show of 28—couldn't salvage a higher finish, as his deficit proved too steep. The Green Jacket competition mirrored the Trophy standings, with Mullin claiming that prize as well at +156 gross, one stroke ahead of Alex Baker at +157.

### Round Highlights
- Alex Baker's magnificent 43-point round wins the day but falls two points short of the comeback
- David Mullin's nerveless 37 points under pressure secures the TEG Trophy by two
- The par-4 16th devours the field, averaging 6.75 strokes and yielding just 0.75 points per player
- Jon Baker rebounds from Round 3 disaster with 39 points, but finishes 29 points adrift in fourth
- Only the par-5 2nd plays under par for the field, providing rare relief on a brutal day

### Player Summaries
**David Mullin:** Champion with 154 points total, posted steady 37-point final round to hold off Baker's charge and claim both Trophy and Jacket titles by the narrowest of margins.

**Alex Baker:** Runner-up on 152 points after magnificent 43-point final round that included 24-point front nine, but started the day three points back and came up two points short despite best round of tournament.

**Gregg Williams:** Secured third place with 137 total points after 38-point final round, solid back nine (20 points) compensating for quieter front nine as he maintained position throughout.

**Jon BAKER:** Finished fourth on 125 points after strong recovery round of 39 points (best back nine with 21 points), but Round 3 collapse left too much ground to make up in final round.
