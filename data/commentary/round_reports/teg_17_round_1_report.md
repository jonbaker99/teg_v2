## Round Report

## Patterson's Back-Nine Blitz Seizes Opening Lead
**Praia D'El Rey • 05/10/2024 • 3 rounds remaining**

### Round Summary

The opening salvo of TEG 17 at Praia D'El Rey belonged to John Patterson, whose devastating back-nine charge of 23 points propelled him to a narrow one-point lead after a day of relentless lead changes. Patterson's 39-point haul edged Jon Baker (38 points), who blazed through the opening six holes with 15 points but couldn't sustain the pace when it mattered most.

The decisive blow came at the par-4 16th, where Patterson wrestled the lead from Baker and never looked back. Behind them, David Mullin authored the round's most remarkable comeback story—stumbling to just 6 points through the first six holes before exploding for 23 on the back nine to salvage a share of third place with Gregg Williams at 33 points. Alex Baker's early promise faded to fifth at 32 points after losing two positions on the brutal closing hole.

With three rounds remaining and gaps of just 1-7 points separating the field, this tournament remains wide open. Patterson holds the slimmest of margins, while Baker lurks ominously close and the chasing pack remains well within striking distance.

### How It Unfolded

**Holes 1-6: Baker's Blitz Establishes Early Control**

Jon Baker emerged from the opening six holes with a commanding statement of intent, posting 15 points while the field averaged just 9-10. Alex Baker briefly held the early lead through the second hole before his namesake surged ahead at the par-5 third. Patterson played the steady accumulator through this stretch with 9 points, while Mullin's tournament got off to a nightmare start with just 6 points. The par-4 fifth—the course's toughest hole at an average of 2.8 over par—proved a brutal examination for everyone, setting the tone for a demanding test ahead.

**Holes 7-12: Patterson's Surge Changes Everything**

The middle six holes belonged to Patterson, who detonated for 16 points to completely reshape the leaderboard. The par-5 12th—the course's easiest hole at just 0.4 over par—provided a scoring feast that Patterson exploited ruthlessly. Baker added 12 solid points but felt Patterson's momentum building behind him. Mullin showed signs of recovery with 12 points, while Williams maintained his consistent pace with 11. The foundations of Patterson's eventual victory were being laid hole by hole through this critical stretch.

**Holes 13-18: Patterson Strikes, Mullin Roars Back**

The closing stretch delivered high drama as Patterson posted 14 points in the final six to complete a magnificent 23-point back nine. The defining moment arrived at the 16th, where Patterson seized the lead from Baker for good. Mullin produced the round's most explosive finish with 15 points in the final six—capping his 23-point back nine that dragged him from disaster to contention. Baker managed 11 points in the closing stretch but his 16-point back nine couldn't match the leaders' intensity. The par-4 18th—averaging a brutal 2.4 over par—created final-hole chaos as Williams climbed two positions and Alex Baker dropped two in the standings. Patterson's nerve held firm when it mattered most.

**Green Jacket (Gross):**

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining, everything remains in play.** Patterson's one-point cushion offers virtually no margin for error—Jon Baker needs just a two-point swing over the next three rounds to overtake him, requiring an average difference of less than one point per round. That's barely a single hole's difference over 54 holes of golf.

The real intrigue lies in how tight this field remains. Williams and Mullin sit just six points back, needing to average two points per round better than Patterson—entirely achievable given both showed they can produce big numbers when conditions suit them. Even Alex Baker at seven points back needs only 2.3 points per round better than the leader to force his way back into contention.

The Trophy remains genuinely wide open—no one is out of it, and everyone is vulnerable. Patterson must maintain his consistency while withstanding the pressure of defending a lead that barely exists. Baker will take enormous confidence from his explosive front nine, knowing he has another gear if he can unlock it on the back. Meanwhile, Mullin's comeback narrative could fuel a genuine championship charge if he avoids another slow start. At the other end, no one has built enough of a gap to start worrying about the wooden spoon—yet.

### Round Highlights

- **H16: The Turning Point** – Patterson seizes the lead from Jon Baker with the round's decisive blow
- **H5: The Toughest Test** – The par-4 fifth averaging 2.8 over par separated the field early
- **H12: The Scoring Feast** – Par-5 easiest hole (0.4 over par) provided crucial points for the leaders
- **Mullin's Resurrection** – From 6 points through six holes to 23 on the back nine
- **H18: Closing Chaos** – The brutal finishing hole (2.4 over par) shuffled positions one final time

### Player Summaries

**John PATTERSON:** Balanced brilliance with 16 front/23 back nine points, seized the lead at H16 and held firm through the demanding closer to establish a one-point advantage with rounds to spare.

**Jon BAKER:** Explosive opening six holes (15 points) established early control, but his 16-point back nine couldn't match Patterson's late surge, leaving him one point adrift after leading through H15.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Steady Eddie personified with 15 front/18 back—climbed two positions on the final hole to share third place, never spectacular but always accumulating.

**David MULLIN:** Author of the round's most dramatic arc, stumbled to 6 points through six holes before exploding for 23 on the back nine (15 points in the final six) to salvage a share of third place.

**Alex BAKER:** Led early and showed strength through the middle six (14 points), but dropped two positions on the brutal 18th as his 17-point back nine couldn't match the leaders' intensity.
