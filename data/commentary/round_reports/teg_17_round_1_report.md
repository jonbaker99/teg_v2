## Round Report

## Patterson Surges from Mid-Round to Seize Opening Lead
**Praia D'El Rey • 05/10/2024 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The TEG Trophy burst into life at Praia D'El Rey as John Patterson produced a commanding 39-point Stableford display to edge Jon Baker by a single point after a dramatic opening round. Baker's blistering start—15 points through six holes—looked to have set the template, but Patterson's explosive middle stretch of 16 points flipped the script. With three rounds still to play, both men have established themselves as early frontrunners, though a tightly bunched chasing pack remains within striking distance.

The course showed its teeth early, with the par-4 5th proving the day's toughest examination at an average of 2.8-over-par. Yet it also offered rewards for the bold, particularly at the par-5 12th where the field averaged 2.8 Stableford points. Patterson's ability to capitalize on scoring opportunities whilst limiting damage on the brutish holes proved decisive. The final hole provided late drama as seven scoring events unfolded, with Gregg Williams jumping two positions and Alex Baker tumbling two spots to complete a chaotic closer.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker announced his intentions emphatically over the opening stretch. Fifteen points through six holes—including mastering the treacherous par-4 5th where the field hemorrhaged strokes—gave him an early stranglehold. His front-nine 22 points represented the day's finest opening salvo, and with Patterson posting a modest nine points through the same stretch, Baker appeared poised to pull clear.

But Patterson had other ideas. The middle six holes became his canvas, a 16-point masterclass that swung the momentum decisively. Whilst others struggled to find rhythm, Patterson clicked through the gears, building relentlessly towards the back nine. David Mullin, marooned in the pack after a disastrous six-point start, suddenly found his range with 12 points through the middle section—a hint of the fireworks to come.

The turning point arrived at the par-4 16th. Patterson, carrying 37 points and riding the wave of his mid-round surge, seized the outright lead from Baker. The momentum shift was palpable. Baker, who'd accumulated 22 points on the front nine, could only muster 16 on the return—still solid, but insufficient to hold off Patterson's sustained assault.

The drama crescendoed at the 18th, a brutal closer averaging 2.4-over-par. Seven scoring events in quick succession reshuffled the deck one final time. Gregg Williams, consistent throughout with a 15-18 split, pounced to leap two positions into a tie for third. Alex Baker, who'd battled back from his sluggish nine-point opening with a strong middle stretch, saw his hard work undone as he dropped two spots to fifth. Meanwhile, Mullin—author of the round's most remarkable comeback with 23 back-nine points—surged into a share of third alongside Williams.

Patterson held his nerve, adding 14 points over the final six to post 39 and secure a one-point advantage heading into Saturday's second round.

### Standings After Round 1

**Round 1 Stableford:** J Patterson 39 | J Baker 38 | G Williams 33 | D Mullin 33 | A Baker 32
**Round 1 Gross:** J Patterson +23 | A Baker +26 | J Baker +30 | G Williams +30 | D Mullin +37

**Tournament Stableford:** J Patterson 39 | J Baker 38 | G Williams 33 | D Mullin 33 | A Baker 32
**Tournament Gross:** J Patterson +23 | A Baker +26 | J Baker +30 | G Williams +30 | D Mullin +37

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining**, this is anyone's trophy. Patterson's one-point cushion over Baker amounts to a single dropped shot—hardly insurmountable with 54 holes left to play. Baker will rue his 11-point closing stretch but knows he possesses the firepower to reclaim the lead, needing to average just 40 points per round to reach 158 total. Patterson, meanwhile, must average 39.7 points to hit that same 158-point benchmark.

The chasing pack remains dangerously close. Williams and Mullin, tied on 33 points, sit just six back—roughly two good holes' worth of separation. Each needs to average 41.7 points over the final three rounds to catch the current pace. Even Alex Baker at 32 points (seven adrift) isn't out of it; three 42-point rounds would vault him right back into contention. With Praia D'El Rey showing both fangs and generosity on Friday, expect the leaderboard to remain fluid.

The Green Jacket gross competition mirrors the Stableford battle, with Patterson's 23-over round giving him a three-stroke advantage over Alex Baker. But with scoring unpredictable—the course yielding everything from disastrous blow-ups to bounty at the par-5s—nothing is settled. Saturday's second round will reveal whether Patterson can maintain his authority or whether Baker's explosive scoring ability will tip the balance once more.

### Round Highlights

- Jon Baker's blistering 15-point opening stretch through six holes set the early pace
- John Patterson's 16-point rampage through the middle six holes (H7-12) turned the round
- The par-5 12th proved the field's best friend—easiest hole of the day at 0.4-over-par
- David Mullin's stunning 23-point back nine (after just 10 on the front) marked the round's greatest revival
- Final-hole chaos saw seven scoring events unfold, with Gregg Williams (+2) and Alex Baker (-2) making dramatic late moves

### Player Summaries

**John Patterson:** Methodical brilliance defined Patterson's 39-point opener. A patient nine-point start gave way to a 16-point explosion through the middle six, then he held firm with 14 points over the closing stretch to claim the round and take a slender one-point tournament lead.

**Jon Baker:** Scorched the opening six holes for 15 points and led comfortably at the turn with 22 on the front nine, but couldn't sustain the pace. His 16-point back nine, whilst respectable, allowed Patterson to slip past. Trails by just one point.

**Gregg Williams:** Rock-solid consistency—15 points out, 18 home—kept Williams in the hunt throughout. A smart final-hole score lifted him two spots into a tie for third, six points behind Patterson with everything still to play for.

**David Mullin:** Authored the round's most dramatic recovery. After a catastrophic six-point opening stretch, Mullin roared back with 23 points on the back nine (joint-best of the day) to salvage a tie for third, just six off the lead.

**Alex Baker:** Battled back from a sluggish nine-point start through six holes with a strong 14-point middle section, but the brutal 18th undid his good work. Dropped two positions on the final hole to finish fifth, seven points adrift but still within range.
