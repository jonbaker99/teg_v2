# TEG 5 - Round 1 Report

# Baker's Brilliant Middle Six Steals Opening Salvo
**Boavista • 03/06/2012 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The inaugural round of TEG 5 delivered immediate drama as Jon Baker seized control with a commanding 40-point performance, edging David Mullin by a single point in a gripping contest at Boavista. The lead changed hands three times in the opening three holes before Baker found his rhythm through the middle stretch, reeling off an exceptional 16 points from holes 7-12 to establish a position he wouldn't relinquish.

Mullin, who dominated the opening six holes with 14 points, couldn't quite sustain his blistering pace through the brutal closing stretch, where the par-4 18th proved the hardest hole on the course. Baker's victory in the round Stableford was complemented by a 20-stroke gross performance that sets up an intriguing battle ahead. With three rounds remaining, Baker holds the narrowest of advantages in the Trophy race, while trailing Mullin by nine strokes in the Green Jacket competition.

The gap between first and fifth is just 10 points – eminently catchable over three rounds – suggesting this tournament is far from decided.

### How It Unfolded

**Early Exchanges**

The tournament exploded into life immediately, with the lead changing hands three times in as many holes. Baker briefly seized first position at the par-5 2nd, but Mullin struck back at the 3rd to establish a 7-point total. The opening six holes belonged decisively to Mullin, who amassed 14 points to Baker's 10, building what looked like a commanding position.

Baker's stumble at the difficult par-3 6th – which played 1.8 strokes over par for the field – dropped him two positions down the leaderboard. Meanwhile, Gregg Williams was quietly assembling a solid opening stretch, moving up two spots by the 4th hole as Stuart Neumann struggled early.

**The Turning Point**

Everything changed over the next six holes. Baker produced the round's defining sequence, reeling off 16 points from holes 7-12 while the field consolidated around him. The par-5 8th played generously for everyone (averaging 2.8 Stableford points), but Baker capitalised more effectively than his rivals. The par-3 11th, which proved the easiest hole on the course at 0.6 strokes over par, allowed the entire field to collect points, but Baker's momentum was now unstoppable.

Mullin remained dangerous, adding 14 points of his own through this stretch, but the gap was narrowing with every hole.

**Closing Drama**

Baker reclaimed the lead for good at the par-4 16th, jumping two positions with a strong play that gave him 37 points and put Mullin on notice. The closing stretch was brutal – holes 17 and 18 averaged a combined 4 strokes over par – but Baker held his nerve magnificently. 

The par-4 18th, playing 2.2 strokes over par and yielding just 1.2 Stableford points on average, was where tournaments could unravel. Baker navigated it successfully while Mullin couldn't quite find the heroics needed to force a tie. Baker's 14 points over the final six holes to Mullin's 11 proved the decisive margin, securing victory by a single point in a thrilling opening round.

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Baker's single-point Trophy lead and 10-point spread from first to fifth means this tournament remains wide open. Mullin needs to average just 0.4 points per round better than Baker to claim the TEG Trophy – effectively a tie over three rounds would give him the title. Williams sits four points back, requiring approximately 1.3 points per round more than Baker, a target well within reach given the volatility already on display.

Even Henry Meller, six points adrift in fourth, remains mathematically viable if he can produce 40-point rounds while Baker fades. The critical question is whether Baker can maintain his middle-stretch excellence – that 16-point surge through holes 7-12 won't be easily repeatable, and Mullin's superior gross play (nine strokes better) suggests he has the lower scoring potential.

The Green Jacket race presents a fascinating contrast, with Mullin holding a nine-stroke advantage over Williams. Baker's gross deficit of nine strokes to Mullin means he needs to outscore him by three strokes per round – challenging but achievable. At the other end, Neumann faces the steepest climb, needing to average over three points per round better than Baker just to force a Trophy playoff.

### Round Highlights

- Three lead changes in the opening three holes set immediate tone
- Baker's exceptional 16-point surge through holes 7-12 turned the round
- Par-3 11th played as easiest hole, averaging 0.6 strokes over par
- Critical lead change at 16th as Baker moved to 37 points
- Brutal par-4 18th (2.2 over par average) provided perfect stage for Baker to hold nerve and win by single point

### Player Summaries

**Jon BAKER:** Seized Round 1 with 40 points, highlighted by an exceptional 16-point middle six and a nerveless finish; leads Trophy by one but trails Gross by nine strokes.

**David MULLIN:** Brilliant opening stretch (14 points in first six, 22 on front nine) couldn't quite be sustained through closing holes; one point back in Trophy, leads Gross by nine.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Balanced 18-18 split showed consistency but lacked the fireworks to challenge leaders; four points off Trophy pace with three rounds to play.

**Henry MELLER:** Slow start (11 points first six) before rallying with strong 19-point back nine; six points back but mathematically very much alive.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Struggled throughout with particularly weak closing six (8 points); faces 10-point Trophy deficit that requires immediate turnaround in Round 2.
