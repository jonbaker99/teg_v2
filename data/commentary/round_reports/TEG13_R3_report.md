# TEG 13 - Round 3 Report

## Patterson Lights Up Littlestone as Baker Extends His Grip

**Littlestone • 10/10/2020 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Littlestone on Saturday morning nursing a slender two-point advantage, knowing the field was lurking. What he delivered was a statement round that stretched his lead to five points and left his rivals needing something special in Sunday's finale. His 44-point haul—built on a dominant 24-point front nine—wasn't the day's headline score, but it was exactly what the situation demanded.

That headline belonged to John Patterson, who produced the tournament's best round with a scintillating 49 points to vault from fifth to third. His surge, featuring 17 points across both the opening and middle sixes, answered serious questions after a disappointing 28-point showing in Round 2. Behind them, Gregg Williams posted a solid 40 points to stay within striking distance at five back, while David Mullin and Alex Baker both struggled to 32-point rounds that dropped them out of realistic contention.

The course bit back hard, particularly at the par-4 2nd and 12th holes, where the field averaged 5.6 strokes—a sobering 1.6 over par. Only the par-4 4th, playing to 4.2, offered genuine respite on a day that separated the contenders from the pretenders.

### How It Unfolded

**Early Exchanges**

Patterson came out firing, rattling off 17 points across the opening six holes to serve notice of his intentions. But it was Jon Baker who seized control at the 2nd hole—the day's toughest test—taking the solo lead for the first time as his cumulative total reached 79 points. The par-4 2nd proved a field-wrecker, averaging 5.6 strokes, and Baker's ability to navigate it without major damage spoke volumes about his composure at the head of affairs.

David Mullin kept himself honest with a steady 11-point opening split, but Gregg Williams and Alex Baker both stumbled to 10-point starts that left them scrambling to stay in touch. The 4th hole offered brief relief—the day's easiest at 4.2 strokes—but the damage was done.

**The Middle Six Surge**

If Baker's opening had established control, his middle six holes from 7 through 12 built something approaching dominance. His 17-point haul extended his lead to commanding proportions, even as Patterson matched him point-for-point with his own 17-point burst. Williams responded with 16 points to keep his hopes alive, but the gap was widening with every hole.

The par-4 12th matched the 2nd as co-hardest hole of the day—another 5.6 average that tested everyone's mettle. Baker navigated both with the steady hand of a leader playing within himself. David Mullin's 12 points kept him in fourth, while Alex Baker's second consecutive 10-point split left him drifting toward irrelevance.

**The Closing Drama**

Patterson saved his best for an emphatic finish, posting 15 points across the final six to complete his 49-point masterpiece and grab third place. Williams matched his earlier form with 14 points to cement second position and keep the dream alive. Baker didn't need fireworks—his 12-point closing split was workmanlike, professional, and perfectly calibrated to maintain his five-point cushion heading into Sunday's showdown.

Alex Baker finally found some rhythm with his best split of the day—12 points—but it was too little, too late. Most disappointingly, Mullin faded badly with just nine points down the stretch, his championship challenge effectively over as he dropped to fourth, 19 points adrift.

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:**

Jon Baker controls his destiny but knows five points can evaporate quickly in Stableford scoring. He needs roughly 36-37 points in the final round to secure the TEG Trophy—a score he's bettered in two of three rounds. If he achieves that, Williams would need an extraordinary 41-42 points to catch him, a target that's possible but demanding.

Williams at five back remains the clear danger. His consistent 40-41 point scoring across Rounds 2 and 3 suggests he's capable of the big number needed. He needs to average 40-42 points while hoping Baker stumbles to the mid-30s. It's a realistic scenario—Williams has shown the form, and five points can vanish fast with one bad hole from the leader.

Patterson's 49-point explosion has revived his mathematical chances at 14 back, but he'd need to repeat that heroics while Baker collapses—possible but improbable. More realistically, he's fighting Mullin (19 back) and Alex Baker (22 back) for podium positions, with both now needing miracles to feature in the Trophy race. The Spoon battle remains wide open, with the back markers still to be confirmed for Sunday's finale.

### Round Highlights

- John Patterson's 49-point explosion featuring 17-point bursts across both opening and middle sixes
- Jon Baker's commanding 24-point front nine to seize control and extend his lead
- The par-4 2nd and 12th holes proving joint-toughest at 5.6 strokes average—1.6 over par
- Gregg Williams' resilient 40 points to stay within five and keep pressure on the leader
- David Mullin's late fade—just nine points across the closing six—ending his realistic Trophy hopes

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Dominant 44 points built on exceptional 24-point front nine extends lead to five; averaging 39.7 points through three rounds suggests he's the man to beat heading into Sunday's finale.

**Gregg Williams:** Solid 40 points with strong middle six (16 points) keeps him five back and well within striking distance; needs career round but has shown consistent 40-41 point form.

**John Patterson:** Tournament's best round with scintillating 49 points featuring consistent excellence across all splits (17-17-15); spectacular bounce-back from R2 disappointment vaults him to third but 14 back.

**David Mullin:** Disappointing 32 points as late fade (nine-point closing split) drops him to fourth and 19 back; steady opening (11 points) couldn't be sustained when it mattered most.

**Alex Baker:** Another 32-point round with too-consistent splits (10-10-12) leaves him fifth and 22 back; mathematical chances effectively over despite finally finding rhythm late.
