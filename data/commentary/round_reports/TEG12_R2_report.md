# TEG 12 - Round 2 Report

# Williams Survives Six Lead Changes to Edge Clear

**PGA Catalunya - Tour • 04/10/2019 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams clung to his TEG Trophy lead by the narrowest of margins after a dramatic second round that saw the advantage change hands six times over the closing holes at PGA Catalunya. Williams and John PATTERSON both posted 42 points in a compelling duel, but Williams' superior back nine (23 points to PATTERSON's 21) proved decisive as he now leads by a single point with two rounds remaining.

While the leaders battled, Stuart NEUMANN produced the round of the day with a commanding 44 points—eight better than his opening effort—to surge past Jon BAKER into third place. NEUMANN's blistering start of 15 points through the opening six holes set the tone for a performance that briefly threatened the lead battle before the leaders responded. In the Green Jacket gross competition, Williams also holds a narrow advantage, his +16 total one stroke clear of PATTERSON.

The round's narrative was defined by its volatility at the top, with neither Williams nor PATTERSON able to establish control until the closing stretch.

### How It Unfolded

The early drama belonged entirely to Stuart NEUMANN, who turned the opening six holes into a personal highlight reel with 15 Stableford points. While NEUMANN surged, the overnight leaders Williams and PATTERSON both stuttered to 11-point starts, allowing NEUMANN to briefly imagine himself in contention. By the time the field reached the par-4 4th, PATTERSON had edged ahead of Williams for the first time, only for Williams to immediately snatch it back at the 5th.

The middle six holes saw NEUMANN maintain his extraordinary form with another 17 points, giving him 32 through twelve holes and moving him decisively past Jon BAKER into third place. More significantly, PATTERSON caught fire with 17 points of his own to retake the lead at the par-5 12th, while Williams posted a solid 15 to stay within touching distance. Alex BAKER, who'd opened with a promising 13 points, cooled dramatically with just 10 through this stretch, effectively ending any hopes of climbing the leaderboard.

The final six holes delivered the theatre this tournament demands. At the par-5 15th, six players found themselves embroiled in the scoring chaos, with Williams seizing back the lead in the confusion. PATTERSON struck back immediately at the 16th to regain pole position, setting up a tense finish. The par-4 17th proved decisive—Williams grabbed the lead for the final time, then held his nerve at the last to post his 42-point round. PATTERSON matched the score but couldn't quite overhaul his rival. Behind them, NEUMANN added 14 closing points to secure round honours, while Williams' 16-point finish was the best of the leaders and ultimately the difference.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** SN 44 | GW 42 | JP 42 | DM 40 | AB 37 | JB 36  
**Round 2 Gross:** GW +16 | JB +16 | SN +21 | JP +24 | AB +24 | DM +12

**Tournament Stableford:** GW 88 | JP 87 | SN 80 | JB 76 | DM 75 | AB 71  
**Tournament Gross:** GW +60 | JP +61 | SN +77 | JB +78 | AB +82 | DM +88

### What's At Stake

With two rounds remaining, this tournament is wide open at the top—and deceptively so further down. Williams' single-point advantage is razor-thin: PATTERSON needs to average just 0.5 points more per round to claim the TEG Trophy. In practical terms, a 43-42 finish over the final two rounds would flip the standings. Williams must maintain his current level (42 points per round) to stay ahead, while PATTERSON can afford no slip-ups.

Stuart NEUMANN's explosive 44-point performance keeps him mathematically alive, sitting eight points back in third. He'd need to average 48 points over the final two rounds while hoping the leaders falter—possible but unlikely given their consistency. More realistically, NEUMANN is now in pole position for third place, with Jon BAKER 12 points adrift and needing a similar surge to reclaim the spot.

The battle for the wooden spoon remains Alex BAKER's to lose, though his 37-point recovery in Round 2 shows improvement. He's 17 points behind Williams but would need an average of 50.5 points per round to reach the lead—effectively eliminating him from Trophy contention. David MULLIN, sitting fifth, is 13 points back and faces similar mathematics. The tournament has become a two-horse race for the title, with NEUMANN fighting to secure the podium and the rest playing for pride and position.

### Round Highlights

- Stuart NEUMANN's dominant opening twelve holes: 32 points through the turn, including consecutive six-hole bursts of 15 and 17 points
- Six lead changes between Williams and PATTERSON from hole 4 onwards, with neither able to establish control
- The chaotic par-5 15th involving six players in the scoring drama, where Williams made his crucial penultimate move
- Williams' decisive 16-point finish over the final six holes, his strongest stretch of the round
- The par-4 1st and par-5 15th emerging as the joint toughest holes at +1.83 versus par

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Posted 42 points to match PATTERSON but crucially outscored him on the back nine (23-21) to maintain his lead. Struggled early with 11 points through six holes but finished with authority, posting 16 points over the closing stretch. Holds the narrowest of margins in both TEG Trophy (1 pt) and Green Jacket (+1 stroke).

**John PATTERSON:** Matched the leader's 42 points but couldn't quite edge ahead, involved in all six lead changes down the stretch. His middle-six surge of 17 points briefly gave him control at the 12th, but Williams' superior finish left him one point adrift. Sits perfectly poised just one behind with two rounds to play.

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Round winner with a commanding 44 points, eight better than his opening effort. Dominated the first twelve holes with 32 points before adding 14 over the close. Climbed past Jon BAKER into third but now sits eight points behind Williams, needing near-perfection to threaten the leaders.

**Jon BAKER:** Dropped to fourth after a consistent but insufficient 36 points. Posted 17 on the front and 19 on the back—solid scoring that couldn't match NEUMANN's surge. Now 12 points behind Williams and facing an uphill battle to reclaim third place.

**David MULLIN:** The model of consistency with 40 points split 14-14-12 across three six-hole segments. Held fifth position but sits 13 points off the lead, effectively playing for final position rather than tournament victory.

**Alex BAKER:** Tale of two nines with 14 points on the front before recovering to 23 on the back for 37 total. Improved from his opening 34 points but remains rooted to sixth, 17 points behind Williams and mathematically eliminated from trophy contention.
