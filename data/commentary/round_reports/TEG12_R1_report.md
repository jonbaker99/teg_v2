# TEG 12 - Round 1 Report

## Williams Takes Opening Salvo in Six-Way Battle for Glory
**PGA Catalunya - Tour • 03/10/2019 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The 12th TEG Trophy burst into life on Catalonia's challenging Tour course with a breathless opening round that saw the lead change hands six times before Gregg Williams emerged victorious with 46 Stableford points. The day belonged to Williams and John Patterson, who staged a magnificent duel through the closing holes, but it was Williams who held his nerve over the brutal finishing stretch to claim a slender one-point advantage heading into Friday's second round.

Patterson's electrifying middle-six stretch of 21 points - the tournament's best - briefly looked decisive as he surged clear at the 11th, but Williams responded with the composure of a champion. The lead swapped between them three times over the final seven holes before Williams sealed victory with a composed finish at the 18th. Behind the leading pair, Jon Baker's steady 40 points secured third place, while the chasing pack remains tightly bunched with Stuart Neumann, David Mullin, and Alex Baker all within 12 points of the summit.

### How It Unfolded

The early exchanges belonged to David Mullin, who seized the first lead at the second hole with four points to his name. But the par-4 fourth - destined to become the day's most punishing test at three strokes over par average - triggered the first significant shake-up. Williams posted 10 points through four holes to grab the lead, while Mullin's position crumbled with a position drop that would prove costly.

Williams appeared to be settling into a commanding rhythm through holes five to ten, building his advantage while Patterson lurked ominously just behind. The seventh and eighth holes provided rare respite on this demanding layout, both playing half a stroke under par, and Patterson seized his moment. An explosive 21-point burst across the middle six holes - anchored by his dominance of those easier passages - catapulted him to the front at the 11th with 29 points on his card.

**The Final Stretch Drama**

What followed was edge-of-the-seat theatre. Williams refused to buckle, matching Patterson stride for stride as they navigated the treacherous par-4 14th together. At 37 points total, Williams reclaimed the lead, only for Patterson to fire straight back with a crucial gain at the 15th - the par-5 playing as the day's second-hardest hole at 2.67 strokes over par - to regain pole position at 39 points.

The pendulum had swung six times, but Williams saved his best for last. A composed approach over the closing three holes yielded 15 points for the day, enough to pip Patterson's strong 14-point finish and claim the Round 1 spoils by the narrowest of margins. When the dust settled, Williams stood on 46 points with Patterson breathing down his neck on 45, while Baker's quietly consistent 40-point effort secured third place, six adrift of the lead.

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining:**

Williams leads the TEG Trophy by just one point, but here's the reality: nobody is out of it. In Stableford golf, where a single inspired round can yield 50+ points, even last-placed Alex Baker trails by only 12 points - barely four points per round to make up. This tournament is wide open.

The key battleground is between Williams and Patterson. With both men capable of mid-40s scores, Williams needs to average around 40-42 points per round to protect his lead, while Patterson requires marginal improvement - perhaps 43 points per round - to overhaul him. But Baker, despite sitting third, demonstrated the consistency that wins tournaments with balanced 19 and 21-point halves. He needs approximately 45 points per round to challenge for victory.

The dark horses are circling. Neumann's explosive middle-six performance (16 points) proves he can go low when dialled in, while Mullin's early dominance before fading suggests the quality is there if he can maintain it for 18 holes. Even Alex Baker, despite his slow start costing him dearly, showed improvement with an 18-point back nine. In the Green Jacket race, both Alex Baker and Williams share the gross lead at +12, keeping that secondary competition intriguingly balanced. With 54 holes remaining, expect position changes at every turn.

### Round Highlights
- Six lead changes create opening-round drama rarely seen in tournament golf
- John Patterson's 21-point middle-six rampage - the day's most explosive stretch
- The par-4 fourth hole emerges as a potential tournament-defining monster at three strokes over par
- Gregg Williams' nerveless 15-point closing run to seal victory by one
- Perfect scoring balance from Williams: 23 points on both front and back nines

### Player Summaries
