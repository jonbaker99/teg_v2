# TEG 6 - Round 3 Report

## NEUMANN SURGES AS WILLIAMS HOLDS FIRM IN BRUTAL MIDDLE SIX

**El Prat - Rosa • 23/09/2013 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

With one round remaining and a seven-point cushion to defend, Gregg Williams faced his sternest test yet at El Prat's Rosa course. While Stuart Neumann claimed round honours with a composed 36-point performance to vault into third place, the real story unfolded in the battle between leader and challenger. Williams responded to Jon Baker's brilliant 15-point closing surge with a 13-point finish of his own, maintaining his seven-point advantage heading into the final round.

The middle six holes—particularly the brutal par-4 8th where the field averaged 3.6 over par—separated the contenders from the pretenders. David Mullin's title hopes evaporated with a six-point collapse over the final holes, dropping him from third to fourth, while Henry Meller's middle-six meltdown saw last round's 41-point heroics become a distant memory.

The TEG Trophy remains Williams' to lose, but Baker's closing statement—the best six-hole finish of the tournament—ensures Sunday's final round will deliver drama.

### How It Unfolded

Stuart Neumann set the tone early, racing to 13 points through the opening six holes with Jon Baker matching him stride for stride. The par-3 6th, playing as the easiest hole at 0.8 over par, allowed the field to bank points before the course bared its teeth.

Holes seven through twelve became the day's defining stretch. The par-4 8th proved a monster, averaging 3.6 over par and yielding just 0.8 Stableford points per player. Henry Meller's challenge disintegrated here, managing only six points across these six holes—including disaster at the 11th where the field averaged 2.4 over par. Baker stumbled too, posting just seven points in this brutal middle section. Only Neumann and Williams emerged unscathed, both carding 10 points to maintain their momentum.

The final six holes delivered contrasting fortunes. Baker, seven points adrift starting the stretch, produced the tournament's best closing performance with 15 points—a statement of intent for the final round. Williams, sensing danger, responded immediately with 13 points of his own to slam the door shut. Neumann matched Williams' 13-point finish to complete a perfectly balanced 18-18 split and claim third place.

David Mullin's title aspirations crumbled over these final holes. After posting a solid 12 points through the opening six, his six-point finish—the weakest of anyone in contention—saw him slip behind Neumann and out of realistic contention. The defending champion's nine-point drop from his Round 2 performance of 37 points proved the round's most damaging collapse.

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:** Gregg Williams holds a commanding but not insurmountable seven-point lead over Jon Baker in the TEG Trophy race. Williams needs only to average his tournament form—33 points per round—to secure the title. Even a modest 30-point final round would require Baker to post 37 points to catch him, a score only Henry Meller has achieved this week.

Baker's 15-point closing surge demonstrates he has the firepower to mount a challenge, but he needs Williams to falter significantly. A 38-point performance coupled with a Williams collapse below 31 points would force a tie. More realistically, Baker's goal is to pressure Williams into mistakes while posting his own season-best round.

Stuart Neumann sits 10 points back in third—mathematically alive but needing a miracle scenario involving both leaders stumbling. His consistent 36-point round suggests he's found form at the right time, making him a threat if the leaders exchange blows. David Mullin, 15 points adrift, and Henry Meller, 20 back, are effectively eliminated from TEG Trophy contention barring unprecedented collapses ahead of them.

In the Green Jacket race, David Mullin's 15-stroke advantage over Baker remains comfortable despite his poor round, though Baker's momentum could make the final round interesting.
