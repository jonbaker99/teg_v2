## Round Report

## Williams Surges But Baker Holds On After Lead Changes at Prince's
**Prince's - Dunes/Himalayas • 09/10/2020 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Coming into Round 2, Jon Baker held a slender six-point advantage over Gregg Williams, with four players bunched within eight points at the top of the leaderboard. The battle for the TEG Trophy hung in the balance, and Williams had other ideas about letting Baker extend his lead. In a dramatic afternoon on the Kent coast, Williams fired the round of the tournament so far with 41 Stableford points, temporarily seizing the lead at the 15th hole before Baker responded with a gutsy finish to reclaim top spot by a single point.

The round featured two brutal disaster holes that set a punishing tone, but Williams thrived in the adversity with a stunning back-nine surge of 24 points. Baker held his nerve with 36 points of his own, maintaining his overnight lead despite the sustained pressure. David Mullin continues his steady climb into contention with 37 points, while Alex Baker's front-loaded performance saw him slip from joint-third to fourth as his challenge faded on the inward half.

### How It Unfolded

The opening hole immediately separated pretenders from contenders, playing two strokes over par as the field wrestled with the Dunes/Himalayas combination. Alex Baker emerged from the carnage with the best start, collecting 14 points across the first six holes while Baker and Mullin posted steady 13s. Williams, plotting his assault, managed a respectable opening stretch despite what would prove to be merely a warm-up.

**The Turning Point**

The middle section transformed the tournament. Williams found his rhythm with 13 points from holes 7-12, building dangerous momentum while John Patterson enjoyed his finest spell with 16 points. The par-3 eighth provided brief respite as the easiest hole of the day, but the par-4 ninth matched the first hole's brutality, averaging two over par and claiming multiple victims.

**Down the Stretch**

Everything exploded on the closing stretch. Williams unleashed a spectacular 16 points over the final six holes, his back-nine total of 24 points representing a complete transformation from his steady 17-point front nine. At the par-4 15th, Williams struck decisively to seize the outright lead on 67 points, overtaking Baker for the first time all day.

But Baker, showing the composure that has defined his season, refused to buckle. With Mullin also applying pressure through a strong 21-point back nine, Baker ground out 13 crucial points over the closing holes. At the 18th, he delivered when it mattered most, reclaiming the lead to finish on 75 points—just one ahead of Williams' 74.

### Standings After Round 2

**Round 2 Stableford:** GW 41 | DM 37 | JB 36 | AB 34 | JP 28  
**Round 2 Gross:** GW +14 | JB +16 | DM +17 | AB +27 | JP +33

**Tournament Stableford:** JB 75 | GW 74 | DM 68 | AB 65 | JP 56  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +48 | JB +55 | GW +61 | AB +88 | JP +108

### What's At Stake

**With two rounds remaining**, this tournament has tightened into a genuine two-horse race for the TEG Trophy, though Mullin hasn't entirely given up the ghost. Williams has closed to within a single point and needs to average just one more point per round than Baker to claim the title—entirely achievable given his 41-point masterclass today. Baker, meanwhile, needs to maintain his consistency; averaging 37-38 points over the final two rounds should be enough if Williams reverts to his opening 33-point form.

Mullin sits seven points back in third and faces a mathematical challenge requiring him to gain 3-4 points per round on the leader while hoping Baker falters. It's a tall order but not impossible—his 37-point round today proves he's capable of the scoring required. Alex Baker's 10-point deficit appears increasingly insurmountable without a dramatic collapse from those ahead, while Patterson needs a minor miracle, sitting 19 points adrift.

The Green Jacket race tells a different story, with Mullin's superior ball-striking giving him a seven-stroke advantage over Baker in the gross competition. Williams trails by 13 strokes in the Jacket race, meaning the two competitions could well crown different champions.

### Round Highlights
- Williams' stunning 24-point back nine included a decisive move at the 15th to temporarily take the lead
- Baker's nerveless 18th-hole response to reclaim the TEG Trophy lead by a single point
- Brutal opening conditions with holes 1 and 9 both averaging two over par
- Patterson's erratic brilliance: 7 points on holes 1-6, 16 on holes 7-12, then just 5 on the closing stretch
- Mullin's 13-point finish from holes 13-18 keeps him firmly in the hunt

### Player Summaries
**Jon Baker:** Ground out 36 points with even 18-point splits on each nine to protect his overnight lead, now ahead by just one point with two rounds to play.

**Gregg Williams:** The 41-point round winner with a magnificent 24-point back nine briefly took the lead at the 15th but couldn't quite sustain it, sitting one back heading into the weekend.

**David Mullin:** Posted 37 points with a strong 21-point back nine to hold third place, seven points behind but leading the Green Jacket race by seven strokes.

**Alex Baker:** Started brilliantly with 21 points on the front nine but faded to 13 coming home, dropping to fourth and now 10 points off the pace.

**John Patterson:** Wildly inconsistent 28 points kept him in fifth, his brilliant middle section (16 points on holes 7-12) sandwiched between struggles at both ends.
