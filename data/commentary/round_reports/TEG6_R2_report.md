# TEG 6 - Round 2 Report

## Meller's Middle-Six Masterclass Shakes Up Chase

**Costa Brava • 22/09/2013 • Round 2 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams arrived at Costa Brava nursing a commanding 9-point cushion after his Round 1 masterclass, but found himself under pressure from a field refusing to surrender. Henry Meller produced the round of the tournament so far with 41 Stableford points—a 10-point improvement on his opening effort—to claim Round 2 honours and vault into fourth place. Williams held his nerve despite a 12-point drop from his opening heroics, posting 36 points to maintain his 9-point advantage at the tournament's halfway point.

David Mullin's late surge kept him in striking distance in third, while Jon Baker's steady 36 points preserved second place. With two rounds remaining and gaps still catchable, the Trophy battle remains wide open, even as Williams' consistency suggests a leader unwilling to crack.

### How It Unfolded

The opening six holes offered little indication of the fireworks to come. Williams and Stuart Neumann both posted 13 points to establish early control, while Meller, Baker, and Mullin all managed respectable 11-point starts. The field remained bunched, suggesting a war of attrition rather than a dramatic shootout.

Everything changed at the seventh hole. Meller ignited a stretch that would define not just his round, but potentially the entire tournament. Across holes 7 through 12—the treacherous middle section of Costa Brava—Meller accumulated an astonishing 18 points. The surge transformed his tournament position, turning a distant fifth-place standing into genuine contention. Baker responded gamely with 13 points across the same stretch, while Williams matched it to protect his advantage. But Neumann's 12 points couldn't hold the pace, and the consistent performer from Round 1 began sliding backwards.

The drama intensified over the closing six. Mullin, sensing opportunity, charged home with 15 points—the best finishing stretch of any player. His late rally kept him within 10 points of Williams and very much alive. Meller and Baker both managed solid 12-point closes to consolidate their positions. Williams, perhaps feeling the weight of expectation, stumbled to 10 points across the final stretch—his weakest six-hole segment of the round. Yet the cushion he'd built in Round 1 proved sufficient. The leader wobbled but never truly buckled, and his 9-point advantage remained intact.

### What's At Stake

**With 2 rounds remaining:**

The mathematics are straightforward but unforgiving. Williams needs to average just 31 points per round to reach the critical 146-point mark that would force second-placed Baker to average an unlikely 36 points in both remaining rounds. Baker himself sits 9 back—a single exceptional round could halve that deficit, but he needs Williams to crack. Mullin, 10 points adrift in third, requires sustained excellence: 38 points per round would reach 150, but only if Williams averages a pedestrian 32 or less.

The real intrigue lies in positions three through five, separated by just 3 points. Meller's momentum makes him dangerous—if he can reproduce his 41-point heroics, he'll leapfrog into medal contention. Neumann's slide from fourth to fifth despite improving his score tells its own cautionary tale: standing still means falling backwards in this field. The leader needs consistency; the chasers need perfection. And with Costa Brava's notorious par-3 third and par-4 eighth proving brutal (both averaging +1.8 versus par), surviving those hazards could determine who closes the gap and who falls away.

### Round Highlights

- Meller's devastating 18-point blitz across holes 7-12 announces him as a genuine contender
- Williams maintains composure despite 12-point drop from Round 1 dominance
- Mullin's 15-point closing surge (holes 13-18) keeps him within striking distance
- Three players tied at 36-37 points shows field compression despite leader's cushion
- Neumann's position swap with Meller despite improving score highlights brutal competition

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Posted 36 points—down 12 from his opening statement—but protected his lead with enough consistency when it mattered most. Nine-point cushion intact but closing stretch wobble (10 pts) will concern him heading into the final two rounds.

**Jon Baker:** Solid 36-point effort maintains second place but doesn't close the gap on Williams. His 13-point middle-six prevented Meller from overtaking him, showing defensive resilience if not attacking brilliance.

**David Mullin:** Matched his Round 1 score exactly (37 points) with a stronger finish—15 points across the final six holes demonstrates closing power. Ten points off the lead with two to play keeps him mathematically alive.

**Henry Meller:** Round 2 champion with 41 points powers him from fifth to fourth. His 18-point middle-six rampage was the tournament's standout stretch so far, and his 10-point improvement suggests upward trajectory.

**Stuart Neumann:** Improved 3 points to 37 yet dropped from fourth to fifth—the cruel reality of midfield compression. Consistent across all three six-hole segments (13-12-12) but lacked the explosive stretch needed to hold position.
