# TEG 14 - Round 1 Report

## Mullin Surges Late to Seize Opening Lead at Royal Cinque Ports
**Royal Cinque Ports • 04/11/2021 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

David Mullin stormed through the back nine at Royal Cinque Ports to claim both the opening round and early tournament lead with 40 Stableford points. After a modest start left him trailing Alex Baker's blistering opening salvo, Mullin found his rhythm through the middle six and unleashed a dominant 24-point back nine that saw him snatch the lead at the 16th and never look back.

Baker's tournament began in spectacular fashion—14 points through the first six holes had him controlling proceedings—but he couldn't sustain the pace as Mullin's relentless accumulation eventually wore him down. The three-point gap tells the story: Baker still sits second, but Mullin's finishing power has established him as the man to catch.

Jon Baker's round was a tale of two nines. A disastrous opening stretch of just five points left him marooned in last place, but a gutsy middle-six recovery (13 points, best in the field) proved there's fight in the veteran yet. Gregg Williams played the percentage game throughout, banking a solid 33 points with a particularly strong 20-point back nine that keeps him well within striking distance.

### How It Unfolded

The tournament burst into life through Royal Cinque Ports' opening stretch, where Alex Baker looked untouchable. Fourteen points through six holes—the kind of start that builds insurmountable leads—had him five points clear of the field and threatening to make this a procession. While Baker was scorching the front six, Jon Baker was enduring the polar opposite experience: just five points from the same stretch left him staring at an eleven-point deficit before the round was even half done.

The critical shift came through holes seven through twelve. Mullin quietly posted the field's best six-hole stretch with 15 points, closing the gap on Alex Baker while building momentum that would prove decisive. More dramatically, Jon Baker found something approaching his best form with 13 points—a recovery that at least kept mathematical hope alive. Alex Baker's 12 points through this stretch weren't poor, but they weren't enough to extend his lead.

What had been brewing through the middle six exploded across the final stretch. Mullin unleashed 14 points through holes 13-18 to complete a devastating 24-point back nine, the best closing stretch of the day. The pivotal moment came at the 16th, where Mullin finally nosed ahead of Alex Baker. Once in front, he never wobbled.

Behind the leaders, Gregg Williams posted his own impressive 13-point finish, banking 20 points across the back nine that makes him a genuine threat with three rounds remaining. Alex Baker's 11-point close wasn't disastrous, but watching the lead slip away will sting. For Jon Baker, 11 points on the final six kept him in the tournament, but that opening stretch has left him with serious ground to recover.

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining:**

David Mullin's three-point cushion is far from secure. At 40 points, he's averaging the kind of scoring that wins tournaments, but Royal Cinque Ports has plenty of bite left. Alex Baker sits just three back—entirely catchable—and has proven he possesses the firepower to post big numbers, at least over six-hole stretches. If Baker can find consistency across eighteen holes rather than front-loading his scoring, he's the obvious threat.

Gregg Williams at seven back remains mathematically dangerous. He'll need to average around 42 points per round to catch Mullin if the leader maintains his opening form—challenging but not impossible given his strong 20-point back nine suggests he's building toward something. The critical factor: Williams played the steadiest round of the four, suggesting he might be the most reliable accumulator over the marathon distance.

Jon Baker's eleven-point deficit is serious but not catastrophic. His middle-six recovery (13 points, best in the field for that stretch) proves he can still hurt the field when clicking. However, he needs immediate improvement—likely 43+ points next round—to stay relevant, and he cannot afford another slow start. Three rounds is time enough for heroics, but the margin for error has evaporated.

### Round Highlights
- Alex Baker's explosive 14-point opening six holes establishes early dominance before fading
- Jon Baker's disastrous five-point start digs himself into deep trouble through the front six
- David Mullin's 15-point middle six (holes 7-12) shifts momentum away from Alex Baker
- Mullin seizes lead at the 16th with relentless back-nine pressure
- Gregg Williams banks 20 points across the back nine to position himself as dark horse threat

### Player Summaries

**David Mullin:** Controlled the crucial moments when it mattered, posting the day's best score with 40 Stableford points and 15 gross. After a patient opening six (11 points), he unleashed a devastating 24-point back nine to snatch the lead and establish himself as the early favourite for both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket.

**Alex Baker:** Started like a champion with 14 points through six holes but couldn't maintain the blistering pace, eventually surrendering the lead at the 16th. Sits three back in the Stableford race but falls to fourth in gross scoring (+26), suggesting inconsistency that could prove costly.

**Gregg Williams:** The model of steady accumulation, banking 33 points without fanfare but keeping himself firmly in contention. His strong 20-point back nine (13 on the final six) positions him as a genuine threat if the leaders falter, and he leads the Green Jacket race on gross scores.

**Jon Baker:** A round of dramatic extremes—disastrous five-point opening six left him last, but a gutsy 13-point middle stretch (best in field) showed his class. Eleven points back means the deficit is serious, but three rounds offers time for recovery if he can avoid another slow start.
