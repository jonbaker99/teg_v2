# TEG 3 - Round 1 Report

## Baker Seizes Opening-Day Initiative at Boavista
**Boavista • 05/10/2010 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker fired a commanding 45-point opening salvo to seize control of TEG Trophy 3, establishing an eight-point cushion over David Mullin in the Stableford standings. The round delivered early drama when Mullin briefly wrestled the lead away at the sixth, only for Baker to respond immediately and then pull clear with a devastating 17-point closing stretch—the best finish in the field. Baker also leads the secondary Green Jacket competition at 19-over-par gross, two clear of Mullin's 17-over.

The Boavista layout proved a stern test, with the par-4 17th emerging as the day's monster hole, averaging 2.8 shots over par and producing five significant moments. Henry Meller recovered from an early stumble to post 33 points for third, while Stuart Neumann (32) and Gregg Williams (31) remain within striking distance heading into Tuesday's second round.

### How It Unfolded

Baker made his intentions clear from the outset, racing to 14 points through six holes with Mullin matching him stride for stride. The easy par-5 third—averaging just 0.4 over par across the field—proved Mullin's first wobble, as he dropped two positions. He fought back immediately at the fourth, clawing back those places and setting up a fascinating battle through the middle of the front nine.

The sixth hole exploded into life with eight significant events, culminating in Mullin seizing the lead for the first time. But Baker's response was immediate and emphatic. At the seventh, he reclaimed top spot and never looked back, pouring on the pressure through the middle six holes with a field-best 14-point surge. Mullin stayed in touch with a solid 12 points through that stretch, while Meller finally found his rhythm after a sluggish 10-point opening six.

The championship took decisive shape over the closing stretch. Baker turned the screws with an exceptional 17-point finish, including crucial scoring at the treacherous par-4 17th—the hardest hole on the course—which produced five dramatic moments as the field navigated its 2.8-over-par average. The tension carried through to the 18th with four more significant swings. While Mullin closed steadily with 11 points, Williams fell away badly with just seven in the final six, and Neumann managed only 10. Baker's 23-point front nine and 22-point back nine showcased the balance that could prove crucial over four rounds.

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Baker's eight-point advantage is significant but far from decisive over 54 holes. At his opening-round pace of 45 points, he'd finish on 180 for the tournament—meaning Mullin would need to average 48 points per round to catch him, a demanding but not impossible target. More realistically, if Baker maintains a solid 38-point average, Mullin needs approximately 41 points per round to close the gap. That's achievable given his 37-point opening, but it requires immediate improvement.

The battle for third looks wide open. Just four points separate Meller in third from Williams in fifth, with Neumann sandwiched between them. Any of this trio averaging 35-36 points could challenge Mullin for second, while all three remain mathematically capable of overhauling Baker if he stumbles. The Green Jacket competition tells a similar story—Baker's two-shot gross advantage provides breathing room but hardly guarantees the secondary prize. The hardest truth: Baker doesn't need to be brilliant over the next three rounds, just consistent. His challengers need something special.

### Round Highlights

- Baker's wire-to-wire dominance only briefly interrupted by Mullin's sixth-hole surge
- The par-4 17th living up to its brutal reputation with drama at 2.8 over par average
- Mullin's fighting recovery at the fourth after his par-5 third stumble
- Baker's explosive 17-point closing six to put daylight between himself and the field
- Williams' late collapse with just seven points in the final stretch

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Commanding 45-point opening round (19-over gross) featured near-perfect balance with 23/22 front-back splits and a crushing 17-point finish to establish an eight-point lead in both Trophy and Jacket competitions.

**David Mullin:** Posted 37 points (17-over) to hold second, eight back, with a strong 21-point front nine before fading to 16 on the back; briefly led at the sixth but couldn't sustain the challenge against Baker's relentless pace.

**Henry Meller:** Recovered from a sluggish 10-point opening six to post 33 points (28-over) for third place, 12 behind, with improving 12-11 splits through the middle and closing stretches keeping him in mathematical contention.

**Stuart Neumann:** Steady 32-point effort (22-over) sits 13 back in fourth after consistent 11-11 scoring through the first 12 holes, though his 10-point finish leaves work to do in catching the leaders.

**Gregg Williams:** Matched the leaders through 12 holes with 12-12 splits but a poor seven-point closing six left him on 31 points (35-over) in fifth, 14 behind Baker but still within range with three rounds to play.
