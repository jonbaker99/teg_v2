## Round Report

# Williams Claims TEG Trophy as Neumann Storms to Runner-Up Spot
**Oitavos Dunes • 18/10/2022 • Round 4 of 4**

### Round Summary

Gregg Williams sealed the TEG 15 Trophy with a commanding 21-point victory at Oitavos Dunes, but the final-round fireworks belonged to Stuart Neumann. Starting the day in fifth position, Neumann produced an explosive 36-point performance to rocket into second place overall, leaving former runner-up John Patterson in his wake.

Williams never looked threatened, maintaining his lead from start to finish with a solid 34-point round that included a dominant 14-point closing stretch. The victory margin told the story of a tournament controlled from the front, even as Neumann's stunning comeback—featuring 15 points in the opening six holes alone—provided the day's most compelling narrative. The championship ended in chaos at the par-4 18th, where the field averaged 7.5 strokes in a fitting finale to a challenging Portuguese test.

### How It Unfolded

Stuart Neumann came out firing with the best six-hole start of the entire tournament. While the field battled the brutal opening hole—averaging three over par—Neumann found his rhythm immediately, racking up 15 points through the first six. By the turn, he'd posted 21 points on the front nine, transforming his tournament prospects and mounting an unlikely charge from fifth place into podium contention.

Williams, starting with a comfortable cushion, played the percentage game. His steady 10-point front nine wasn't spectacular, but it didn't need to be. David Mullin's early struggles—just six points through the opening stretch—effectively ended any lingering threat to Williams's coronation. Patterson, starting the round in second, posted respectable numbers but couldn't generate the magic needed to challenge the leader.

The middle six holes saw the established order reassert itself briefly. Williams ground out another 10 points, while Neumann kept the momentum rolling with 12 more. Alex Baker produced the round's best middle-six performance with 13 points, but from sixth position it came too late to matter in the final standings.

Williams saved his best for last. A 14-point surge through the closing stretch—the strongest finish of any player—put the seal on his championship triumph. Patterson rallied with 12 points of his own to secure third place overall, but Neumann's earlier heroics had already locked up the runner-up spot. The tournament ended with theatre at the par-4 18th, where the entire field imploded to an average of 3.5 over par—just half a point per player on the hardest hole of the round.

### Standings After Round 4

**Round 4 Stableford:** SN 36 | GW 34 | JP 30 | JB 30 | AB 28 | DM 22  
**Round 4 Gross:** GW +20 | JB +23 | SN +28 | AB +32 | DM +33 | JP +34

**Final Stableford Standings:** GW 157 | SN 136 | JP 131 | JB 131 | DM 128 | AB 121  
**Final Gross Standings:** GW +93 | JB +100 | SN +139 | JP +145 | DM +148 | AB +156

### What's At Stake

**The championship is decided.** Gregg Williams is your TEG 15 Trophy champion by a decisive 21-point margin, a victory built on consistency across all four rounds and never seriously challenged in the final 18. His ability to post 34 points when it mattered—particularly that commanding 14-point finish—demonstrated championship mettle.

The real story lies in the runner-up drama. Neumann's sensational 36-point performance vaulted him from fifth to second, overtaking both Patterson and Baker who'd held podium positions for most of the tournament. Patterson and Jon Baker finished deadlocked on 131 points for third, while Mullin's disappointing 22-point finale dropped him from the podium to fifth overall. Alex Baker's improved round couldn't overcome his earlier struggles, finishing sixth but with momentum heading into the next TEG event.

Williams also claims the Green Jacket gross competition, 93 strokes ahead of the field across four rounds—a dominant display in both formats that leaves no doubt about the worthiness of his double triumph.

### Round Highlights
- Stuart Neumann's explosive 15-point opening six holes—the best six-hole split of the tournament
- Gregg Williams's clinical 14-point closing stretch to seal championship victory
- Carnage at the 18th hole: field averaged 7.5 strokes (3.5 over par) for just 0.5 points each
- David Mullin's collapse from podium position with disappointing 22-point round
- Alex Baker's strong middle-six performance (13 points) showing glimpses of form

### Player Summaries

**Gregg Williams:** Champion's finish with 34 points seals 21-point trophy victory and Green Jacket double. Balanced 16-point front nine and commanding 18-point back nine showed championship composure when it mattered.

**Stuart Neumann:** Stunning round-winning 36 points rockets him from fifth to runner-up. The 21-point front nine—best of the tournament—proved the difference, with that explosive 15-point opening stretch setting the tone.

**John Patterson:** Solid 30-point effort couldn't prevent the slip from second to third overall. The steady 15-15 split represented consistency but lacked the fireworks needed to hold off Neumann's charge.

**Jon Baker:** Another 30-point round maintains fourth position in final standings. The 16-14 split showed reliability across the round, finishing level with Patterson on 131 points but losing on countback.

**David Mullin:** Disappointing 22-point finale drops him from third to fifth in cruel final-round reversal. The poor 12-10 split—18 points down on his previous round—cost him a podium finish.

**Alex Baker:** Improved 28-point performance (up from 29 in round three) shows progress, but sixth place finish reflects earlier tournament struggles. That strong 13-point middle six hints at better form developing.
