## Round Report

## Neumann Seizes Early Initiative After Wild Opening Day
**Oitavos Dunes • 07/10/2023 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The 16th TEG Trophy burst into life at Oitavos Dunes with three lead changes in as many holes and a brutal Portuguese examination that saw just one player conquer the conditions. Stuart Neumann emerged from the chaos with a commanding 39-point performance to lead by five after round one, but not before the lead changed hands at the 4th, 5th, and 6th holes in a frenetic opening act.

With three rounds remaining, Neumann's wire-to-wire display—after reclaiming the lead at the par-4 6th—sets the early standard in both competitions. He shares the Green Jacket lead on 26 strokes with Jon Baker and Gregg Williams, who both posted solid 34-point rounds to sit joint-second in the Trophy alongside Williams. David Mullin lurks one further back on 33 points after a rollercoaster debut, while Alex Baker endured a difficult start on 29 points. The course bared its teeth throughout, particularly on a brutal closing stretch that yielded nine disasters across the final two holes alone.

### How It Unfolded

The opening hole set an ominous tone. Averaging 2.0 strokes over par, it announced that Oitavos Dunes would offer no quarter. Yet Stuart Neumann answered immediately, building a commanding 15-point cushion through the opening six holes while David Mullin matched his intensity with 14 points of his own.

But this tournament refused to follow a simple script. At the par-4 4th, Gregg Williams surged into the lead, only to be displaced one hole later when Mullin jumped two positions to seize control. The decisive moment arrived at the 6th, where four separate events unfolded and Neumann reclaimed the lead he would never relinquish.

**The Middle Section Carnage**

What followed was mayhem. Back-to-back par 5s at the 7th and 8th—holes that should yield birdies—played as nightmares, averaging 2.6 and 2.2 strokes over par respectively. Eight combined disasters left scorecards in tatters. Neumann somehow navigated the carnage with 13 points across holes 7-12, while Mullin's promising start evaporated with just seven points in the same stretch.

Alex Baker's round became a study in volatility. Up three positions at the 10th, down three at the 11th, then up three again at the 13th—his scorecard swung wildly while never threatening the lead. Meanwhile, Jon Baker played the patient game, staying steady through the middle section before making his move.

**The Brutal Conclusion**

Baker's charge came home with authority: 12 points in the final six holes, including a crucial two-position jump at the 14th that carried him to joint-second. Mullin recovered his composure with an identical 12-point finish, but the damage from his middle-section collapse left him fourth. The course saved its cruelest examination for last—the par-4 17th averaged 2.8 strokes over par and generated four disasters, while the 18th yielded five more. Only the brief respite of the 15th hole, matching the 2nd as the day's easiest, offered any relief.

Through it all, Neumann never wavered. His balanced 20-point front nine and 19-point back nine displayed the consistency that has opened a significant early gap.

### Standings After Round 1

**Round 1 Stableford:** SN 39 | JB 34 | GW 34 | DM 33 | AB 29

**Round 1 Gross:** JB +21 | GW +18 | DM +23 | SN +26 | AB +42

**Tournament Stableford:** SN 39 | JB 34 | GW 34 | DM 33 | AB 29

**Tournament Gross:** JB +21 | GW +18 | DM +23 | SN +26 | AB +42

### What's At Stake

**With three rounds remaining:** Neumann's five-point advantage is substantial but far from insurmountable. History suggests the leader needs to average 32-33 points per round to hold off challengers, a mark well within reach given his 39-point opener. However, three rounds offer ample opportunity for momentum shifts—today's three lead changes in three holes proved that much.

For the joint-second duo of Baker and Williams, the mathematics are clear: averaging 35 points per round would likely close the gap, but they'll need Neumann to stumble. Both showed they can handle Oitavos Dunes, with Williams' perfectly balanced 17-17 split suggesting consistency, while Baker's strong finish (18 points on the back nine) indicates he's found his rhythm when it matters most.

Mullin remains dangerous despite his middle-section meltdown. Six points back with three rounds to play means he needs to find approximately 35 points per round while hoping for a 32-point average from Neumann—not impossible given his 14-point opening six and 12-point closing stretch showed his ceiling. Alex Baker faces the steepest climb at 10 points back, requiring near-perfect golf and significant help from those ahead.

In the Green Jacket race, Baker and Williams lead on gross scores, with Neumann four strokes back—a completely different battle that could yet produce a separate champion.

### Round Highlights
- Three lead changes in three holes (H4-H6) set frenetic early pace
- Back-to-back par 5 disasters at H7-H8 averaging 2.6 and 2.2 over par
- Alex Baker's wild position swings: up three, down three, up three again
- The par-4 17th plays as the day's executioner at 2.8 strokes over par
- Nine combined disasters across the brutal H17-H18 closing stretch

### Player Summaries

**Stuart NEUMANN:** Dominant 39-point performance with balanced 20-19 split sets early standard, leads both Trophy (by 5) and maintains strong Jacket position despite higher gross score. Reclaimed lead at H6 and never looked back.

**Jon BAKER:** Strong 34-point round built on patient middle section and powerful 12-point finish, surged to joint-second at H14. Leads Green Jacket on 21 gross, shares Trophy second place.

**Gregg WILLIAMS:** Most consistent player with perfectly balanced 17-17 split, briefly held lead at H4. Joint-second in Trophy, strong Jacket position on 18 gross.

**David MULLIN:** Rollercoaster 33 points featured brilliant 14-point opener and 12-point finish sandwiching disastrous 7-point middle section. Fourth place, six points back with significant ground to make up.

**Alex BAKER:** Difficult 29-point debut plagued by volatility through middle section despite three separate position jumps. Ten points off pace with three rounds to recover, faces steepest climb in field.
