# TEG 16 - Round 3 Report

## Neumann Surges Clear With Commanding Back Nine
**Penha Longa • 09/10/2023 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Stuart Neumann arrived at Penha Longa protecting a slender lead, but left with breathing room after a dominant 39-point performance extended his advantage to 12 points heading into the final round. The tournament leader found another gear on the back nine, posting 21 points to pull clear of a charging field.

The day's real fireworks came from Gregg Williams, whose explosive 22-point back nine propelled him from fourth to second place, leapfrogging both Jon Baker and David Mullin in the process. Williams' 37-point round—a seven-point improvement on his previous outing—slashed four points off Neumann's lead and has reignited the trophy race with one round remaining.

The drama centered on Penha Longa's brutal middle stretch, where the par-5 12th played as the course's hardest hole at two-over-par average. That single hole proved decisive in the day's position changes, with Mullin gaining two spots before fading on the inward nine dropped him to fourth. Baker held onto third despite volatile position swings, while Alex Baker's steady improvement couldn't lift him from fifth.

### How It Unfolded

**Morning Skirmishes**

Neumann stamped his authority early, posting 12 points through the opening six holes to maintain his overnight lead. The par-4 first and third—both playing nearly two shots over par—claimed victims across the field, but the leader navigated them cleanly. Mullin kept pace with a solid 11-point start, while Alex Baker stumbled with just nine points before finding his rhythm.

**The Decisive Middle Stretch**

The tournament's complexion shifted dramatically at the par-4 seventh, where six scoring events triggered a reshuffle that saw Jon Baker climb two positions. But it was the par-5 12th—Penha Longa's monster, averaging a shocking seven strokes—that proved the round's pivotal moment. Mullin gained two spots in the chaos, while Baker surrendered them just as quickly. Neumann extended his lead with 14 points across the middle six, the round's strongest segment at that stage.

**Back Nine Explosion**

Williams unleashed his charge on the inward nine, torching the final six holes for 15 points. His 22-point back nine didn't just move him into second—it announced him as Neumann's primary threat. The leader responded with 13 points of his own, refusing to buckle under pressure. The par-5 18th, the course's easiest hole at level par, provided birdie chances that Williams seized while others faltered. Baker posted 13 points in the closing stretch to cement third, but Mullin's 14-point back nine—two fewer than his front—saw him slip to fourth as Williams and the Bakers all improved their positions.

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:**

Neumann's 12-point cushion over Williams looks commanding but isn't insurmountable. Based on recent scoring, players are averaging 33-39 points per round at their best. Williams needs to win the final round by at least 12 points while hoping Neumann falters—possible but requiring both exceptional personal performance and mistakes from the leader. Neumann, meanwhile, needs just 27 points to guarantee the trophy even if Williams posts another 37-point masterclass.

The battle for third through fifth is razor-tight. Just six points separate Baker in third from his brother Alex in fifth, with Mullin sandwiched between at four points back. Any of these three could jump positions with a strong final round. Baker needs to protect third against Mullin (three points back) while keeping Williams honest should the second-place man stumble.

The Spoon race appears academic barring disaster, but Alex Baker's 19-point deficit to the leader means even a career round won't threaten the trophy. His focus must be climbing past Mullin and potentially his brother for a podium finish. Mullin's tournament has stalled—dropping from second to fourth after his four-point decline from Round 2—and he'll need to rediscover his Round 2 form (34 points) to defend fourth place.

### Round Highlights

- Williams' devastating 22-point back nine surge, cutting the gap from 16 to 12 points
- The par-5 12th playing as a genuine monster at two-over-par average, redistributing the leaderboard
- Neumann's composed response to Williams' charge with 13 closing points to maintain control
- The par-4 seventh sparking six scoring events and triggering the day's first major position change
- Both Baker brothers posting matching 33-point rounds via different routes—Jon consistent (17/16 split), Alex building momentum (9/12/12)

### Player Summaries

**Stuart Neumann:** Extended his lead with 39 points (26 gross) and the day's best performance, particularly strong through the middle six (14 points) before a 21-point back nine sealed his advantage. Now leads by 12 heading into the final round.

**Gregg Williams:** Rocketed from fourth to second with 37 points (15 gross), fueled by an explosive 22-point back nine that slashed four points off the leader's margin. His seven-point improvement from Round 2 makes him the form player entering the finale.

**Jon Baker:** Held third with a steady 33 points (25 gross) despite position volatility at the seventh and 12th holes. His consistent 17/16 split front-to-back keeps him in the podium hunt, one point behind Williams.

**David Mullin:** Slipped from second to fourth with 30 points (26 gross), a four-point decline from Round 2. His 14-point back nine couldn't match his 16-point front, and the gap to Neumann has grown from 13 to 16 points.

**Alex Baker:** Remained fifth but posted 33 points (34 gross) showing improving form through the round (9/12/12 split). Despite matching his brother's Stableford total, his 19-point deficit to the leader leaves him chasing podium positions rather than the trophy.
