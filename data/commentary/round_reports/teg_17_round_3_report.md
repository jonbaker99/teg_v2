## Round Report

# Baker Brothers Diverge as Jon Seals Command at Óbidos

**Royal Óbidos • 07/10/2024 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Royal Óbidos nursing a slender three-point lead and departed with an iron grip on the TEG Trophy. His masterful 44-point haul—matching his second-round brilliance—built an 11-point cushion that looks increasingly unassailable with just 18 holes remaining. The round belonged entirely to Baker from the seventh hole onwards, where he unleashed 33 points across the final 12 holes to leave his rivals trailing in his wake.

While Jon Baker surged, his namesake Alex Baker endured contrasting fortunes. After a sparkling 13-point start through six holes suggested he might close the gap, the wheels came off spectacularly over the closing stretch. Just seven points from the final six holes saw him tumble to 23 points adrift, effectively ending his title challenge. David Mullin held second place with steady golf, but his 35-point return couldn't keep pace with the leader's relentless assault. The only position change saw John Patterson's storming 41-point round lift him past Gregg Williams into fourth.

### How It Unfolded

The opening holes provided little indication of the carnage to come. Alex Baker looked dangerous with 13 points through six, whilst Jon Baker's modest 11-point start suggested he might be vulnerable. The easy par-3 third offered brief respite, but the field collectively held its breath approaching the par-5 fifth—a hole that would prove the day's executioner.

**The Fifth Circle**

Disaster struck at the fifth, where scoring averaged a ghastly 7.8 strokes against par. The field limped away averaging just 0.6 points per player from what should have been a birdie opportunity. It was a horror show that reset the round and separated the survivors from the casualties.

**Baker Takes Command**

Emerging from the wreckage, Jon Baker shifted through the gears. Between the seventh and twelfth holes, he hammered out 16 points—the best middle-six performance of the day. Alex Baker stayed in touch with 14 points across the same stretch, but Patterson (13 points) was quietly building something special, whilst Mullin's 11-point return suggested he was treading water rather than attacking.

**The Decisive Closing Stretch**

The final six holes delivered the knockout blow. Jon Baker was simply unstoppable, pouring in 17 points to seal a commanding round victory and extend his tournament lead beyond realistic reach. Patterson matched those 17 points hole-for-hole, his exceptional closing burst securing a position gain that salvaged his tournament. But for Alex Baker, it was agony. Seven points from the final six represented a complete collapse—the worst closing performance of the day saw him fade from contention to also-ran. Gregg Williams managed just five points over those crucial holes, ensuring he'd swap places with the surging Patterson and slip to fifth.

### Standings After Round 3

**Round 3 Stableford:** JB 44 | JP 41 | DM 35 | AB 34 | GW 26  
**Round 3 Gross:** JB +14 | DM +21 | AB +22 | JP +15 | GW +30

**Tournament Stableford:** JB 130 | DM 119 | AB 107 | JP 103 | GW 98  
**Tournament Gross:** DM +72 | JB +78 | AB +93 | JP +106 | GW +125

### What's At Stake

**With one round remaining:**

Jon Baker's 11-point advantage represents nearly 25% of a typical round score. To put it bluntly, David Mullin would need to win the final round by a massive margin whilst Baker implodes—and implosions simply haven't been part of Baker's vocabulary this week. Mullin requires approximately 12-15 more points than Baker just to draw level, meaning he needs a 45+ point round combined with Baker struggling to mid-30s. Possible? Barely. Probable? Not remotely.

The real tournament now concerns second place and the mathematical spoon battle. Alex Baker sits 12 points clear of fourth-placed Patterson, making third place relatively secure. Patterson's 41-point explosion has given him breathing room over Gregg Williams, who languishes 32 points behind the leader and five behind Patterson. Williams needs his best round of the tournament—and Patterson to falter—just to reclaim fourth.

The Green Jacket battle presents marginally more intrigue. Mullin's six-shot advantage over Baker in gross scoring means he needs only avoid complete disaster to claim that secondary prize. Baker would require an exceptional final round combined with Mullin adding 25+ shots to have any chance of the Jacket double.

### Round Highlights

- Jon Baker's 26-point back nine demolishes the field and effectively seals the TEG Trophy
- The par-5 fifth becomes a graveyard, averaging 7.8 strokes as the entire field suffers
- John Patterson's 24-point back nine represents the tournament's best closing nine and lifts him into fourth
- Alex Baker's seven-point collapse over the final six holes ends his title challenge
- The par-3 third provides the day's only relief, averaging just 0.4 over par

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** A complete performance built on relentless back-nine scoring (26 points across holes 7-18). Matched his second-round 44 points and transformed a tenuous lead into a commanding position. Barring catastrophe, the TEG Trophy is his to lose.

**David Mullin:** Consistency personified with balanced nine-hole splits (17/18), but his 35-point return couldn't match Baker's firepower. Maintains second place and looks secure for the Green Jacket, but the Trophy appears beyond reach.

**Alex Baker:** Started like a train with 13 points through six holes, finished like he'd run out of track. The seven-point final six holes represented a tournament-ending collapse that leaves him 23 points adrift and facing a battle just to hold third.

**John Patterson:** Transformed his tournament with a magnificent 41-point round, featuring 17 points over the final six holes that matched the leader stroke-for-stroke. Rises to fourth and brings renewed energy to the closing round.

**Gregg Williams:** A forgettable day yielding just 26 points sees him drop to fifth, 32 points behind Baker. The weak final six (5 points) suggests he's running out of steam at precisely the wrong moment.
