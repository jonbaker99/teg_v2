# TEG 3 - Round 3 Report

## Baker Extends Lead with Dominant Middle Six at Boavista
**Boavista • 07/10/2010 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

Jon Baker arrived at Boavista with a nine-point cushion and departed with a sixteen-point advantage after a masterclass in consistent pressure. His 45-point haul – seven points better than his previous round – featured an exceptional 18-point burst through the middle six holes that effectively snuffed out any lingering challenge. David Mullin kept pace with a solid 40 points to maintain second place, while behind them Gregg Williams produced the round's strongest finish to leapfrog Henry Meller into third.

The day's most dramatic subplot unfolded at the opposite end of the leaderboard, where Meller endured a catastrophic opening stretch that yielded just six points through the first six holes – the worst six-hole split anyone managed all day. Though he rallied impressively with fifteen points through the middle section, the damage proved terminal to his podium aspirations.

With one round remaining, Baker now holds what appears an unassailable lead, while the battle for the minor placings remains wide open. The Green Jacket competition tells a different story, with Mullin's superior ball-striking keeping him firmly in contention on the gross leaderboard.

### How It Unfolded

The tournament effectively ended as a contest somewhere around the ninth or tenth hole, though nobody could have predicted it from the opening exchanges. Through the first six holes, four players – Mullin, Williams, and Stuart Neumann alongside Baker – all carded identical twelve-point tallies. Only Meller, hemorrhaging shots and confidence in equal measure, found himself adrift.

Then Baker shifted through the gears. His middle-six performance was nothing short of exceptional: eighteen stableford points that represented the best six-hole stretch anyone managed all day. While Mullin responded with a creditable fifteen points to stay within touching distance, the gap had grown from nine to fourteen points by the time they reached the thirteenth tee. Behind them, Meller was staging a recovery mission, matching Mullin's fifteen-point haul through the same stretch, but the arithmetic told a brutal story – he'd fallen from third to fourth and was now twenty-four points off the pace.

The closing stretch belonged to Williams, whose fifteen-point finish – coupled with Baker's steady fourteen – secured the position swap with Meller. The par-3 14th, the day's easiest hole at an average of even par and 3.4 stableford points, offered brief respite in a round where the par-3 2nd proved the field's nemesis at an average of 2.4 strokes over par. Baker's 21 gross strokes for the round reinforced his dominance across both competitions, while Mullin's 14 gross continued his superior form on the Green Jacket leaderboard.

### What's At Stake

**With 1 round remaining:**

Baker's sixteen-point advantage over Mullin borders on the insurmountable. Even if Mullin produces a career-best performance and Baker suffers a complete collapse, the mathematics heavily favor the leader. Baker needs only average thirty-one points in the final round to guarantee the TEG Trophy – a modest target given his three-round average of 42.7 points. For Mullin to catch him requires not just a personal best but also Baker's worst round by some distance, making second place the realistic ceiling.

The real drama lies in the battle for third through fifth. Williams holds a slender three-point advantage over Meller and six over Neumann – both entirely catchable margins. Meller needs to bounce back from his opening-hole disaster and find form closer to his second-round 38 points, while Neumann requires approximately forty points and favorable results elsewhere to climb onto the podium. Williams, having shown the best finish on the day, carries momentum but will need to maintain that closing form across all eighteen holes.

On the Green Jacket front, Mullin's twenty-two stroke advantage over Baker suggests a different champion awaits in the gross competition, though one round can produce dramatic swings.

### Round Highlights

- Henry Meller's catastrophic opening six holes (6 pts) – the worst six-hole split of the entire round
- Jon Baker's dominant middle-six stretch (18 pts) that effectively sealed the tournament
- Gregg Williams' strong fifteen-point finish to overtake Meller for third place
- The par-3 2nd proving the day's toughest test at 2.4 strokes over par on average
- David Mullin's consistent 20-point splits on both nines maintaining second place

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Dominated the middle six with eighteen points to extend his lead to sixteen, combining steady bookends (13 pts opening, 14 pts closing) with exceptional mid-round play. His 45-point haul and +21 gross leave him in commanding positions in both competitions.

**David Mullin:** Solid 40-point round with perfectly balanced nines (20/20) keeps him in second place, though sixteen points adrift with one to play. His +14 gross extends his Green Jacket advantage to twenty-two strokes.

**Gregg Williams:** Climbed from fourth to third with a 41-point performance featuring a strong back nine (22 pts). His fifteen-point closing stretch was the best finish of the day, though he trails the leader by twenty-one points.

**Henry Meller:** Disastrous opening (6 pts through first six) derailed his round despite creditable recovery efforts (15 pts middle six). His 33-point total dropped him to fourth, twenty-four points behind Baker with one round remaining.

**Stuart Neumann:** Consistent bookends (12 pts opening, 14 pts closing) couldn't compensate for a poor middle six (10 pts). Remains fifth, twenty-seven points off the lead but still mathematically within range of the podium places.
