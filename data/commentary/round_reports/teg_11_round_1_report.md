## Round Report

# Baker Seizes Early Command in Catalunya Opener
**PGA Catalunya - Stadium • 04/10/2018 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The 11th TEG Trophy burst into life at PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course with four lead changes in the opening six holes before Jon Baker seized control and never looked back. Baker's commanding 35-point performance—built on a blistering 19-point front nine—gives him a three-point cushion over brother Alex heading into Round 2, with three rounds still to play in this wide-open championship.

The opening salvo suggested a tight battle ahead, as David Mullin matched Baker's early pace before the decisive seventh hole shifted the tournament's momentum. While Baker coasted through the closing stretch, it was Gregg Williams who served notice with a stunning 13-point finish over the final six holes—the field's best closing surge—to vault into third place and position himself just five points off the pace.

### How It Unfolded

The tournament exploded from the blocks with John Patterson grabbing the early advantage, only to surrender the lead at the par-5 third where Mullin pounced to take top spot. But this was merely the opening act. Baker responded immediately at the fourth to seize the lead, though Mullin wasn't finished—he reclaimed pole position at the sixth with 13 points banked through the opening third.

The turning point arrived at the seventh hole. Baker retook the lead and this time there would be no looking back. His 13-point haul through the middle six holes—matching his opening surge—extended his advantage while Mullin cooled dramatically, managing just seven points through the same stretch. Patterson, who'd started brightly with 12 points in the first six, faded badly with only eight through the middle third as his challenge evaporated.

The entire field discovered Catalunya's teeth at the par-4 second hole, where the average score ballooned to 2.2 over par, yielding a meagre 1.2 Stableford points. That horror show would be matched only by the 13th, another par-4 disaster that proved equally unforgiving.

Through the closing stretch, Baker wisely protected his lead with a steady nine-point finish, while brother Alex—who'd struggled early with just 10 points in the first six—found his rhythm to secure second place with a solid 10-point closer. But the real fireworks came from Williams, whose explosive 13-point surge over the final six holes announced his presence as a serious threat. His 17-point back nine erased a sluggish start and catapulted him into third, while Mullin stabilized with nine points to limit the damage but couldn't mount a serious challenge.

### Standings After Round 1

**Tournament Stableford:** JB 35 | AB 32 | GW 30 | DM 29 | JP 26

**Tournament Gross:** JB +18 | AB +22 | GW +24 | DM +25 | JP +28

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Jon Baker's three-point cushion is commanding but far from decisive with 105 points still available over the final three rounds. History suggests the winner needs to average around 33-35 points per round—Baker's already hit that mark, but consistency will be key. Alex Baker needs to find an extra point per round to close the gap, while Williams—despite his late surge—faces a 1.7-point deficit per round, requiring sustained excellence rather than one explosive performance.

The mathematics remain brutal for those further back. Mullin needs two points per round more than Baker just to draw level, demanding near-perfect golf while hoping the leader stumbles. Patterson's nine-point deficit represents a three-point-per-round chase, which history suggests is borderline insurmountable unless a complete collapse materializes.

The Green Jacket race mirrors the Stableford standings, with Baker's four-stroke advantage over brother Alex representing solid but not insurmountable territory. The real question heading into Round 2: Can anyone maintain the kind of form Williams showed over his final six holes, or will Baker's consistency prove unbeatable?

### Round Highlights

- Four lead changes in the opening six holes set a frantic early pace
- Jon Baker's 19-point front nine establishes tournament control at the seventh hole
- The par-4 second and 13th holes emerge as Catalunya's twin monsters (2.2 over par average)
- Gregg Williams explodes for 13 points over the final six holes—best closing stretch of the field
- Alex Baker recovers from sluggish 10-point start to post 22 points on back nine

### Player Summaries

**Jon Baker:** Dominated with 35-point opening statement, including blistering 19-point front nine, and hasn't trailed since the seventh hole. Holds three-point lead with steady back-nine management.

**Alex Baker:** Overcame slow start (10 points first six) with impressive 22-point rally on back nine to sit three points back. Strong middle stretch (12 points) suggests he's finding form at the right time.

**Gregg Williams:** Reversed fortunes dramatically with 17-point back nine after sluggish start. Explosive 13-point finish over final six holes serves warning he's a live threat despite five-point deficit.

**David Mullin:** Hot opening (13 points first six) suggested title challenge before middle-stretch fade (7 points). Stabilized late but sits six points adrift needing sustained brilliance.

**John Patterson:** Early promise (12 points first six) dissolved into disappointing fade with just 14 points over final twelve holes. Nine-point gap looks mountainous with three rounds remaining.
