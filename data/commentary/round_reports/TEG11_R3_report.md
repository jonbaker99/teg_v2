# TEG 11 - Round 3 Report

## Baker Seizes Lead as Patterson Claims Best Round at El Prat
**El Prat - Azul • 06/10/2018 • Round 3 of 4**

### Round Summary

The TEG Trophy lead changed hands twice at El Prat's Azul course as Alex Baker wrestled control from overnight leader Jon Baker in a dramatic third round. While John Patterson fired the day's best score of 39 Stableford points to claim round honors, the real story unfolded in the battle for tournament supremacy. Alex Baker's composed 36-point round, built on a strong back-nine surge of 19 points, lifted him from second to first with a two-point cushion heading into the final round.

Jon Baker, who had dominated Round 2 with 41 points, endured a frustrating fade after a brilliant start. Leading through twelve holes, he managed just nine points over the closing stretch as the pressure mounted. The turning point came at the par-4 13th, where six scoring events in a single hole reshaped the entire leaderboard and saw Alex reclaim top spot at 100 cumulative points. With one round remaining, the Trophy race remains wide open.

In the secondary Green Jacket gross competition, the battle continues with positions largely holding steady through the round's fluctuations.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker seized the initiative early at the par-3 2nd, posting strong Stableford returns to nudge ahead of Alex Baker at 79 cumulative points. Through the opening six holes, the elder Baker kept his composure despite trailing by a point, grinding out nine points while his namesake collected ten. David Mullin and Gregg Williams both carded solid tens to stay within striking distance, but it was John Patterson's opening salvo of 13 points that hinted at the fireworks to come.

The middle stretch of holes belonged entirely to Patterson. From the 7th through the 12th, he piled up an astonishing 16 points—nearly half his day's work compressed into six holes. The par-4 7th and par-5 9th proved the easiest on the course, averaging 2.6 Stableford points each, and Patterson feasted on both. Alex Baker found his rhythm during this stretch too, adding 14 crucial points to stay within touching distance. Jon Baker extended his lead with a steady 13-point return, but the warning signs were emerging. The field universally struggled at the treacherous par-4 11th, which played more than two shots over par on average and yielded a miserly 1.2 Stableford points per player—a true disaster hole that disrupted everyone's momentum.

Everything changed at the 13th. The par-4 became the round's flashpoint, with six separate scoring events occurring in quick succession. Alex Baker surged ahead to 100 cumulative points, finally overtaking Jon Baker who had led since the second hole. From there, the final stretch became a test of nerve. Gregg Williams produced the day's most spectacular finish, roaring home with 15 points over the last six holes to keep himself firmly in Trophy contention. Alex Baker matched the pressure with 13 closing points, enough to establish breathing room at the top. Jon Baker, meanwhile, suffered through the round's most painful collapse—managing just nine points over the final six holes as his overnight lead evaporated. Patterson steadied with ten points down the stretch to secure his round victory, while David Mullin's back-nine stumble of just 11 points saw him slip from fourth to fifth.

### What's At Stake

With one round remaining, the TEG Trophy remains tantalizingly open. Alex Baker's two-point advantage over Jon Baker is the slimmest of margins—little more than a single hole's difference in Stableford scoring. The leader needs consistency above all: average even 34 points in the final round and force Jon to produce something extraordinary. For the challenger, it's simple arithmetic—match or exceed 36 points and hope Alex falters under the pressure of protecting a lead.

Gregg Williams, six points back in third, faces steeper odds but remains mathematically alive. He'd need to post something near his Round 2 form of 39 points while hoping for stumbles ahead, but his spectacular 15-point closing surge proves he has the firepower. John Patterson, eleven behind after his round-winning 39, has the momentum but needs perfection plus help—realistically, he's playing for fourth. David Mullin, sixteen adrift after his back-nine collapse, is now focused on securing fifth place rather than challenging for silverware.

The Green Jacket gross competition sees David Mullin holding a seven-shot advantage over Jon Baker, though the volatility of this field suggests nothing is secure. Alex Baker and Gregg Williams remain within range if Mullin's struggles continue, making the secondary competition equally compelling heading into the final eighteen.
