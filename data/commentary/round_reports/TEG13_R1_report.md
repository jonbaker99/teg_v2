# TEG 13 - Round 1 Report

## Baker Blitzes Opening Six to Seize Control at Royal Cinque Ports
**Royal Cinque Ports • 08/10/2020 • Round 1 of 4**

### Round Summary

The 13th TEG Trophy got underway at Royal Cinque Ports with Jon Baker delivering a masterclass in fast starts, carding 39 Stableford points to establish a commanding six-point lead. Baker's explosive opening six holes—worth 17 points alone—set the tone for a round that saw him claim the lead at the par-4 2nd and never relinquish it.

While Baker dominated the headlines, the real drama unfolded behind him. Gregg Williams overcame a sluggish start to post the day's best closing stretch, surging from 7 points through six holes to finish with 33. The battle for third saw David Mullin and Alex Baker deadlocked on 31 points after contrasting routes—Mullin's consistency against Alex Baker's strong finish. John Patterson's solid start faded on the back nine, leaving him 11 adrift in fifth.

With three rounds still to play at this unforgiving links, Baker holds the TEG Trophy lead while Gregg Williams also tops the Green Jacket standings at 13-over-par gross.

### How It Unfolded

Jon Baker wasted no time stamping his authority on TEG 13. By the time the field reached the 6th green, he'd already banked 17 Stableford points—nearly half his eventual round total—and established a lead he wouldn't surrender. The par-4 2nd hole proved pivotal, with Baker seizing the tournament lead from Gregg Williams and immediately putting daylight between himself and the chasing pack.

Williams, in contrast, labored through those opening holes with just 7 points, while John Patterson kept himself in contention with a solid 11-point start. David Mullin and Alex Baker found themselves in the middle ground, posting moderate returns of 10 and 9 points respectively.

The middle stretch tested everyone's resolve. The par-4 10th emerged as the day's monster, the field averaging a brutal 2.4 strokes over par and yielding just 0.8 Stableford points on average. Baker navigated the treacherous middle six with 11 points to maintain his cushion, while Williams matched that output to begin his fightback. Patterson, however, managed only 7 points through this crucial stretch, effectively ending his challenge before the back nine proper had begun.

The closing stretch delivered high drama. Williams found his rhythm with a tournament-best 15 points over the final six holes, charging through the field to claim second place. His surge at the par-4 15th proved decisive, climbing three positions while Patterson tumbled the same distance. Alex Baker matched Williams's 15-point finish to vault into a tie for third, while David Mullin's 13-point close kept him level with his namesake. The par-4 17th offered brief respite—the easiest hole on the card at just 0.2 over par—before the field completed their opening salvos. Baker, content to manage rather than extend, posted 11 points on the run-in to protect his advantage.

### What's At Stake

**With 3 rounds remaining:**

Jon Baker's six-point cushion is substantial but far from insurmountable. At current pace (39 points per round), he'd finish with 156 points, but Royal Cinque Ports rarely allows such consistency. More realistically, Baker needs to average 30-32 points over the remaining three rounds to keep clear water between himself and the chasers—a tall order given the course's exposed nature and the pressure of protecting a lead.

Gregg Williams sits in the ideal stalking position. His 33-point opening, boosted by that electric 15-point close, suggests he's found something to build on. He needs to average 34 points per round to catch Baker at current pace, or more likely, post one monster round while banking 30+ in the others. The gap is just two quality holes per round—entirely catchable.

The tied-third duo of David Mullin and Alex Baker (both on 31) need 35-36 points per round to reach Baker's current trajectory, requiring either a significant step up or hoping Baker falters. At eight points back, they need one explosive round soon to apply real pressure. John Patterson, 11 adrift, faces the steepest climb but remains mathematically alive. Over 72 holes at this level, stranger comebacks have materialized—but he needs to find five extra points per round just to match Baker's opening salvo.

In the Green Jacket race, Williams's 13-over gross gives him early bragging rights, though the gaps are tighter here. With three rounds to navigate, the real battle may only be beginning.
