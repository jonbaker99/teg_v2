## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy with a three-point victory over Gregg Williams after a wild final-round shootout at Palmares. Baker led after the opening round at Boavista, lost the advantage through two chaotic middle rounds, then reclaimed control on the first hole of the finale. He never trailed again. Williams entered the final round one point ahead but unravelled spectacularly, his challenge ending with a quintuple bogey at the 16th that sealed his fate.

David Mullin completed an extraordinary paradox. He dominated the Green Jacket competition from start to finish, leading all 72 holes and winning by 54 strokes. Yet his 136 Stableford points earned him the Wooden Spoon, three points behind fourth place. No player has ever paired the Jacket with the Spoon.

## Round 1: Boavista baptism {.round1 .round}

Baker opened with a one-point lead over Mullin as the tournament returned to the Algarve after a two-TEG absence. The parkland course at Boavista offered stunning Atlantic views, but the beauty masked brutality.

The round became a war of attrition. Williams suffered a quintuple bogey at the 17th, wiping out earlier gains. Baker's own quintuple at the sixth cost him the Trophy lead, which he reclaimed at the 16th with a rare birdie. Mullin birdied twice early but finished level par through five holes, building a commanding eight-stroke Gross lead. He trailed Baker by a single Stableford point. Neumann collapsed late with back-to-back zeros at 16 and 18, completing a miserable opening 30 points.

Baker's 40 points held him narrowly ahead. Mullin sat second in both competitions. The margins were tight. The chaos had only just begun.

## Round 2: Neumann explodes, lead swaps eight times {.round2 .round}

Mullin seized the Trophy lead with a solid 40 points as eight lead changes carved up the second round back at Boavista. Baker lost the advantage at the second hole with a triple bogey. He never recovered.

Neumann produced the performance of the tournament. His career-best 45 points vaulted him from last to fourth overall, fuelled by an 11-point birdie stretch between the eighth and 10th holes. Birdies bookended that purple patch. Williams posted 42 points to climb to second in the Trophy race, three points off the pace. Baker's 36-point fade dropped him to third, four points behind Mullin.

Mullin maintained his Gross dominance despite a zero at the 13th that briefly cost him the Trophy lead. He reclaimed it two holes later. Henry Meller endured a nightmare back nine, scoring just 11 points. A quintuple at the 16th and zeros at 14 and 18 buried him. Neumann's surge was the day's only bright spot.

Mullin led both competitions. The Gross margin stretched to 23 strokes. His Stableford advantage was one point. The tournament was still anyone's.

## Round 3: Williams edges ahead as drama strikes late {.round3 .round}

Williams grabbed the Trophy lead by a single point after a tumultuous third round at Boavista produced multiple late lead changes. Mullin suffered a personal-worst 27 Stableford points but maintained an iron grip on the Green Jacket.

The drama centred on three holes. Williams took the lead at the third with four points, only to lose it at the 17th with a zero. Baker seized control at the same hole with two points. Williams snatched it back on the 18th as Baker posted his second quintuple of the week, a nine that handed the advantage straight back.

Zeros littered the leaderboard. Mullin recorded three in his worst-ever Stableford round, including disasters at the 13th and 17th. Neumann imploded with back-to-back zeros at 17 and 18. Meller's triple bogey at the last capped another difficult day. The Spoon race tightened as Neumann and Meller separated themselves from the pack.

Williams entered the final round holding a one-point lead over Baker. Mullin trailed by three in the Trophy but held a 23-stroke Gross cushion. The stage was set for a final-round duel.

## Round 4: Baker surges, Williams collapses at Palmares {.round4 .round}

Baker reclaimed the Trophy lead on the first hole at Palmares and held it through five subsequent lead swaps with Williams. The decisive blow arrived on the back nine as Baker birdied three times in four holes. Williams answered with a quintuple at the 16th that ended his challenge.

The finale switched venues to the links-style Praia loop at Palmares. Baker opened with a par for three points, edging ahead. A birdie at the third extended his margin. Williams briefly regained the lead at the fifth after Baker suffered his second quintuple of the week, an eight. The pendulum swung again at the sixth. Baker took control for good at the 13th with two points despite a double bogey.

The closing stretch sealed it. Baker birdied the 14th and 15th, building an unassailable cushion. Williams three-putted for a triple at the 13th, then collapsed at the 16th. His quintuple bogey nine closed the door. Baker cruised home with 42 points and a back-nine 22 to secure the Trophy by three points.

Mullin posted just 30 points but his 54-stroke Gross margin made it academic. Meller's career-best 39 points lifted him to fourth overall, tied with Neumann on 139 points. Williams finished second with 153 points. Baker's 156-point total and five lead swaps told the story of resilience under pressure.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Baker's victory hinged on composure when it mattered most. He led the opening round, absorbed two rounds of chaos, then seized control on the final day's first hole. Five lead swaps with Williams followed, but Baker never trailed after the 13th. His back-nine birdie blitz, three in four holes, was the tournament's defining sequence. Williams entered the finale as leader but could not sustain it. His front nine held promise with 22 points. The back nine brought disaster. The quintuple at 16 was the final blow in a 16-point collapse.

Mullin's dual achievement defies logic. His wire-to-wire Gross dominance never wavered, leading all 72 holes with a 54-stroke cushion. Yet his Stableford total of 136 points trailed every player, finishing three behind fourth. The Jacket and Spoon combination is unprecedented. Neumann's second-round 45 points remains the tournament highlight, an 11-point birdie burst that lifted him from last to fourth by the close. Meller's final-round 39 secured a tie for third overall despite earlier struggles.

Baker held the lead for 36 of 72 holes. Williams led for 30. Mullin's 31 holes in front earned him nothing in Stableford terms. The margins were razor-thin in the Trophy race. The Gross competition was never in doubt. Baker's resilience and Williams' late collapse decided the silverware.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (1st Trophy, 2nd Gross):** His second Trophy arrived through grit and timing. Led after round one, regained control in the finale, and never trailed again after the 13th. Five birdies across four rounds, including a decisive treble between the 13th and 15th on the final day. Two quintuples tested his resolve but he answered each time.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd Trophy, T5th Gross):** Held the lead entering the final round but could not close. Front-nine 22 points promised victory. Back-nine 16 ended it. The quintuple at 16 was the killer blow. Finished three points behind Baker despite leading for 30 holes overall. Zero birdies all week told its own story.

**Henry MELLER (T3rd Trophy, 4th Gross):** Career-best 39 points in the finale lifted him into a podium tie. Strong front nines throughout, including a 21-point effort in round three. Just one birdie all tournament but consistent Stableford scoring earned his place.

**Stuart NEUMANN (T3rd Trophy, 3rd Gross):** The second-round 45 remains the tournament's standout moment. His 11-point birdie stretch between the eighth and 10th vaulted him from last to fourth. Could not maintain that form, posting 32 points in each of the final two rounds.

**David MULLIN (5th Trophy, 1st Gross, Wooden Spoon):** Unprecedented. Led the Gross for all 72 holes with a 54-stroke cushion, claiming his fourth Jacket. Six birdies included back-to-back efforts at 12 and 13 in the finale. Yet his 136 Stableford points finished three behind fourth place, earning the Spoon. Personal-worst 27 points in round three epitomised the disconnect.
