# TEG 4: Mullin's Double Sweep Amid Baker's Collapse

**East Sussex, England, 2011** – David Mullin claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket in commanding fashion, sweeping both competitions at TEG's inaugural East Sussex visit across Ashdown, Lingfield, Crowborough, and Bletchingley. The defending champion seized control mid-tournament and held firm, winning the Trophy by 3 points over Jon Baker (137-134) and the Jacket by 19 strokes (+81 to Stuart Neumann's +100).

Baker's collapse defined the drama. Leading or co-leading for 49 holes, the TEG 1 champion imploded on the final back nine with catastrophic blow-ups at H15 (11-shot meltdown) and H12 (9/+6). Henry Meller's Round 2 surge—posting the tournament's best round (36 points)—created a three-way battle that saw 10 lead changes before Mullin pulled clear. Gregg Williams earned his first Wooden Spoon with 110 points and 14 blow-ups across four rounds.

Baker's Round 4 eagle at H8—a 2-shot stunner on the par-4—marked the tournament's only eagle and came moments before his historic collapse. Meller's Round 1 catastrophe at H11 (12/+9) stood as the week's worst single hole, yet he recovered to challenge for the lead by Round 2's close.
