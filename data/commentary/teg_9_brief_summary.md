# TEG 9: Patterson's Debut Dominance on Lisbon Coast

**Óbidos, Portugal, 2016** — John Patterson claimed his first Trophy in his TEG debut, seizing control with a historic 49-point Round 2 explosion and never looking back. Patterson won by 6 points over Alex Baker's late surge. David Mullin captured his seventh Green Jacket, leading wire-to-wire in gross to win by 21 strokes.

Patterson's Round 2 masterclass at Praia D'El Rey—featuring three birdies and 20 points across the final twelve holes—built an unshakeable foundation. Alex Baker mounted a spirited chase with back-to-back 44-point rounds after a disastrous 32-point opener. Jon Baker led after Round 1 but faded to fourth, while Mullin's relentless gross consistency never wavered across 72 holes at Royal Óbidos and Praia D'El Rey.

Brutal conditions produced 38 blow-ups against just 10 birdies tournament-wide. Stuart Neumann earned his third Wooden Spoon with 127 points, enduring 14 total meltdowns including quintuple-bogeys at H4 and H11 in Round 1.
