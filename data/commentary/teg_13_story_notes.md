# TEG 13 Story Notes

## Key Points
- Jon BAKER's 3rd Trophy & 3rd Green Jacket - swept both competitions with wire-to-wire dominance, leading all 72 holes
- 6-point Trophy margin over Williams; 18-stroke Jacket margin - controlled from gun to tape
- Patterson's wild ride: 49pts (best round of tournament, R3) sandwiched between disasters, including 28pt collapse (R1-R2) and eagle-to-triple sequence (R4)
- Williams challenged early, briefly seizing Trophy lead twice but never sustained - finished runner-up in both competitions
- Mullin's Wooden Spoon sealed by catastrophic 9 (+5) on R4 H10 - his 4th career Spoon despite 9 Green Jackets
- Most consistent winner in TEG history: J. BAKER posted lowest gross score (+50) ever recorded

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** JB 39pts leads Trophy by 6; JB +13 leads Jacket by 9
- **Round 2:** GW briefly seized Trophy lead at H15, lost it H16; JB reclaimed with H18 birdie to lead by 1pt
- **Round 3:** JB extended Trophy lead to 5pts with 44pts; JP's 49pts moved him 5th to 3rd
- **Round 4:** JB secured sweep with 39pts, maintaining 6pt Trophy/18-stroke Jacket margins

## Story Angles
- Baker's perfect lead control - first wire-to-wire sweep since venue introduction, never trailed a single hole
- Patterson's tournament of extremes: 49pt masterclass vs 28pt meltdown, eagle vs quintuple bogey, climbed from 5th to tie 3rd despite R1-R2 collapse
- Williams' near-miss heartbreak - challenged throughout, took Trophy lead twice (R1 H1, R2 H15), finished 2nd in both competitions yet couldn't sustain
- Mullin's Spoon paradox: 9-time Jacket winner collects 4th Spoon after H10 catastrophe, averaging close to +3 per round
- Baker brothers' contrast: Jon's dominance vs Alex's roller-coaster (best round 44pts, worst 31pts)
- Historic margin: J. BAKER's +50 gross breaks tournament record by 18 strokes over Williams
