# TEG 13 Story Notes

## Key Points
- Jon BAKER's 3rd Trophy & 3rd Green Jacket - swept both competitions with wire-to-wire dominance, never relinquishing either lead across all 72 holes
- Led every single hole of the tournament in both Stableford and Gross competitions - no lead changes whatsoever
- Won by 6 points (Trophy) and 18 strokes (Jacket) margins - comfortable victories in both competitions
- John PATTERSON's wild rollercoaster: eagle on H2 R4, immediately followed by blow-up on H3; finished joint 3rd Trophy despite most erratic play (21-point round swing)
- David MULLIN's disastrous Wooden Spoon collapse - from 8-time Jacket winner to hitting H10 R4 disaster (9 / +5)

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** JB 39pts leads Trophy by 6; JB/GW tied E early, JB surges to +13 Gross lead by 9
- **Round 2:** JB maintains both leads despite GW briefly taking Trophy lead at H15; GW's 41pts best round but still trails by 1pt
- **Round 3:** JB extends Trophy lead to 5pts with 44pts; JP's 49pts round rockets from 5th to joint 3rd Trophy
- **Round 4:** JB closes with 39pts to seal 6-point Trophy win; AB's 44pts (best R4) not enough to challenge

## Story Angles
- Total dominance narrative - J. BAKER led all 72 holes in both competitions, zero lead changes, wire-to-wire sweep
- PATTERSON's bipolar brilliance - eagle/blow-up combo in 2 holes (R4), 49pt round (R3) vs 28pt round (R2), finished joint 3rd despite chaos
- David MULLIN's stunning fall from grace - 8-time Jacket winner claims Wooden Spoon, H10 R4 disaster (9 / +5) sealed fate
- WILLIAMS' relentless pursuit falls short - briefly took Trophy lead at R2 H15, finished 2nd in both competitions, never led after R1
- Alex BAKER vs Jon BAKER clarity maintained throughout (A. BAKER/J. BAKER or Alex/Jon) - both competitive across 72 holes
- Consistency vs volatility contrast - J. BAKER's steady dominance (8-point round range) vs PATTERSON's 21-point swings

## Quote-Worthy Lines
- "Led every single hole"
- "Eagle-to-disaster in two swings"
- "Eight Jackets to Wooden Spoon"
- "Never trailed, never faltered"
- "Fifty-six stroke gross spread"
- "Complete and utter control"
