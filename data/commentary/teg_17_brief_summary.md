# TEG 17: Baker's Dominant Double

**Lisbon Coast, Portugal, 2024** – Jon Baker claimed his fourth Trophy and fourth Green Jacket in commanding wire-to-wire fashion. After seizing both leads in Round 2, he never looked back—finishing 18 points clear in the Stableford and 13 strokes ahead in the gross. Baker led 67 of 72 holes in the Trophy race and 70 of 72 in the Jacket, cementing the most dominant performance of his career.

David Mullin's tournament of contrasts told the story of what might have been. His Round 2 masterclass—47 points, the best round in tournament history—featured back-to-back birdies and sublime shotmaking. But it couldn't erase opening with zero points on holes 1 and 2 of Round 1. He finished second in both competitions, 18 points and 13 strokes behind Baker.

John Patterson's week swung wildly between extremes. His opening 39 points had him leading after Round 1, but Round 2 brought catastrophe—a historic 22-point implosion including blow-ups at holes 13 (+5) and 15 (+6), the worst single round ever recorded. He rallied to tie for third in the Trophy with Alex Baker (135 points each), while Gregg Williams claimed his second Wooden Spoon after tumbling from joint gross leader in Round 1 to last place by tournament's end.
