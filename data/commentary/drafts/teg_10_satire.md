# TEG 10: Alex Baker's Breakthrough and John Patterson's Twelve Strokes at One Hole {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 10 | Algarve | 2017</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Alex Baker secured his maiden Trophy at the tenth TEG, overcoming an eight-point first-round deficit through the simple expedient of being slightly less terrible than everyone else. His victory margin of eleven points suggests dominance until you consider that 184 Stableford points across 72 holes represents the golfing equivalent of successfully completing a difficult crossword by only getting 40% wrong. David Mullin claimed his eighth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire authority, leading all 72 holes in gross competition whilst finishing third in Stableford, a statistical phenomenon that perfectly captures amateur golf's beautiful absurdism.

The tournament's emotional arc peaked on Round 4 when John Patterson authored a sextuple bogey on Boavista's eighth hole, the sixth catastrophic blow-up in his final eighteen holes. This represented not so much a collapse as a scorecards-led descent into numerical nihilism. Gregg Williams co-led entering the final round before recording what medical professionals would term "a complete psychological unraveling" on holes one, six, and eighteen. The Algarve sunshine served as witness to this theatre of voluntary suffering, returned to after a five-TEG absence that nobody had particularly mourned.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Alex Baker (1st Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Conquered his previous runner-up curse through the time-honoured method of shooting between 41 and 51 points in every round, which in amateur golf constitutes iron consistency. Suffered a quintuple bogey on Round 3's thirteenth that briefly threatened his ambitions before remembering that everyone else was equally hopeless. His breakthrough feels less like scaling Everest and more like winning a particularly fraught game of Jenga.

**Gregg Williams (2nd Trophy):** Posted the tournament's best round (48 points) whilst ultimately finishing eleven behind, which suggests either terrible timing or chronic inconsistency. Led entering the final day before blow-ups on holes one, six, and eighteen transformed co-leadership into runner-up with the efficiency of a controlled demolition. Continues to occupy the space between genuine competence and self-sabotage.

**David Mullin (3rd Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Won the Green Jacket by twelve strokes whilst never holding the Trophy lead after Round 2, a statistical quirk that reveals the TEG's dual-competition structure as either beautifully democratic or fundamentally absurd. His opening 49 points suggested brilliance; subsequent rounds averaging 38 points suggested mortality. Three birdies per round indicate someone playing actual golf rather than merely surviving it.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Finished runner-up in the Jacket by twelve strokes, which sounds respectable until you note the quintuple bogeys littering his card like forensic evidence. His tournament followed the classic pattern of occasional competence punctuated by holes that would make the RSPCA investigate if balls had feelings. Seventeen points behind the Trophy winner suggests proximity; the reality was existential distance.

**Stuart Neumann (5th):** Recorded eleven zero-point holes across four rounds, which represents statistical consistency in the wrong direction entirely. His final round 39 points came too late to matter, like remembering an excellent comeback three days after the argument. Zero birdies across 72 holes suggests a relationship with par based entirely on unfulfilled aspiration.

**John Patterson (6th, Wooden Spoon):** Authored the tournament's narrative masterpiece: a sextuple bogey on the final round's eighth hole, his second quintuple-or-worse of the back nine after the twelfth hole's similar disaster. Twenty zero-point holes across the tournament represents not so much bad golf as active warfare against the scorecard. Seventy-two points behind the winner feels less like a margin and more like a different sport entirely.

## Round 1: The Boavista Baptism {.round1 .round}

The return to Boavista after a five-TEG absence felt less like homecoming and more like revisiting the scene of historical trauma. The Portuguese sunshine illuminated not optimism but the full horrors of what was about to unfold. David Mullin's opening statement—49 points including three birdies—suggested someone playing an entirely different game to the rest of the field.

Alex Baker's round began with a quadruple bogey on the second, the sort of hole that prompts searching questions about life choices. He recovered with admirable stubbornness to post 41 points, eight behind Mullin, which in context felt less like disaster and more like damage limitation. Stuart Neumann scattered five zero-point holes across his opening eighteen like someone playing scorecard bingo, whilst Jon Baker led briefly on the ninth before reality reasserted itself with extreme prejudice.

The carnage concentrated on the par threes, which operated as mandatory tributes to golf's essential cruelty. The eighteenth witnessed a three-way blow-up featuring Williams, Neumann, and Patterson that suggested collective breakdown rather than individual failure. Mullin's birdie run from the thirteenth through sixteenth—three in four holes—represented genuinely impressive golf, which made everyone else's efforts look like performance art exploring futility.

By round's end, Mullin held an eight-point cushion that felt less like comfort and more like a small ledge halfway up a collapsing cliff face. His gross score of four over par whispered quality; everyone else's numbers screamed desperation. The lead had changed hands multiple times across the opening holes before Mullin seized control, which is the TEG way: chaos before hierarchy.

## Round 2: The Palmares Praia Inquisition {.round2 .round}

The new course at Palmares brought fresh tortures disguised as scenic variety. The links/parkland hybrid offered multiple ways to fail, and the field embraced every opportunity with enthusiasm bordering on self-harm. Gregg Williams authored a monster 48-point round that catapulted him into second place, proof that occasionally someone remembers how golf theoretically works.

John Patterson opened with a ten on the first hole—six over par—which functioned less as bad start and more as philosophical statement about his tournament's direction. His subsequent triple bogey on the tenth and blow-up on the eleventh suggested someone actively researching the limits of Stableford's scoring system. Alex Baker's birdie on the ninth represented a brief moment of actual golf before the sixteenth's blow-up reminded him of his place in the natural order.

David Mullin's 42 points maintained his five-point Trophy lead whilst extending his Jacket dominance, the sort of dual-competition management that suggests intelligence as much as skill. Stuart Neumann's consecutive zero-pointers on thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen represented not so much cold spell as meteorological apocalypse. The first hole alone witnessed a ten, two sevens, and assorted sixes, as if the course was conducting entrance examinations everyone failed.

Williams' hot stretch from holes eight through eleven—twelve points including a birdie—showed what happens when competence and confidence briefly align. His 48-point round set the tournament's single-round standard, though contextualized by subsequent events, this feels less like achievement and more like false advertising. The standings showed Mullin still leading both competitions, but the margins were narrowing like a noose.

## Round 3: The Palmares Alvor Massacre {.round3 .round}

The fully parkland Palmares combination brought tree-lined fairways and strategic water, which in practice meant more creative ways to lose golf balls. Alex Baker seized the Trophy lead on the fourth hole's par five, overtaking Mullin through the simple method of not posting a zero. The lead changed hands with the frequency of a tennis match, seven times across the opening fifteen holes, before Baker seized control for good.

John Patterson's twin quintuple bogeys on the eighth and twelfth represented golf as existential horror rather than recreational sport. Both holes yielded zero points, which on Stableford's generous system requires genuine catastrophe. His front nine eighteen points collapsed to a back nine nine points, the sort of numerical decline usually reserved for financial crashes. The fifteenth's quadruple bogey suggested someone actively seeking the tournament's statistical basement.

Baker's own quintuple bogey on the thirteenth briefly threatened his Trophy ambitions before Williams' simultaneous blow-up proved everyone was suffering equally. Mullin's birdies on fifteen and seventeen showed flashes of competence amid the chaos, though his zero-pointers on four, nine, eleven, thirteen, and eighteen suggested mortality was winning. His 31-point round dropped him to third in Stableford whilst maintaining Jacket dominance, a split personality performance that captured the tournament's essential weirdness.

The round ended with Baker and Williams deadlocked atop the Trophy leaderboard, a statistical photo finish heading into the final eighteen. Mullin's gross lead remained unthreatened despite his Stableford collapse, which is the TEG way: one competition's disaster is another's procession. Jon Baker's recovery from early blow-ups showed resilience; Patterson's late implosion showed surrender.

## Round 4: The Boavista Reckoning {.round4 .round}

Alex Baker's closing 51 points set a new all-time TEG single-round record, which sounds impressive until you remember that Stableford points are essentially participation trophies with mathematical structure. His victory march featured four-point hauls on holes six, seven, and ten—consecutive pars rendered heroic by context—before a quintuple bogey on fifteen briefly threatened to make things interesting. Williams' simultaneous collapse removed all drama.

John Patterson's sextuple bogey on the eighth hole—eleven strokes, six over par, zero points—represented not merely bad golf but active psychological warfare against himself. His quadruple bogey on the tenth and blow-ups on seventeen and eighteen suggested someone who'd stopped pretending to care around hole seven. Six catastrophic holes across the final round is less a performance and more a cry for help disguised as sport.

Gregg Williams' co-leadership lasted precisely one hole before a bogey on the first signaled what was coming. His birdie on the fifth briefly rekindled hope before blow-ups on six and eighteen bookended his round like tragic punctuation marks. Starting the day tied for the lead and finishing eleven points behind represents the sort of collapse that requires professional counseling or at least a lengthy pub session.

David Mullin's 40-point final round secured his eighth Green Jacket by twelve strokes, a margin suggesting dominance until you note his wire-to-wire Jacket lead contrasted with never holding the Trophy lead after Round 2. His birdie on the sixteenth showed class; Baker's four-point streak from holes six through ten showed hunger. The final standings revealed what four rounds of Portuguese golf produces: one breakthrough winner, one wire-to-wire Jacket champion, and four players contemplating their life choices.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Alex Baker's maiden Trophy victory arrived via the least dramatic route possible: consistent mediocrity beating everyone else's spectacular inconsistency. His scores of 41-45-47-51 showed someone slowly figuring out Portuguese golf's particular cruelties, though "figuring out" might be generous when 184 total points across 72 holes represents roughly 2.5 points per hole. His breakthrough ended a three-tournament runner-up streak that must have felt less like near-misses and more like cosmic mockery.

David Mullin's eighth Green Jacket came through wire-to-wire dominance that never translated to Trophy leadership, a split performance that perfectly captures amateur golf's beautiful absurdism. Leading all 72 holes in gross competition whilst finishing third in Stableford suggests either tactical brilliance or fundamental confusion about which competition matters. His final margin of twelve strokes whispered quality; his Stableford fade to third screamed human.

The tournament's lasting image belongs to John Patterson's final-round sextuple bogey, the sixth catastrophic hole in his closing eighteen and twentieth zero-pointer of the tournament. Finishing seventy-two points behind the winner represents not merely bad golf but an entirely different relationship with the sport, one based on suffering rather than recreation. His Wooden Spoon came with historical context: every round set new personal worsts.

Gregg Williams' collapse from co-leader to eleven points back tells its own story about golf's essential cruelty, whilst Jon Baker's runner-up finishes in both competitions suggest someone perpetually close but never quite there. The Algarve sunshine witnessed all this with Mediterranean indifference, which feels appropriate: these are self-inflicted wounds wearing Stableford's bureaucratic formatting.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

### Consistency Metrics
The ten-point spread between Alex Baker's best and worst rounds (41-51) proved decisive against Gregg Williams' identical range (38-48) that somehow arrived at different places. John Patterson's nineteen-point collapse from Round 2's respectable 35 to Round 4's catastrophic 21 suggests someone whose relationship with golf is fundamentally unstable. David Mullin's eighteen-point drop from opening 49 to closing 40 showed even quality suffers in the Algarve.

### Catastrophic Hole Distribution
Twenty zero-point holes for Patterson across four rounds averages five per eighteen, which represents statistical consistency in precisely the wrong direction. His six blow-ups in the final round alone constitutes one-third of all holes played, the sort of ratio that prompts existential questions. Stuart Neumann's eleven zero-pointers finished distant second in this particular competition nobody wants to win.

### Lead Changes and Final Margins
Seven Trophy lead changes through Round 3 before Baker's final-day breakaway suggests a tournament defined more by others' collapses than his dominance. His eleven-point victory margin looks comfortable until you remember he was tied entering the final round. Williams' simultaneous implosion handed Baker the Trophy as much as Baker seized it, which is amateur golf's essential truth: victories arrive via others' failures.

### Front Nine vs Back Nine Patterns
Round 1 saw three players post stronger back nines (Mullin, Baker, Patterson) whilst two started strong (J. Baker, Neumann), suggesting Boavista operates as slow torture rather than immediate cruelty. Round 4's remarkable balance—everyone within three points between nines—indicates either course fairness or universal suffering. These patterns matter deeply to precisely nobody.
