## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Five years after TEG 5, the fraternity returned to Portugal's Algarve coast to discover that neither the courses nor their own limitations had improved with age. Alex Baker finally converted chronic runner-up syndrome into actual silverware, overcoming an eight-point first-round deficit through the revolutionary tactic of not completely imploding when it mattered. David Mullin, meanwhile, conducted a wire-to-wire gross masterclass that somehow left him third in the actual competition, proving once again that playing well and winning are separate disciplines entirely.

The tournament featured 72 holes across Boavista's parkland elegance and Palmares' various configurations of suffering. What emerged was less a golf competition and more a four-act tragedy examining how hope gradually dies over 72 holes. By Round 4, John Patterson had authored a performance so comprehensively catastrophic that calling it a "meltdown" feels like calling the Titanic's voyage "slightly delayed."

## Round 1: The Optimism Symposium {.round1 .round}

Boavista Golf Resort opened its arms to six men who genuinely believed this time would be different. The Atlantic gleamed in the distance, the fairways lay immaculate, and nobody had yet scored a ten on a par five. Hope, that most dangerous of emotions, hung thick in the Portuguese air.

David Mullin immediately declared his intentions with a first-hole par that felt, in context, like a birdie. By the sixth, he'd claimed the Jacket lead through the simple expedient of hitting fairways and greens with the consistency of a metronome. His playing partners watched this display of competence with the facial expressions of men witnessing something they'd only read about in theory. Three consecutive birdies from Hole 13 suggested Mullin had mistaken this for an actual golf tournament rather than a mutual support group for people with swing thoughts.

Elsewhere, the traditional first-round chaos unfolded with baroque creativity. Stuart Neumann recorded a nine on the par-five third, having apparently decided that Stableford points were overrated. Alex Baker and John Patterson both found seven on the second hole, a par three offering roughly 160 yards of straightforward golf. The fact that they made this journey together speaks to either genuine friendship or shared delusion. By the eighth, Patterson had achieved a perfect ten, which in golf is considerably less impressive than in gymnastics.

The back nine witnessed multiple lead changes as players discovered that golf remains difficult even in Portugal. Alex Baker briefly held the Trophy lead at the eleventh before recording a seven two holes later, demonstrating the emotional range of a man who'd just remembered he was playing golf. Mullin closed with 49 points, an eight-point cushion that felt insurmountable until everyone remembered there were 54 holes remaining.

## Round 2: The Hope Adjustment Period {.round2 .round}

Palmares Golf's Praia-Alvor combination arrived like a plot twist nobody requested. The routing mixed parkland restraint with seaside links chaos, ensuring that no player could settle into comfortable mediocrity. This was democracy in action: everyone would suffer differently.

Jon Baker opened with a birdie on the second, suggesting dangerous competence. Gregg Williams responded with his own birdie at the tenth, accompanied by a five-pointer on the ninth, because apparently some people had decided to play actual golf. His 48 points represented the round's high-water mark, a number that would haunt him 36 holes later when he remembered it was possible.

Alex Baker posted 45 points to draw level with Jon for second place overall, managing this through the sophisticated strategy of not completely falling apart. His front nine featured 28 points, which in Stableford terms counts as sustained excellence. That he followed this with 17 on the back suggests either fatigue or the dawning realisation that he was playing well, which historically triggers immediate collapse.

Mullin maintained his five-point cushion despite a relatively pedestrian 42 points. His gross lead remained unthreatened as he continued treating par as a floor rather than a ceiling. Behind him, the Trophy race had become a genuine contest involving four players separated by eleven points. Mathematical hope remained alive.

John Patterson contributed 35 points, which in isolation seems respectable until you remember he'd opened with a ten on the first hole. The man possessed either remarkable resilience or simply hadn't noticed.

## Round 3: The Reckoning Approaches {.round3 .round}

Palmares' Alvor-Lagos routing arrived as the tournament entered its philosophical phase, where players confronted not just bad shots but the existential implications of their golfing ambitions. The course featured tree-lined fairways and strategic water hazards, which is technical language for "places your ball will definitely visit."

Alex Baker and Gregg Williams both posted 47 points, drawing level atop the leaderboard in what felt like two men agreeing to jump off a cliff simultaneously. Baker achieved this despite opening with a seven and later recording a catastrophic ten on the par-five thirteenth after holding the lead. Losing a five-shot advantage in one hole represents efficiency in reverse, the kind of productivity normally reserved for dismantling furniture.

Williams took the lead at the thirteenth through the simple method of not making ten. Leadership in amateur golf often comes through survival rather than excellence. He then birdied the seventeenth to maintain his share of first place, because occasionally someone remembers how golf works.

David Mullin's 31 points represented his personal low-water mark for the week, a score that would finish last in any round yet somehow left him still leading the Jacket by a street. His gross advantage had become so comprehensive that even mediocrity couldn't threaten it. Three blow-ups across the middle holes suggested even metronomes occasionally skip.

John Patterson, meanwhile, had discovered quintuple bogeys. Two of them. On the eighth and twelfth holes, he recorded fives over par with the consistency of a man following a blueprint. Between holes ten and fifteen, he accumulated four points from six holes, which mathematically shouldn't be possible but somehow was. His front nine produced 18 points; his back nine, nine. The symmetry feels deliberate.

## Round 4: The Day Hope Went to Die {.round4 .round}

Boavista returned for the finale like an old friend who'd witnessed too much. The parkland layout offered no particular menace, which meant any disasters would be entirely self-administered. This is golf's cruelest joke: the course doesn't need to be hard when you're perfectly capable of destroying yourself.

Alex Baker opened with solid golf, watching Gregg Williams immediately blow up on the first with a six. Leadership through attrition. Williams briefly reclaimed the lead with a birdie on the fifth before recording seven on the sixth, which in narrative terms represents hubris meeting nemesis at walking pace. Baker responded with consecutive four-pointers on the sixth and seventh, building a cushion that would prove insurmountable.

His 51 points didn't just win the round; it shattered his personal best and set an all-time TEG record. The man had spent three rounds learning how not to lose before finally remembering how to win. His consistency across 72 holes ranged from 41 to 51 points, a ten-point spread that in amateur golf terms counts as robotic precision.

Mullin closed with 40 points and a birdie on the sixteenth, sealing his eighth Jacket with 12 strokes to spare over Jon Baker. He'd led every gross hole since the opening round, a 68-hole streak of sustained competence that feels almost insulting in context. His +51 total represented scoring excellence; his third place in Stableford demonstrated that golf contains multiple realities.

Williams finished with 40 points and second place, eleven points behind Baker. His final round featured blow-ups on holes one, six, and eighteen, suggesting the pressure of co-leading had triggered a controlled detonation. Jon Baker also posted 40 to claim Jacket runner-up, having never seriously threatened either title but maintained respectability throughout.

And then there was John Patterson. His final round produced 21 points and six blow-ups, including a sextuple bogey on the eighth hole. A sextuple represents such comprehensive failure it deserves its own Wikipedia entry. Combined with quintuple bogeys in Round 3, he'd recorded three scores of five-over or worse across the final 36 holes. His closing 18 featured five zero-point holes and finished 72 points behind the winner, 32 behind fifth place. This wasn't just losing; this was performance art exploring the limits of scorable golf.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Alex Baker's maiden Trophy victory arrived after three consecutive runner-up finishes and one Wooden Spoon, suggesting perseverance eventually defeats psychological trauma. His 184-point total and 11-point margin represented controlled excellence, the kind achieved by remembering that golf's cruelty can be managed rather than eliminated. That his best round came under maximum pressure speaks either to character or selective amnesia about what golf normally does to him.

David Mullin's eighth Jacket arrived through gross scoring that left everyone else playing a different sport. His 12-stroke margin and complete dominance represented wire-to-wire excellence, though his third-place Stableford finish proves that different scoring systems produce different realities. Three birdies in Round 1, followed by steady accumulation, demonstrated that sometimes golf rewards the competent rather than the merely hopeful.

Gregg Williams' 11-point defeat came through late blow-ups that transformed co-leadership into minor heartbreak. His 48-point second round showed what was possible; his final-round collapse showed what was probable. Jon Baker's runner-up Jacket finish via consistent mediocrity deserves acknowledgement for its honesty.

But this tournament ultimately belongs to John Patterson, whose 72-point deficit and 20 zero-point holes across four rounds created a Wooden Spoon margin so comprehensive it deserves permanent exhibition. His final-round sextuple bogey represented not just bad golf but a complete philosophical rejection of scoring conventions. That he continued after the third-round quintuple bogeys speaks to courage, delusion, or simply not knowing you're allowed to quit.

Portugal had returned. Golf remained difficult. Some learned how to manage it. Others provided cautionary tales.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Alex BAKER (1st):** Maiden Trophy secured through the revolutionary tactic of not imploding catastrophically when it mattered most, despite obvious temptation. His record-breaking 51-point finale demonstrated that sometimes the brain forgets to sabotage the swing. Three previous runner-up finishes finally converted to silverware through ten-point consistency and only four disasters across 72 holes.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd):** Co-leading into the final round before blow-ups on holes one, six, and eighteen demonstrated that hope remains golf's most dangerous emotion. His 48-point second round and 173-point total represented genuine excellence betrayed by precisely-timed catastrophes. Four birdies suggest competence exists; 11-point defeat suggests it occasionally takes lunch breaks.

**David MULLIN (3rd):** Eight Jacket secured via 12-stroke dominance that somehow left him bronze in the actual competition, proving golf contains multiple realities that never quite align. Led 68 of 72 gross holes through the sophisticated strategy of hitting fairways and occasionally remembering birdie exists. Six total birdies and complete wire-to-wire control offset by Stableford scoring that treated par as disappointingly average.

**Jon BAKER (4th):** Runner-up Jacket via 12-stroke deficit and consistent mediocrity that at least committed to its premise. Brief first-round leadership immediately abandoned upon remembering this required sustained excellence. Round 2 birdie and multiple four-pointers demonstrated occasional competence undermined by architectural blow-ups at precisely wrong moments.

**Stuart NEUMANN (5th):** Managed respectability despite 11 zero-point holes and opening-round nine that suggested preliminary research into course layout might have helped. His consistency operated in wrong direction, steadily accumulating disasters with democratic enthusiasm. Zero birdies across 72 holes represents commitment to mediocrity that demands grudging respect.

**John PATTERSON (6th):** Wooden Spoon secured through methods that must be studied by future generations of disaster architects. Twenty zero-point holes, including a sextuple bogey finale and multiple quintuple achievements, created a 72-point losing margin that transcends mere bad golf and enters performance art territory. That he recorded 29 points in Round 1 makes subsequent collapse feel intentionally cruel.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Consistency Analysis:**
Alex Baker's ten-point range (41-51) represented remarkable stability for someone whose previous TEG performances included Wooden Spoon contention. Gregg Williams matched this spread (38-48) yet finished 11 points behind, proving narrow ranges mean nothing when they occur at wrong moments.

**Disaster Accumulation:**
John Patterson's 20 zero-point holes across 72 holes represented 27.8% of his tournament played at complete failure rate. Stuart Neumann's 11 such holes feels almost competent by comparison. Alex Baker limited disasters to four holes total, demonstrating that winning involves primarily not losing catastrophically.

**Front-Nine Dominance:**
Round 2 witnessed extreme splits: Alex Baker (28 front, 17 back), Jon Baker (27 front, 18 back), suggesting Palmares' Praia-Alvor routing exhausted everyone systematically. Round 3 reversed this for Patterson (18 front, 9 back), indicating collapse can occur in any direction given sufficient commitment.

**Birdie Distribution:**
David Mullin accumulated six birdies across four rounds, with three arriving in opening 18 holes. Gregg Williams posted four, Jon Baker one. This disparity suggests some players occasionally remember golf can be played well rather than merely survived.

**The Comeback Blueprint:**
Alex Baker's eight-point first-round deficit converted to 11-point victory represents 19-point swing across 54 holes, achieved through grinding consistency rather than explosive brilliance. His worst round (41) exceeded Patterson's best (35), demonstrating that floors matter more than ceilings.

**Gross-Stableford Paradox:**
David Mullin's wire-to-wire Jacket dominance (+51, winning by 12) contrasted with third-place Trophy finish (162 points, 22 behind) suggests handicap mathematics contain mysterious properties that reward different behaviours. That both competitions occurred simultaneously on identical holes feels almost satirical.
