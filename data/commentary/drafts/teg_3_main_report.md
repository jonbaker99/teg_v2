## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker claimed his maiden TEG Trophy with a performance of ruthless efficiency, leading from the opening hole to secure victory by 17 points. David Mullin collected his second Green Jacket with similarly commanding control, holding a 12-stroke margin at Boavista Golf & Spa Resort's Atlantic-facing parkland layout. Baker seized both leads on the first hole and never relinquished the Stableford crown, extending his advantage with each successive round. Mullin lost the gross lead briefly but reclaimed it permanently by the fourth hole, constructing an unassailable position through measured excellence. The tournament proved a tale of contrasts: Baker's relentless consistency against a backdrop of widespread carnage, with only five birdies recorded across 360 holes. Stuart Neumann's tournament collapsed spectacularly on the 17th hole of the final round, a quintuple-bogey catastrophe that delivered him the Wooden Spoon despite an otherwise solid showing.

## Round 1: Baker Seizes Control {.round1 .round}

Baker opened with authority at Boavista, where Howard Swan's parkland design splits into distinct sections beneath Atlantic views. The Trophy and Jacket races began simultaneously, both leads established on the opening hole.

Baker's opening statement lasted exactly four holes. He claimed both competitions with a regulation par at the first, though Mullin snatched the Jacket lead at the short fourth. Henry Meller briefly held the gross advantage at the same hole but surrendered it immediately with a double at the fifth. Chaos erupted at the Par 3 sixth. Baker, Meller and Gregg Williams all imploded, with Williams recording a quadruple. Mullin capitalised to take the Trophy lead, but lost it just as quickly when he bogeyed the seventh. Baker reclaimed the Stableford crown and would never release his grip. The back nine brought Meller's birdie at the 16th, the tournament's first. His celebration proved premature. At the 17th he posted 12, an eight-over-par horror show that obliterated his challenge. Williams endured his own nightmare finish, recording blow-ups at both the 17th and 18th to compound earlier misery at the 10th and 15th.

Baker closed on 45 points, eight clear of Mullin's 37. Mullin held the Jacket by a single stroke from Baker, with Neumann three back. Meller sat fourth in both competitions after his late-round implosion, whilst Williams occupied last place in both standings following six blow-ups.

## Round 2: Meller's Surge Falls Short {.round2 .round}

Baker extended his advantage as Meller produced the tournament's most compelling subplot. The overnight leaders entered the second circuit knowing that Boavista's front nine offered scoring opportunities before the sterner back-nine examination.

Meller exploded into life between the fourth and ninth holes, averaging level par across the stretch. His birdie at the fifth, the tournament's second, sparked an 18-point haul over six holes. The charge threatened Baker's cushion but never genuinely imperilled his position. Baker matched Meller's 38-point return to stretch his Trophy lead from eight to 11 points. Williams collapsed between the eighth and 13th, managing just six points as back-to-back blow-ups at the 10th and 11th wrecked his momentum. Neumann posted three disasters including a triple at the third, whilst Mullin's solid golf featured a solitary blemish. His nine at the 17th, a five-over nightmare that surrendered five points, proved the round's most damaging single hole. Williams matched his misery at the same venue, posting his own triple. The 18th brought further carnage: Mullin, Meller and Baker all recorded sevens in a collective stumble to the clubhouse.

Baker's 11-point Trophy advantage over Mullin appeared unassailable with 36 holes remaining. Mullin maintained his Jacket supremacy at 38 over par, eight clear of the resurgent Meller.

## Round 3: Baker Pulls Clear, Mullin Cruises {.round3 .round}

Baker's third-round 45 matched his opening salvo and stretched his Trophy margin to an insurmountable 16 points. Mullin's 14 over par secured a flawless Jacket performance, his worst gross score of four rounds yet still comfortable.

The round began with immediate chaos. Meller posted a triple at the first, Williams and Baker both recorded blow-ups at the second, then Meller imploded completely at the third with a 10. His quintuple bogey surrendered five points and any remaining Trophy ambitions. Baker suffered his own nightmare at the fifth, an eight delivering four over par. Yet his cushion absorbed the damage. Williams opened with close to three over per hole across the first three, whilst Neumann's triple at the ninth contributed to a consistent pattern of carnage. Meller found redemption with back-to-back birdies at the 11th and 12th, clawing 14 under for the short stretch. Baker responded with 18 points between the sixth and 11th, then 18 again from the seventh to 12th, both sequences featuring multiple four-point returns. His closing quintuple at the 18th merely trimmed his victory margin slightly rather than threatening his position.

Mullin's measured 40 points and plus-14 gross consolidated both his Jacket lead and second place in the Trophy race. Baker stood 16 points clear with 18 holes remaining, whilst Mullin held a nine-stroke Jacket advantage over Neumann.

## Round 4: Neumann's Catastrophe Seals Spoon {.round4 .round}

Baker coasted to his 17-point coronation with a closing 36, whilst Neumann's tournament collapsed in spectacular fashion. The final round at Boavista delivered one of the competition's most dramatic single-hole disasters.

Baker and Neumann both opened with triples at the first, an immediate statement that perfection remained elusive. Baker recovered with four-point hauls at the eighth and 16th, the latter a Par 5 where consistency rather than brilliance sufficed. Williams endured another wretched afternoon, recording blow-ups at the third, seventh and 12th. Meller matched his misery at the seventh, both men posting eights in an identical meltdown. The 11th brought shared pain for Baker and Mullin, both recording disasters at the short hole. Neumann appeared to have salvaged his round with a birdie at the 16th, the tournament's fifth and final sub-par score. He stepped to the 17th needing solid golf to secure fourth place. What followed proved catastrophic. His 10, a six-over-par quintuple bogey, obliterated his standing and delivered the Wooden Spoon. From potential respectability to last place in a single hole.

Baker's 164 points secured the Trophy by 17 from Mullin. Mullin's plus-72 gross claimed the Jacket by 12 strokes from Neumann, whose late collapse saw him finish on 84 over par. Williams recorded 11 blow-ups across 72 holes yet still avoided the Spoon.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's maiden Trophy triumph established a new standard for dominance in TEG competition. Leading all 72 holes from his opening par, Baker never faced genuine challenge as he extended his advantage from eight to 11 to 16 to 17 points across four rounds. His 164-point total featured three scores in the forties, a testament to relentless consistency in conditions that produced widespread carnage. David Mullin's second Jacket proved equally emphatic, leading 69 of 72 holes gross and cruising home 12 strokes clear. His worst round, a 14 over par in Round 3, would have satisfied most competitors as their best.

The tournament's defining characteristic emerged in its birdie famine: just five sub-par holes across 360 played. Henry Meller collected four, including back-to-back red numbers in Round 3, yet finished fourth after recording 10 blow-ups. Stuart Neumann's single birdie at the penultimate hole of the final round offered cruel irony, arriving one hole before his tournament-wrecking 10 at the 17th delivered the Wooden Spoon. Gregg Williams's 11 disasters across four rounds represented the field's most volatile performance, his wildly erratic golf contrasting sharply with Baker's metronomic accumulation.

Baker's wire-to-wire perfection, achieved without ever trailing, marked the most commanding Trophy victory in the nascent series. His victory margin of 17 points, secured despite losing the Jacket lead after four holes, demonstrated the virtue of steady excellence over sporadic brilliance. At Boavista's Atlantic-facing layout, consistency conquered chaos.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (1st):** Claimed his maiden Trophy with ruthless wire-to-wire dominance, leading all 72 holes and extending his advantage each round. Three rounds in the forties secured a 17-point margin. Lost the Jacket lead on the fourth hole of the tournament and never recovered it, finishing fifth in gross despite his Stableford supremacy.

**David MULLIN (2nd Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Collected his second Green Jacket with commanding authority, holding a 12-stroke advantage. Led 69 of 72 holes gross, surrendering the lead only briefly in Round 1. His worst round, plus-14 in Round 3, illustrated the consistency that secured comfortable victory. Finished runner-up in the Trophy race, 17 points adrift.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd):** Endured the field's most volatile performance, recording 11 blow-ups across four rounds yet avoiding the Wooden Spoon. Front-nine strength in Rounds 1 and 2 provided foundations that back-nine collapses repeatedly demolished. Finished third in the Trophy on 138 points but last in the Jacket at 127 over par.

**Henry MELLER (4th):** Recorded the tournament's most birdies with four, including consecutive red numbers in Round 3, yet finished fourth after 10 disasters undermined his brilliance. His Round 1 quintuple at the 17th and Round 3 horror at the third epitomised the volatility that prevented a stronger challenge.

**Stuart NEUMANN (5th):** His lone birdie at the 16th of the final round preceded immediate catastrophe. The quintuple bogey at the 17th, a six-over nightmare, destroyed his tournament and delivered the Wooden Spoon. Had appeared solid for four rounds minus one hole, but that single blow-up proved decisive.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Baker's 72-hole lead represents the longest unbroken spell atop the Trophy standings in series history. His three rounds of 45 points equal the single-round record he established in Round 1 and matched in Round 3. Mullin's Jacket dominance saw him lead for 69 of 72 holes, losing the advantage only between holes four and seven of the opening round. The birdie drought of five across 360 holes marks the lowest rate in TEG competition. Williams's 11 blow-ups represented nearly one disaster every 6.5 holes. Meller's four birdies accounted for 80 per cent of the tournament's total yet couldn't overcome his 10 disasters. Neumann's final-hole capitulation delivered the most dramatic Wooden Spoon outcome yet witnessed, transforming respectability into ignominy in a single catastrophic quintuple.
