## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker claimed his maiden Trophy with the most commanding performance in series history, leading every single hole from opening tee shot to final putt at Boavista. The parkland course offered stunning Atlantic views but precious few scoring opportunities. Baker seized both competitions at the first hole, never relinquished the Trophy lead, and cruised to a 17-point victory over David Mullin.

Mullin's second Green Jacket arrived via a different route. Baker lost the gross lead after five holes and never reclaimed it. Mullin held a commanding 12-stroke cushion at the finish, his worst round a creditable 14 over par in the third. Stuart Neumann's promising challenge imploded spectacularly at the penultimate hole of Round Four, a quintuple-bogey catastrophe that gifted him the Wooden Spoon. The tournament belonged to Baker from the moment he stepped onto the first tee.

## Round 1: Early Stranglehold {.round1 .round}

Baker opened with authority at Boavista, claiming both Trophy and Jacket leads with a level-par four at the opening hole. The Atlantic breeze offered no mercy to the rest of the field. Baker's 45 points established an eight-point cushion by day's end, though his gross lead evaporated when Mullin found his rhythm from the fourth hole onwards.

The lead battle stabilised early. Mullin briefly held the Trophy advantage through the sixth hole before Baker reclaimed it at the seventh and never looked back. Henry Meller threatened the Jacket lead twice through five holes but couldn't sustain the pressure. His birdie at the 16th, worth four points, hinted at a challenge before the wheels came off at the next. An eight-over-par 12 destroyed his momentum completely.

Gregg Williams suffered through a nightmare back nine. He registered blow-ups at the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th holes, failing to score a single point over the final three. The closing stretch turned into a horror show. His front nine had promised so much more.

Baker's 45 points matched his personal best and set a new all-time TEG record. Mullin's 17 over gross also established a new benchmark, though he trailed Baker by eight points in the Trophy race. The gap already looked ominous.

## Round 2: Meller Surges, Baker Extends {.round2 .round}

Baker extended his Trophy lead to 11 points despite matching Meller's 38-point haul in Round Two. The margin grew because Mullin's challenge faltered with 35 points, his round sabotaged by catastrophic collapses at the 17th and 18th. A nine at the penultimate hole, five over par, summed up the carnage.

Meller produced the round's most compelling subplot. His birdie at the fifth sparked a blistering spell, 18 points across six holes that briefly made the Trophy race interesting. Level par from the fourth through ninth holes kept him within touching distance in the Jacket standings. Then the 18th arrived. A three-over-par seven ended his momentum.

Williams endured another miserable day, blow-ups at the tenth and 11th yielding precisely one point across the stretch. His only consolation came in matching Mullin's 35 points, though gross scores of 31 over left him dead last in the Jacket race. Baker's triple at the 18th cost him a point but nothing more. The Trophy lead remained unassailable.

Mullin held the Jacket lead at 38 over gross, eight strokes clear of Meller. Baker's cumulative 83 points gave him breathing room few TEG leaders have ever enjoyed. The second round confirmed what the first had suggested. This tournament had a single protagonist.

## Round 3: Mullin's Masterclass, Baker's Cruise {.round3 .round}

Baker's second 45-point round pushed his Trophy advantage to 16 points, a margin bordering on the absurd with 18 holes remaining. Mullin's 40 points kept second place secure but mattered little in the Trophy race. His 14-over-par gross round, however, solidified the Jacket lead with clinical precision.

Meller's round embodied chaos. A quintuple at the third, worth no points, followed blow-ups at the first and sixth. Eight over for the opening six holes seemed terminal. Then came redemption. Back-to-back birdies at the 11th and 12th, one under across three holes, transformed his back nine into a 20-point haul. The front nine yielded just 13.

Williams posted 41 points, his best round of the tournament, yet gained no ground in either competition. Baker survived a five-over-par nine at the 18th, a quintuple blow-up that cost him no points and barely dented his composure. Eighteen points from holes six through 12 had already secured the round. The margin became insurmountable.

Mullin led the Jacket by nine strokes over Neumann, who posted 18 over in Round Three. Baker trailed Mullin by 14 strokes but cared only about the 16-point Trophy cushion. One round remained as a formality.

## Round 4: Neumann's Catastrophe Completes the Story {.round4 .round}

Baker's 36 points in Round Four extended his final margin to 17, the largest Trophy victory the series had witnessed. Mullin's 35 points and 20-over-par gross round completed a comfortable 12-stroke Jacket triumph. The tournament's defining moment, however, belonged to Neumann at the 17th hole.

Neumann stood second in the Jacket race starting the final round. A birdie at the 16th, four points and one under par, suggested a strong finish. Then the 17th arrived. A six-over-par ten, a quintuple blow-up yielding no points, destroyed his tournament in a single catastrophic hole. The Wooden Spoon became his consolation prize.

Baker and Mullin both registered triple bogeys at the first, and blow-ups at the 11th plagued both leaders. Neither wobble mattered. Baker's four-point hauls at the eighth and 16th maintained his cruise control. Mullin's three consecutive pars from the second through fourth kept the Jacket secure. Williams suffered four more blow-ups, his 11th collapse across 72 holes completing the tournament's most volatile performance.

Baker's wire-to-wire perfection never faced a genuine challenge after the opening round. Mullin's Jacket dominance proved equally emphatic once he seized the gross lead through five holes of Round One. The margins told the story. Seventeen points. Twelve strokes. Zero suspense.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's maiden Trophy victory rewrote the series record books with a performance of surgical precision. Leading every single hole of the Trophy competition across four rounds, he never trailed and never faltered when it mattered. His two 45-point rounds in the first and third rounds established TEG benchmarks, while his 164-point total dwarfed David Mullin's 147. The 17-point margin represented the most dominant Trophy win in series history.

Mullin's second Green Jacket arrived via steady excellence rather than spectacular scoring. His worst round, 14 over par in Round Three, would have satisfied most competitors as their best. Leading 69 of 72 holes in the gross competition, he cruised to a 12-stroke victory over Baker despite trailing by 17 points in the Stableford race. The dichotomy illustrated the two competitions' distinct demands perfectly.

Stuart Neumann's tournament will be remembered for a single hole. His quintuple at the 17th in Round Four, six over par and worth no points, transformed a solid performance into Wooden Spoon infamy. Henry Meller's four birdies led the tournament yet couldn't overcome ten blow-ups, a paradox that left him fourth overall. Gregg Williams endured 11 collapses across 72 holes, his volatility making Meller look consistent by comparison.

The birdie famine defined Boavista's challenge. Just five birdies across the entire tournament, four belonging to Meller and one to Neumann. Baker's dominance required no eagles, no spectacular scoring bursts. Just relentless accumulation of points while others imploded. The Atlantic views offered beauty. The course offered no mercy.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (Trophy Winner, T2 Jacket):** A maiden Trophy claimed with the most commanding performance in series history. Led every single hole of the Stableford competition, posted two record-equalling 45-point rounds, and won by 17 points. Lost the Jacket lead after five holes of Round One and never seriously challenged Mullin's gross dominance, finishing 22 strokes back.

**David MULLIN (Trophy Runner-Up, Jacket Winner):** A second Green Jacket secured with ruthless efficiency. Led 69 of 72 holes in the gross competition, never threatened after Round One, and cruised to a 12-stroke victory. His 14-over-par Round Three represented his worst score yet proved more than adequate. Trailed Baker by 17 points in the Trophy race but cared little for Stableford standings.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (T3 Trophy, 5th Jacket):** A tournament of spectacular volatility. Eleven blow-ups across 72 holes produced the field's most erratic performance, yet he finished third in the Trophy race with 138 points. His best round, 41 points in Round Three, showcased occasional brilliance amid consistent chaos. Finished 55 strokes behind Mullin in the Jacket race.

**Henry MELLER (4th Trophy, T4 Jacket):** The tournament's paradox personified. Four birdies, more than the rest of the field combined, couldn't overcome ten blow-ups including an eight-over-par 12 at the 17th in Round One and a five-over-par ten at the third in Round Three. Finished one point behind Williams in the Trophy standings despite leading the field in scoring brilliance.

**Stuart NEUMANN (Wooden Spoon, T3 Jacket):** A promising tournament destroyed by a single catastrophic hole. His quintuple at the 17th in Round Four, six over par and worth no points, dropped him from second in the Jacket race to Wooden Spoon recipient. His lone birdie at the 16th, one hole earlier, made the collapse even crueler.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Birdie Famine:** Only five birdies recorded across 360 holes played. Henry Meller claimed four, Stuart Neumann one. Baker's dominant victory required no sub-par holes.

**Blow-Up Epidemic:** Forty-four scores of triple bogey or worse were recorded. Gregg Williams contributed 11, the most erratic performance in the field.

**Wire-to-Wire Dominance:** Baker led all 72 holes of the Trophy competition, the first player in series history to achieve the feat. His margin of victory, 17 points, also set a new record.

**Jacket Excellence:** David Mullin's worst round, 14 over par in Round Three, would have represented a personal best for three of his four competitors.

**Neumann's Quintuple:** Stuart Neumann's six-over-par ten at the 17th in Round Four marked the joint-worst single-hole score in series history to that point. The collapse cost him second place in the Jacket and earned him the Wooden Spoon.

**Front-Nine Strength:** Three players recorded stronger front-nine performances across multiple rounds. Mullin and Baker both showed front-nine preference in Round Four, while Williams and Meller demonstrated the pattern in Rounds One and Two respectively.
