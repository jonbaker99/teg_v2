# TEG 11: The Baker Brothers, Brotherly Love Meets 27-Point Final Round {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 11 | Catalonia | 2018</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

The experiment began with promise and ended in data. Over four days in Catalonia, Jon BAKER conducted a masterclass in not collapsing, claiming both Trophy and Green Jacket with the administrative efficiency of a man who'd simply decided winning was less stressful than the alternative. He led for 59 of 72 holes in the Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross scoring, establishing what behavioural psychologists would call "dominance" and what everyone else would call "deeply annoying."

Alex BAKER, having mounted the only serious challenge, saved his best work for Round 4 where he posted a career-worst 27 points featuring five triple-bogeys. This represents the golfing equivalent of writing your resignation letter in crayon. Gregg WILLIAMS lurked perpetually in third, never quite leading but never quite imploding, which in TEG terms counts as heroic restraint. David MULLIN earned the Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in gross scoring, proof that excellence in the wrong metric is just failure with better posture.

The return to Catalonia after a five-tournament absence posed questions nobody had asked. Would PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course still be punishing? Yes. Would the new venture to El Prat's Azul Course provide respite? Absolutely not. Would anyone shoot under 82 for a single round? No. Did Jon BAKER equal the course record with an 84 in Round 2? He did, though describing 12-over-par as a record suggests our standards have drifted into medical concern territory.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (Winner, Trophy & Green Jacket):** The wire-to-wire sweep arrived with the emotional affect of a man paying council tax. Two birdies across 72 holes, a Round 2 course-equalling 84, and the psychological warfare of never, ever relinquishing control. His R4 blow-up on the 13th briefly threatened drama before he remembered he was leading by enough to afford recreational catastrophe.

**Alex BAKER (2nd, Trophy):** Led the Trophy standings on exactly two occasions, H1 and H13 of Round 3, both times for roughly as long as it takes to read this sentence. His Round 4 meltdown featured nine zero-point holes and five triple-bogeys, suggesting his short game underwent spontaneous philosophical collapse. Finished six points back having authored the tournament's most compelling tragedy in Stableford scoring.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd, Trophy):** Two birdies, zero leads, permanent third place. The human embodiment of "steady away" played every round between 30 and 39 points, which in amateur golf circles counts as terrifying consistency. His Round 2 blow-up at the 15th (a 10) and birdie at the 17th within three holes captured the essential TEG experience: chaos bookended by competence.

**John PATTERSON (4th, Trophy):** Posted the tournament's best Stableford round (36, R4) immediately after opening with the worst (26, R1). Eight blow-ups in Round 1 alone, including consecutive train wrecks at holes 12, 13, 16, and 17. His scorecard reads like a seismograph during an earthquake, all volatility and no pattern. Led the Trophy for exactly four holes across four rounds, which is four more than most people manage in a lifetime.

**David MULLIN (5th, Trophy / Wooden Spoon):** Finished second in gross scoring but dead last in Stableford, earning the Spoon via the cruelest mathematical logic. Two birdies, multiple stretches of even-par golf, and a Round 3 where he briefly led the Jacket before reality intervened. His tournament arc resembled a man building an intricate sand sculpture during high tide.

## ROUND 1: THE OPTIMISM PURGE {.round1 .round}

PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course opened proceedings with the cheerful aggression of a dental procedure. This is Spain's premier golf course, a World Top 100 layout designed by the European Tour specifically to make professionals feel mortal. For amateurs, it functions as an 18-hole philosophy seminar on accepting human limitation.

John PATTERSON took the Trophy lead at the first hole with four points, which in retrospect represented Peak Ambition. By the fourth, he'd blown up with a nine. By the 13th, he'd added three more catastrophes and sat bottom in the Spoon race, having compiled eight blow-ups before most people have finished breakfast. His front nine produced 17 points. His back nine: nine. The differential suggests someone had swapped his golf clubs for plumbing equipment at the turn.

Gregg WILLIAMS opened with a triple-bogey seven at the first, bottoming out in the Spoon standings before rallying with a birdie at the 15th, then immediately undoing the good work with another triple at the 16th. This is the TEG emotional cycle: hope, achievement, punishment. Alex BAKER blow-ups at the 2nd, 11th, and 13th kept him honest. Jon BAKER, meanwhile, constructed a 35-point round with the quiet brutality of someone who'd done the maths and realised nobody else had.

The round concluded with Jon leading by three points, Dave McDOWELL lurking in the Jacket chase, and John PATTERSON having posted six zero-point holes. The Stadium Course had spoken. Everyone had heard.

## ROUND 2: THE RECORD THAT WASN'T {.round2 .round}

The Tour Course at PGA Catalunya represented Round 2's assignment, marginally less sadistic than its Stadium sibling but only in the way being hit by a van is marginally preferable to being hit by a lorry. Jon BAKER tied the course record with an 84, twelve strokes over par, which tells you everything about the tournament's relationship with conventional excellence.

Alex BAKER posted the round's best Stableford (42 points) before authoring the afternoon's defining moment at the 12th: a nine, five over par, zero points. This dropped him from second to second, which is mathematically fascinating and emotionally devastating. He'd opened with four-point scores at the 3rd, 8th, and 13th, building momentum before the universe reminded him that hope is structural weakness. Jon BAKER birdied the 2nd alongside David MULLIN, who added another at the 10th in a rare display of Gross scoring competence that would later prove cosmically irrelevant.

John PATTERSON contributed five blow-ups including an 11 at the 15th, which represents less a golf hole and more a personal intervention. His scorecard resembled a ransomware note. Gregg WILLIAMS blow-up at the 15th (a 10) preceded a birdie at the 17th, capturing the essential futility of golf: punishment, then redemption, then remembering nobody cares.

Jon BAKER extended his Trophy lead to two points while maintaining the Jacket advantage. His 84 equalled the course record, though describing it as such feels like awarding a participation trophy to mathematics itself.

## ROUND 3: THE BRIEF COUP {.round3 .round}

El Prat's Azul Course made its TEG debut, a Greg Norman design that introduced itself with the warmth of a parking fine. Alex BAKER seized the Trophy lead at the first hole before losing it at the second via a triple-bogey six at a par three. This 18-hole span of leadership represents what military historians would call "premature commitment."

David MULLIN grabbed the Jacket lead at the third, lost it at the sixth following his own par-3 blow-up (a seven). Jon BAKER reclaimed control and refused to release it, like a man who'd learned his lesson about sharing. His birdie at the ninth provided a brief moment of genuine competence before triple-bogeys at the 12th and 13th reminded everyone that gravity remains undefeated.

But Alex BAKER's blow-up at the 13th offered Jon the opening. Alex took back the Trophy lead on that same hole with a four-point par, finally seizing the advantage he'd been circling for three rounds. It lasted precisely five holes. John PATTERSON posted the round's best Stableford (39 points) after opening the tournament with 26, which in psychological terms represents either growth or statistical randomness. Gregg WILLIAMS oscillated between blow-ups at the 2nd and 5th (both zero-pointers) and a back-nine 20-point rally that suggested someone had replaced his golf balls with regulation equipment.

David MULLIN's 29-point Stableford round hid his gross-scoring excellence, the cruel maths already writing his Wooden Spoon destiny. Alex BAKER led by two points heading into the final round. Jon BAKER trailed for the first time all tournament. Drama beckoned.

## ROUND 4: THE IMPLOSION PROTOCOLS {.round4 .round}

Back at PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course for the finale, Alex BAKER arrived holding a two-point Trophy lead and the fragile psychology of a man who'd never won before. By the sixth hole, he'd blown up with a seven, scored zero points, and watched Jon BAKER reclaim the lead. He would not recover.

What followed was less golf and more public disintegration. Five triple-bogeys across the round. Nine zero-point holes. A career-worst 27 points from 20 rounds of TEG data. The 9th, 12th, and 17th all delivered blow-ups (eights at par 4s and 5s), each one systematically dismantling his scorecard. This was not choking in the traditional sense. This was voluntary drowning in shallow water.

Jon BAKER posted 35 points, matching his Round 1 total, and sealed the double victory with the emotional affect of someone who'd simply forgotten to panic. His own blow-up at the 13th (an eight) briefly offered hope before everyone realised he was leading by enough to absorb tactical catastrophe. David MULLIN matched Jon's gross score with a +19 round, his best of the tournament, earning him exactly nothing but the Spoon and philosophical perspective on the difference between playing well and scoring well.

John PATTERSON delivered the round's best Stableford (36 points) with three four-point holes, proving that talent exists mainly to make previous incompetence look intentional. Gregg WILLIAMS blow-up at the 10th (a nine) kept him honest. The final standings revealed Jon BAKER six points clear in the Trophy, three strokes ahead in the Jacket, and in possession of both titles without ever having been seriously threatened except by the ghost of Alex BAKER's self-belief.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon BAKER's wire-to-wire double sweep represented the triumph of not losing one's mind, which in amateur golf constitutes elite performance. He led for 59 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross scoring, establishing control in Round 1 and releasing it approximately never. Two birdies across four rounds. A course-equalling 84 in Round 2. The psychological fortitude to watch Alex BAKER's Round 4 meltdown and simply continue playing sensible golf. This is what dominance looks like when nobody's particularly dominant.

Alex BAKER's collapse from Trophy leader to six-point runner-up via a 27-point final round will be studied by sports psychologists for decades, assuming sports psychologists care about amateur golf, which they don't. Five triple-bogeys, nine zero-point holes, a personal worst across 20 rounds of data. He led the Trophy for precisely 13 of 72 holes, all of them in Rounds 3 and 4, which suggests his timing needs recalibration. His tournament arc resembled a man building confidence specifically to ensure the fall hurt more.

The Wooden Spoon going to David MULLIN despite his second-place Jacket finish captured the essential cruelty of Stableford scoring: playing well in the wrong metric is just losing with better optics. Gregg WILLIAMS finished third in both competitions without ever leading either, a feat of competitive invisibility that deserves its own trophy. John PATTERSON's volatility (26 to 39 points across rounds) suggested someone was playing with randomised equipment.

No eagles across 72 holes. Six total birdies. Ninety-six rounds of golf, most of them conducted in a state of controlled panic. Jon BAKER won because everyone else either imploded or forgot to try. Catalonia had spoken. The message was clear: hope is a pre-existing condition, not a treatment plan.

## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}

**TEG Course Records:**
- **PGA Catalunya - Tour Course:** Jon BAKER 84 (+12) - equalled in Round 2. Previously set in TEG 11, also matched by Gregg WILLIAMS, Jon BAKER, and David MULLIN in TEG 12.
- **PGA Catalunya - Stadium Course:** Jon BAKER 89 - prior record from TEG 12, Round 4.

**Personal Worsts:**
- **Alex BAKER:** 27 points (Stableford) in Round 4 - career low across 20 TEG rounds played. Previous worst: substantially higher, presumably.

The course record at PGA Catalunya's Tour Course remains unbroken at 84, which in professional golf would be called "deeply concerning" but in TEG terms represents aspirational excellence. Alex BAKER's personal worst stands as the tournament's defining statistical monument, a 27-point final round that will live in infamy or at least in spreadsheets.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Lead Tenure Analysis:**
- Jon BAKER led the Trophy standings for 59 of 72 holes (82%), losing control only between H13 of Round 3 and H6 of Round 4 when Alex BAKER briefly remembered ambition.
- Jon BAKER led the Jacket for 70 of 72 holes (97%), relinquishing control only at H3-4 of Round 3 to David MULLIN and H3-5 of Round 3 to various challengers, which in governance terms represents a landslide.
- Alex BAKER led the Trophy for 13 holes total, all in the final 23 holes of the tournament, which suggests either late-stage confidence or catastrophically poor timing.

**Front Nine vs Back Nine Divergence:**
- John PATTERSON: 17 points (F9) vs 9 points (B9) in Round 1 (8-point differential), suggesting someone replaced his golf bag at the turn.
- David MULLIN: 18 points (F9) vs 11 points (B9) in Round 3 (7-point differential), proof that starting strong guarantees precisely nothing.
- Gregg WILLIAMS: 15 points (F9) vs 20 points (B9) in Round 3 (negative 5-point differential), a back-nine rally that kept him perpetually third.
- Jon BAKER: 20 points (F9) vs 12 points (B9) in Round 3 (8-point differential), nearly squandering the lead before remembering he was Jon BAKER.

**Blow-Up Distribution:**
- John PATTERSON: 8 triple-bogeys in Round 1 alone, including six zero-point holes, which represents less golf and more performance art.
- Alex BAKER: 5 triple-bogeys in Round 4, featuring 9 zero-point holes, the statistical signature of competitive self-harm.
- Tournament-wide: Zero eagles. Six birdies. Approximately 47 triple-bogeys or worse, which in density terms qualifies as an epidemic.

**Birdie Scarcity Index:**
- Six birdies across 360 holes played (1.67% birdie rate), suggesting par is an aspirational concept rather than a baseline expectation.
- Jon BAKER: 2 birdies. Gregg WILLIAMS: 2 birdies. David MULLIN: 2 birdies. Everyone else: busy trying not to make nines.

**Gross Scoring Futility vs Stableford Success Paradox:**
- David MULLIN finished 2nd in Jacket (+73 gross) but 5th in Trophy (125 points), earning the Spoon via the cruelest application of mathematics since calculus was invented.
- This represents the TEG achievement gap: playing objectively better golf while scoring objectively fewer points, which is either profound irony or structural injustice depending on one's philosophical orientation.

**Round Volatility Coefficient:**
- John PATTERSON's 13-point range (26 to 39 points) across rounds suggests either personal growth or complete randomness.
- Alex BAKER's 15-point range (27 to 42 points) captured the full human experience: competence, confidence, collapse.
- Jon BAKER's 9-point range (32 to 41 points) represented the boring tyranny of consistency, which in competitive terms is unbeatable and in narrative terms is intolerable.

The data suggests that amateur golf remains a voluntary experiment in managing expectations downward while simultaneously believing, against all available evidence, that this time will be different. It won't be. It never is. That's why we play.
