## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker controlled this tournament with the pitiless efficiency of a man reading terms and conditions he's already agreed to. He led 70 of 72 holes in the Jacket competition and 59 of 72 in the Trophy standings. These are not the numbers of drama. These are the numbers of inevitability.

His brother Alex mounted the only credible challenge, briefly seizing the Trophy lead in Round 3 before engineering a final-day capitulation so comprehensive it entered the record books as his career-worst performance across 20 rounds. Twenty-seven points. Five triple-bogeys. Nine zero-point holes. This was not golf. This was performance art titled "Hope Confronting Reality."

David Mullin finished second in gross scoring but dead last in Stableford, earning the Wooden Spoon despite playing objectively excellent golf. The cognitive dissonance required to process this outcome may have caused permanent neurological damage. Jon Baker meanwhile equalled the course record with an 84 in Round 2, then sealed his wire-to-wire double sweep with the calm of a man ticking boxes on a checklist he wrote himself.

## Round 1: The Establishment of Natural Order {.round1 .round}

PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course opened proceedings with its usual air of menace. This is Spain's premier championship test, a course designed by the European Tour to hurt feelings. John Patterson began by scoring four points on the opening hole, briefly occupying first place like a man who'd wandered into the wrong meeting.

By the fourth hole, Patterson had posted a quintuple-bogey and surrendered the lead he'd held for approximately twelve minutes. Jon Baker seized control and would not relinquish it for the remainder of the tournament. Think about that. Seventy-one holes of golf followed. He led for effectively all of them.

Gregg Williams produced the round's only birdie, a fleeting moment of competence on the par-five 15th that was immediately bookended by a triple-bogey on 16. Patterson, meanwhile, embarked upon a statistical journey into the outer darkness. Eight blow-ups. Six zero-point holes. His scorecard read like a ransom note written by someone who'd stopped caring about getting paid.

Williams and Alex Baker also contributed triple-bogeys on the second hole, a par-four that appeared to have been secretly redesigned overnight into a par-seven. The back nine became a theater of mutual destruction. Patterson collapsed completely between holes 12 and 17, posting three points across six holes. This was not a cold spell. This was hypothermia.

Jon Baker closed with his own triple-bogey on 18, a reminder that even dominance requires the occasional bow to chaos. He led by three points. Alex sat second, three points clear of Williams. Patterson occupied fifth, nine points adrift and presumably questioning every life choice that had led to this moment.

## Round 2: The Course Record Nobody Will Remember {.round2 .round}

The Tour Course at PGA Catalunya presented marginally less terrifying dimensions, though this is like saying a tiger is marginally less dangerous than a lion. Jon Baker opened with a birdie on the par-three second. David Mullin matched it. This felt significant for approximately four minutes.

What followed was an 84, equalling the all-time TEG course record. Baker had now tied the best gross round ever recorded in tournament history. He extended his Trophy lead. He maintained his Jacket advantage. He did this while apparently expending the emotional energy of a man ordering lunch.

Alex Baker posted the round's best Stableford score, 42 points, keeping himself within two of his brother's lead. This was hopeful. This was delusional. The margins were closing but the trajectory remained unchanged. Gregg Williams added a birdie on 17 after posting a quintuple-bogey on 15, a sequence that suggests a man experiencing golf as a series of unrelated events rather than a coherent narrative.

Patterson's volatility continued. He blow-ups on holes four, five, seven, ten, fifteen, and eighteen. His scorecard resembled a seismograph during an earthquake. Between the disasters, he managed four points on the par-three 11th, a reminder that competence lurked somewhere beneath the chaos.

Baker's round included a triple-bogey on 17, a blemish on an otherwise flawless performance. He led by two. The Jacket standings showed him thirty strokes clear at the cumulative halfway point. The tournament was effectively over. Nobody appeared to have informed the other participants of this fact.

## Round 3: The Brief Flickering of Alternative Outcomes {.round3 .round}

El Prat's Azul Course, a Greg Norman design making its TEG debut, introduced the tournament's only genuine drama. Alex Baker took the Trophy lead on the opening hole with a bogey. Jon Baker immediately reclaimed it on the second when Alex posted a triple-bogey. This was leadership tennis played at speeds suggesting both players were sedated.

David Mullin briefly led the Jacket competition between holes three and five. Brief is the operative word. He surrendered it on the sixth with a quadruple-bogey on the par-three, a score that requires genuine creativity to achieve. Jon Baker reclaimed the Jacket lead and retained it for the final 49 holes of the tournament.

Baker birdied the par-five ninth, his only moment of genuine excellence in a round otherwise defined by survival. He then posted back-to-back triple-bogeys on 12 and 13, the latter handing the Trophy lead to his brother. This was Round 3, hole 13. For approximately five holes, Alex Baker led the tournament.

Patterson contributed a quintuple-bogey on 16, because at this point why not. He also scored four points on 17, immediately afterward, which suggests either remarkable resilience or complete psychological detachment from his own performance. Mullin collapsed on the back nine, posting eleven points after opening with eighteen on the front. Williams did the opposite, scoring twenty on the back after fifteen on the front, because consistency is for people without imaginations.

Baker entered the final round two points behind his brother. The Jacket lead remained his. The margin was seven strokes. The stage was set for a final-day coronation, or alternatively, for Alex Baker to author one of the great collapses in TEG history. Spoiler: it was the second thing.

## Round 4: The Comprehensive Unraveling of Alex Baker {.round4 .round}

The Stadium Course returned for the final round like a headmaster who'd heard about misbehavior in his absence. Alex Baker arrived in first place, two points clear. By the sixth hole he'd posted two triple-bogeys and surrendered the lead. He would not regain it.

What transpired across the following twelve holes represents either the finest satire of human ambition ever performed on a golf course, or a genuine mental health crisis played out in public. Five triple-bogeys or worse. Nine zero-point holes. Twenty-seven points total. This was his career-worst Stableford performance across twenty rounds. Not worst of the year. Not worst of the tournament. Worst ever.

Jon Baker reclaimed the Trophy lead on six when Alex posted his second triple. He extended it methodically, hole by hole, with the emotional affect of a man conducting inventory. His own triple-bogey on thirteen barely registered as a blip. He finished with 35 points and a gross score of 89, tying Mullin for the round's best gross performance while simultaneously crushing all remaining hope in the Stableford standings.

Patterson, in a plot twist nobody requested, posted the round's best Stableford score with 36 points. This included three four-plus point holes and five triple-bogeys, which makes no mathematical sense until you remember that golf is not mathematics. It is psychological warfare conducted with small dimpled spheres.

Williams blow-up with a quintuple-bogey on ten. Mullin started beautifully, even par through three, before collapsing with a triple-bogey on fifteen. His second-place Jacket finish, nineteen strokes better than Baker's winning gross total, earned him the Wooden Spoon. There is no justice in this sport. There is only Stableford.

Baker won by six points. His wire-to-wire dominance was complete. He'd led 59 of 72 holes in the Trophy competition and 70 of 72 in the Jacket. His brother, who'd mounted the only serious challenge, had posted a final round so catastrophic it will be studied by sports psychologists for evidence that hope itself can be weaponized.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's victory was not dramatic. It was gravitational. From the moment he seized the lead in Round 1, the tournament became an exercise in watching other players fail to catch him. Alex Baker came closest, briefly leading in Round 3 before engineering a final-round capitulation so thorough it achieved a kind of terrible beauty.

The course record was equalled but never broken. Six birdies across 72 holes suggests either exceptional course defense or collective incompetence. Probably both. Baker's double sweep represents only the second time in tournament history that one player has claimed both Trophy and Jacket. He did it while leading effectively the entire time.

David Mullin's Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in gross scoring will be remembered as either tragic irony or cosmic justice, depending on your philosophical orientation. Patterson's volatility achieved performance art status, swinging from 26 points to 39 points across rounds with the consistency of a roulette wheel. Williams contributed two birdies and several quintuple-bogeys, maintaining his reputation as a man for whom golf is a series of unconnected emotional experiences.

The margins were never tight. The outcome was never in doubt. This was dominance rendered as procedural inevitability. Golf as managed decline for everyone except the man managing the decline. Seventy-two holes in Catalonia produced one clear winner and four studies in the futility of ambition meeting reality. Welcome to TEG 11, where excellence was rewarded and mediocrity was comprehensively documented for posterity.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (1st - Trophy Winner, Jacket Winner):** Wire-to-wire dominance across both competitions, leading 70 of 72 holes in the Jacket and 59 of 72 in the Trophy. Equalled the course record with an 84 in Round 2, collected two birdies, and dispatched all challengers with the efficiency of a man who'd scheduled this victory eighteen months ago. His final-round 35 points sealed a double sweep that left his brother psychologically demolished and everyone else wondering what second place even means anymore.

**Alex BAKER (2nd):** Briefly led the Trophy competition in Round 3 before authoring a final-round capitulation of such comprehensive devastation it entered the record books as his career-worst performance. Twenty-seven points. Five triple-bogeys. Nine zero-point holes. These numbers suggest a man who stopped believing in golf as a viable concept somewhere around the ninth hole and spent the back nine processing existential questions he hadn't asked since adolescence.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd):** Posted two birdies and multiple quintuple-bogeys, treating the tournament as a series of unconnected events rather than a coherent competitive narrative. Strong back-nine performances in Rounds 2 and 3 kept him relevant without ever threatening actual victory. Finished six points clear of the Wooden Spoon, which represents his greatest achievement of the week.

**John PATTERSON (4th):** Volatility personified. Led the Trophy competition for approximately twelve minutes in Round 1 before posting eight blow-ups and six zero-point holes. Rebounded to win Round 4's Stableford with 36 points, demonstrating either remarkable resilience or complete psychological detachment from his own performance. His 26-to-39-point scoring range suggests golf as experienced through a kaleidoscope during an earthquake.

**David MULLIN (5th - Wooden Spoon Winner):** Finished second in gross scoring, nineteen strokes better than the Jacket winner, and collected the Wooden Spoon for his troubles. This represents either tragic irony or mathematical justice depending on whether you believe Stableford is a legitimate scoring system or an elaborate practical joke. Posted two birdies and briefly led the Jacket before multiple late-tournament blow-ups sentenced him to last place and a lifetime of explaining how he played excellent golf while finishing dead last.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Leadership Dominance:**
Jon Baker led 59 of 72 holes in the Trophy competition and 70 of 72 in the Jacket, establishing the tournament's most comprehensive wire-to-wire performance since records began being kept with obsessive detail.

**Scoring Volatility:**
John Patterson's round scores ranged from 26 to 39 points, a thirteen-point spread suggesting he experienced golf as four separate tournaments happening simultaneously to four different people.

**Blow-Up Frequency:**
Thirty-two triple-bogeys or worse were recorded across the tournament, with Patterson contributing fourteen, Alex Baker eight, and Williams seven. These numbers suggest either exceptional course difficulty or collective panic, likely both.

**Front Nine/Back Nine Patterns:**
Patterson scored seventeen points on Round 1's front nine, then nine on the back. Mullin and Baker both showed strong front-nine tendencies in Round 4, posting nineteen and twenty points respectively before collapsing. Williams repeatedly finished stronger than he started, suggesting he requires nine holes to remember how golf works.

**Birdie Scarcity:**
Six total birdies across 72 holes averages to one birdie per twelve holes, which is either a testament to course defense or evidence that everyone involved should consider taking up a different sport entirely.
