# TEG 6: A Comprehensive Study in Catastrophe Management {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 6 | Catalonia | 2013</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Catalonia provided the setting for golf's most perverse paradox: wire-to-wire dominance achieved through spectacular self-destruction. Gregg Williams led all 72 holes of Trophy competition while simultaneously producing 21 triple-bogeys or worse, culminating in a final round of such sustained violence that statisticians briefly considered developing new notation systems. His 28-point closing act, featuring eight blow-ups, somehow sufficed to hold off Jon Baker by three points. Meanwhile, David Mullin claimed his fourth Green Jacket, establishing himself as the competition's most decorated jacket collector. The Trophy and Jacket split for a third consecutive TEG, suggesting some cosmic principle that excellence in one format automatically triggers mediocrity in the other.

Spain's finest courses witnessed 53 triple-bogeys across four rounds, a new tournament record that speaks either to exceptional difficulty or exceptional talent distribution. Henry Meller collected his third Wooden Spoon despite posting Round 2's best performance, proving that in golf, as in tragedy, one's highest achievement often illuminates one's lowest state.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Gregg Williams (Winner, Trophy):** Led every single hole of the Trophy competition whilst simultaneously conducting a masterclass in brinkmanship, posting both the tournament's best round (48 points) and its worst performance by a winner (28 points, eight blow-ups). His final round resembled a man defusing a bomb by hitting it repeatedly with a hammer until it either explodes or stops ticking. Somehow held off Baker's charge through sheer bloody-mindedness and the occasional reminder that he could, when absolutely necessary, hit a golf ball properly. Twenty-one blow-ups across 72 holes: a new personal standard in volatile excellence.

**David Mullin (Winner, Green Jacket):** Claimed his fourth Green Jacket, more than anyone in TEG history, despite finishing fourth in Stableford competition. Led the gross competition for 62 of 72 holes, losing control only when Baker's late charge forced him to remember he was trying to win something. His Round 3 collapse, featuring three blow-ups in the final six holes including a quadruple on 18, temporarily handed the lead to Baker. Recovered brilliantly in Round 4 with a tournament-best 22-over round, because in golf, "tournament-best" and "+22" can occupy the same sentence without irony dying.

**Jon Baker (Runner-up, Trophy and Jacket):** Came agonisingly close to the double, finishing second in both competitions by three points and four strokes respectively. His final round featured a catastrophic six-over quintuple on the 9th, immediately after taking the lead, suggesting his subconscious had developed a sophisticated early-warning system against success. Posted three blow-ups in Round 4 yet still nearly caught Williams, which tells you everything about the competition's general chaos level. The closest anyone has come to a TEG sweep whilst also demonstrating why sweeps remain theoretical constructs.

**Stuart Neumann (4th, Trophy):** The tournament's model of consistency, never leading either competition but also never quite collapsing into the abyss. Eight blow-ups across 72 holes represented restraint bordering on professionalism. Won Round 3 with 36 points, a score that in any sane universe wouldn't win a church raffle. His two four-point holes in Round 4 briefly suggested competence before reality reasserted itself.

**Henry Meller (Wooden Spoon):** Posted the round of the tournament in Round 2, a magnificent 41 points that momentarily suspended natural law, then immediately returned to type with performances of such sustained mediocrity that his third Wooden Spoon arrived with the inevitability of death and taxes. Fifteen blow-ups, including a sextuple on Round 3's eighth hole, demonstrated commitment to the craft of spectacular failure. Led zero holes across 72, which at least showed consistency.

## Round 1: The Illusion of Control {.round1 .round}

PGA Catalunya's Tour course greeted the field with the sort of benign deception that championship golf does best: wide fairways suggesting forgiveness, greens implying receptiveness, a general aesthetic of playability that lasted precisely until someone attempted to play it. The morning air carried that particular Mediterranean optimism that makes men believe they've suddenly developed competence overnight.

Williams opened with a seven on the first hole, which in retrospect functioned as an amuse-bouche for the chaos to come. Baker matched it immediately, as though they'd agreed beforehand to establish the round's intellectual framework early. David Mullin seized both leads by the third hole, a position he maintained for approximately twelve minutes before posting a quintuple on the short second. Williams took the Jacket lead. Lost it on three. Mullin regained both. This continued with the frantic energy of men playing musical chairs whilst the room fills with water.

By the turn, Williams had settled into a rhythm of controlled aggression interrupted by brief spasms of complete technical collapse. His triple on the eighth, a par three requiring only that one hit the ball towards a large green, suggested existential questions about equipment design. Then came the back nine, where Williams remembered he was supposed to be good at this. Back-to-back birdies on 11 and 14, both par threes, demonstrated his peculiar genius: excellence at holes requiring the fewest decisions. A four-point haul on 15 extended his advantage to unassailable, assuming unassailable means "nine points in a competition where 20-point swings are routine."

Meller collected blow-ups on seven and fifteen with the dedication of a man building a collection. Neumann posted a quintuple on nine that temporarily made everyone else feel better about their own disasters. Baker salvaged a birdie on 17, proving that even in catastrophe, moments of grace occasionally intrude uninvited.

Williams closed with 48 points, the tournament's high-water mark and a personal best that would haunt him by its very existence. Nine points clear, 20-over gross. Behind him, wreckage. Below him, 54 more holes of this.

## Round 2: The Paradox Deepens {.round2 .round}

Costa Brava's woodland parkland layout offered a different flavour of suffering: trees that appeared decorative until you required them not to be in the way, a front nine demanding thought, a back nine suggesting relaxation whilst punishing complacency. The sort of course design that philosophy professors might study for insights into the problem of free will.

Williams's blow-up epidemic began immediately, a triple on the second hole that Baker matched with admirable synchronicity. By the seventh, Williams had accumulated six scorecard atrocities, transforming his nine-point cushion into an anxiety disorder with numeric expression. Each disaster raised the same question: how does one maintain a lead whilst actively attempting to destroy it? His birdie on 17 arrived with the timing of a man remembering an important appointment seconds before missing it entirely.

Meller posted the round of the tournament, 41 points of sustained competence that briefly suggested he'd been replaced by a more capable twin. Four points on the 12th, a par four requiring only that one avoid catastrophic decision-making, represented the day's high point for everyone not named Henry. His blow-up on 18 restored natural order: even in triumph, failure beckons.

Mullin extended his Jacket lead to five strokes, the sort of margin that in professional golf suggests dominance but in TEG competition merely indicates temporary superiority in a field actively pursuing collapse. Williams somehow maintained his nine-point Trophy advantage despite posting the round's worst Stableford score, 36 points representing approximately three-quarters of his opening statement. The mathematics of disaster suggested that if he continued declining at this rate, Round 4 would produce negative numbers requiring theoretical physics to explain.

Baker and Neumann matched Williams's 36 points, creating a three-way tie for fourth place in a five-player field. The symmetry was almost beautiful.

## Round 3: The Collapse That Wasn't {.round3 .round}

El Prat's Rosa course, Greg Norman's tribute to championship golf, provided the setting for perhaps the tournament's defining moment: Mullin's final-hole quadruple blow-up that handed the Jacket lead to Baker whilst simultaneously demonstrating that five-stroke cushions are psychological constructs rather than mathematical certainties. The course had hosted Spanish Opens. Today it hosted something else entirely.

The early holes passed in relative calm, which in TEG terms means only minor disasters rather than civilisation-ending ones. Then came seven and eight, consecutive par fours that collectively produced five blow-ups across the field. Meller's sextuple on eight suggested he'd brought experimental scoring methods from another sport entirely. Baker matched with a quintuple. Williams added a quadruple for symmetry. The holes functioned as a kind of mass-casualty event with scorecards.

Mullin appeared comfortable through fifteen holes, the sort of dangerous comfort that precedes Greek-tragedy-level reversals. His blow-up on 15 initiated the unraveling. Another on 16 confirmed it. Then came 18, a par five requiring only that one avoid hitting nine shots, which Mullin failed to do. Baker's par gave him a one-stroke Jacket lead whilst Mullin contemplated life choices that had led to this specific moment on this specific hole in this specific country.

Williams dropped to 33 points but somehow extended his Trophy lead, less through excellence than through everyone else's equal commitment to mediocrity. His seven-point margin suggested either dominance or the field's collective acceptance that he'd earned this through sheer determination to suffer more entertainingly than anyone else.

Neumann won the round with 36 points, which previously would have been considered a disappointing performance but in this context represented triumph.

## Round 4: Disaster as Methodology {.round4 .round}

PGA Catalunya's Stadium course, Spain's finest layout and a regular European Tour venue, witnessed Williams's final round masterpiece of sustained catastrophe. Twenty-eight points. Eight blow-ups. A front nine so comprehensively disastrous that Tour professionals in the clubhouse briefly wondered if the handicap system required philosophical revision. His 41-over gross represented not just a bad round but a new epistemological category of performance.

Williams's triple on three initiated proceedings. Another on four confirmed the day's trajectory. By the sixth, he'd posted his third blow-up in four holes, the mathematical precision suggesting intentionality. The seventh hole, a par five offering multiple opportunities for recovery, instead delivered a quadruple that cost him the Trophy lead for the first time in 79 holes. Baker, briefly ascending to first place, must have experienced that peculiar vertigo that accompanies unexpected elevation.

Then came nine, where chaos achieved its purest expression. Baker posted a sextuple, six over par on a par four, the sort of score that requires genuine creativity in failure. Mullin's par took him into the Jacket lead. Williams added a triple because at this point, why not? By the tenth, Williams had somehow regained the Trophy lead through Baker's generous self-destruction, proving that in TEG competition, victory belongs not to the excellent but to whoever collapses least spectacularly in the final analysis.

Williams's four-point score on 12 represented his round's high point, a relative term given the surrounding wreckage. Baker reclaimed the Jacket lead on 16, lost it again on 17. Mullin's closing blow-up on 15 kept everyone mathematically engaged whilst simultaneously suggesting he'd rather not win under these conditions. Williams finished with his eighth blow-up on 18, a triple that somehow didn't matter because Baker had posted a quadruple.

Final margins: three points in Trophy, four strokes in Jacket. Williams had survived his own catastrophic excellence through everyone else's equal commitment to the cause of competitive self-harm.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Williams's second Trophy arrived through methods that defied every known principle of tournament golf: lead from start to finish whilst posting 21 blow-ups, including eight in a closing round that would have cost anyone else the championship. His 20-point Stableford swing from Round 1 to Round 4 represented not just volatility but a kind of performance art exploring the boundaries between competence and chaos. That he prevailed by three points over Baker, who himself posted nine blow-ups, suggested less a victory than a mutual exhaustion pact where Williams simply collapsed last.

Mullin's fourth Green Jacket established him as the competition's most decorated gross champion despite finishing fourth in Stableford, proving once again that the two competitions inhabit parallel universes with occasionally overlapping geography. His ability to dominate whilst simultaneously struggling demonstrated golf's essential paradox: one can be both excellent and terrible, often within the same round.

Baker's runner-up finishes in both competitions represented the tournament's cruelest subplot, coming within touching distance of history whilst also demonstrating precisely why history remained untouched. His six-over quintuple on Round 4's ninth, immediately after taking the Trophy lead, functioned as a kind of cosmic joke about ambition meeting reality at high speed.

The 53 blow-ups across four rounds established a new tournament record that probably shouldn't be celebrated but demands acknowledgment nonetheless. Catalonia had witnessed something unprecedented: wire-to-wire dominance achieved through spectacular incompetence, championship golf played at a level that made mediocrity look like aspiration rather than insult.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Blow-Up Distribution:**
Williams led the carnage with 21 triple-bogeys or worse, which averaged to 5.25 per round, which approaches performance consistency through sheer repetition of disaster. Meller contributed 15, Baker 9, Neumann 8, Mullin 7. That the Jacket winner posted fewest blow-ups suggests some correlation between avoiding catastrophe and winning gross competitions, though further research is required.

**Volatility Index:**
Williams's 20-point Stableford range (48 to 28) and 21-stroke gross range (+20 to +41) established new standards for inconsistency. His final round 41-over represented the worst closing performance by a Trophy winner, beating his own body of work in this specific category.

**Par-Three Excellence:**
Williams posted two of his three tournament birdies on par threes (R1: H11, H14), suggesting his game performs best when required to think least. The correlation between hole length and success rate deserves academic study or at least sympathetic acknowledgment.

**Lead Changes:**
Round 4 featured multiple lead changes in both competitions, with Williams losing the Trophy lead on H7, regaining it on H10, whilst Baker took and lost the Jacket lead twice in the final three holes. The chaos suggested less sport than performance art exploring themes of ambition, hubris, and golf's essential meaninglessness.

**Front Nine/Back Nine Splits:**
Williams posted a combined -21 differential favouring back nines across four rounds, suggesting either superior concentration in closing holes or fortunate timing of collapses. Baker showed similar patterns (-18 differential), whilst Mullin's +5 front-nine preference indicated morning-person tendencies or declining afternoon concentration.

**The Meller Paradox:**
Henry's Round 2 performance (41 points, +17) represented both the tournament's best Stableford round and confirmed his Wooden Spoon status, proving that in golf, as in Greek tragedy, one's moment of glory often illuminates the depth of one's general situation.
