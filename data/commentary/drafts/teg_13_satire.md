# TEG 13: Jon Baker's Perfect 72 and David Mullin's Fall from Grace {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 13 | Kent | 2020</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Some sporting contests unfold as narrative thrillers. Others reveal themselves as prolonged, inevitable mathematical exercises in humiliation. TEG 13 belonged firmly to the latter category. Jon Baker led every single hole of seventy-two, in both Stableford and Gross competitions simultaneously, a feat of such comprehensive dominance that one suspects the other four participants might have been better served staying in bed. He won by six points and eighteen strokes respectively. The venues were spectacular: Royal Cinque Ports, Prince's, and Littlestone, three Kent links courses where the wind performs acts of casual violence upon golf balls.

The supporting cast provided their own tragicomic subplots. Gregg Williams mounted a spirited pursuit that peaked at precisely one hole of shared leadership before reality reasserted itself. John Patterson produced the tournament's most volatility, featuring an eagle immediately followed by a blow-up, a forty-nine-point round immediately preceded by a twenty-eight-point round, and finishing joint third despite playing like a man whose internal GPS had been systematically corrupted. Most poignantly, David Mullin descended from eight-time Green Jacket champion to Wooden Spoon recipient, sealed by a ninth-hole disaster that read like a ransom note written by someone who'd lost count.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (Winner, Trophy & Jacket):** Swept both competitions with the emotional range of a metronome, never once relinquishing either lead. Led all seventy-two holes. His consistency bordered on the sociopathic: an eight-point round range across four days. Victory margins of six points and eighteen strokes respectively. This was dominance as administrative process.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd, Trophy & Jacket):** Briefly held the Trophy lead for exactly one hole in Round 2 before reality intervened. Finished eighteen strokes behind in the Jacket despite producing the tournament's best single round. One imagines him arriving home, partner asking how it went, Williams staring into the middle distance muttering "I led for one hole."

**Alex BAKER (Joint 3rd, Trophy):** Mounted no serious challenge whatsoever, yet somehow finished joint third through the simple expedient of not completely falling apart. His best round came on the final day when the tournament had already assumed room temperature. Produced his first-ever seventeen-gross hole, which in context felt like celebrating a parking ticket.

**John PATTERSON (Joint 3rd, Trophy):** The tournament's designated chaos agent. Recorded both an eagle and three blow-ups in Round 4 alone. His twenty-one-point round swing and fourteen total blow-ups suggested a man playing golf whilst simultaneously receiving troubling news via earpiece. Finished joint third despite gross scores that occasionally resembled telephone numbers.

**David MULLIN (Wooden Spoon):** Eight-time Green Jacket winner reduced to Spoon recipient via a ninth-hole disaster in Round 4 that will haunt Kent for generations. The H10 scorecard entry read nine-slash-plus-five. That's not golf. That's a cry for help written in numbers.

## Round 1: The Immediate Establishment of Hierarchy {.round1 .round}

Royal Cinque Ports revealed itself as advertised: a championship links that hosted two Open Championships and possessed the moral flexibility to destroy amateur golfers without remorse. The first hole saw Baker and Williams share both Trophy and Jacket leads at three points and level par respectively, a brief moment of democratic equality that lasted approximately four hundred yards. Links golf operates on principles of Old Testament justice.

By the third hole, Jon Baker had birdied whilst Williams recorded his second consecutive blow-up. The separation was complete. Baker's front nine produced twenty-three Stableford points, establishing a comfortable six-point Trophy lead and nine-stroke Jacket advantage. Williams attempted recovery on the back nine with twenty-one points including a birdie at the fifteenth, but the mathematics had already assumed their final shape. Patterson experienced a round that foreshadowed his tournament: three blow-ups scattered across eighteen holes like landmines deployed by a confused general.

Alex Baker endured consecutive blow-ups at eleven and twelve, the golfing equivalent of walking into the same glass door twice. Mullin played steadily for third place. The tone was set.

## Round 2: The Five-Minute Revolution {.round2 .round}

Prince's Dunes-Himalayas combination offered twenty-seven holes of authentic links torment distributed across three spectacular nines. The wind arrived like an unwelcome relative. Patterson opened with consecutive blow-ups, establishing early that today's performance would match yesterday's in terms of structural integrity. Williams produced the tournament's best round: forty-one points of relentless Stableford accumulation. By the fifteenth hole, he'd actually seized the Trophy lead. Democracy briefly flickered.

Jon Baker responded with the emotional affect of a man discovering his parking meter had expired. He birdied the eighteenth, reclaimed the lead, and proceeded as if the entire democratic experiment had been a minor administrative error requiring correction. His thirty-six points maintained a one-point Trophy advantage. The Jacket lead remained untouchable at sixteen gross. Williams had played brilliantly and gained precisely nothing in the Gross competition. The cruelty was elegant.

Patterson recorded six blow-ups and finished with twenty-eight points, a score suggesting either deliberate sabotage or complete cognitive meltdown. Alex Baker's thirty-four points kept him mathematically relevant whilst spiritually defeated. Mullin quietly accumulated thirty-seven points. The gap to Baker's lead had widened to one point in Trophy, comfortable distance in Jacket.

## Round 3: The Great Volatility Experiment {.round3 .round}

Littlestone, a classic remote links on Romney Marshes designed by Royal St George's architect and refined by Braid and MacKenzie, provided the theater for Patterson's cognitive resurrection. He produced forty-nine Stableford points, rocketing from fifth to joint third in Trophy standings via a performance that included a birdie, multiple four-point holes, and mercifully few acts of self-harm. One imagines his playing partners experiencing whiplash.

Baker responded with forty-four points and a birdie at the ninth, extending his Trophy lead to five points whilst maintaining complete Jacket control. Williams managed forty points but lost ground in both competitions despite playing objectively good golf. This is the essential tragedy of amateur tournament golf: you can improve dramatically and still lose comprehensively. Alex Baker and Mullin both recorded thirty-two points, sufficient to remain upright but insufficient to challenge.

The standings after fifty-four holes told a story of mathematical inevitability interrupted briefly by Patterson's manic episode. Baker led by five in Trophy, nineteen in Jacket. Williams trailed in both. Patterson had clawed back to joint third through sheer volatility. Mullin occupied fourth, unaware that his final round contained a ninth-hole disaster that would define his tournament legacy.

## Round 4: The Sealing of Fates {.round4 .round}

Prince's Shore-Dunes combination, considered the strongest routing available, witnessed the tournament's conclusion and Mullin's descent into Spoon ignominy. Patterson opened with an eagle at the second hole, a magnificent piece of golf that lasted approximately four minutes before he recorded a blow-up at the third. This summarised his entire tournament: moments of genuine brilliance immediately followed by complete unraveling. He'd finish with thirty-six points and three blow-ups, bipolar excellence incarnate.

The tenth hole destroyed David Mullin utterly. A nine. Plus five. Zero points. The Wooden Spoon was his, sealed by a single hole of such comprehensive failure that one suspects the course itself felt embarrassed. Eight-time Green Jacket champion reduced to final-place finisher via eighteen holes of accumulating horror. Alex Baker, sensing opportunity, recorded four points at the same hole to escape Spoon territory. Professional survival instincts.

Jon Baker closed with thirty-nine points including a birdie at the seventeenth, maintaining both leads comfortably. His gross score set a new course record at Prince's Shore-Dunes. Gregg Williams finished second in both competitions despite producing thirty-eight points. The margins were decisive: six points Trophy, eighteen strokes Jacket. Baker had led all seventy-two holes. Never trailed. Never faltered.

The final scorecards revealed a tournament of stark contrasts: Baker's metronomic consistency versus Patterson's twenty-one-point round swings, Williams's relentless pursuit meeting immovable dominance, Mullin's fall from champion to Spoon. Some contests are decided by skill. Some by consistency. This one was decided on the first hole and simply took seventy-one more to formalise the paperwork.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

TEG 13 will be remembered not for competitive drama but for administrative thoroughness. Jon Baker led every single hole across seventy-two, in both competitions simultaneously, a statistical anomaly suggesting either supreme skill or deeply flawed tournament design. His third Trophy and third Green Jacket arrived via margins that rendered the final two rounds essentially ceremonial. Six-point Trophy victory. Eighteen-stroke Jacket win. Complete control from first tee to eighteenth green.

The supporting narratives provided their own savage entertainment. Williams mounted what technically qualified as a challenge, briefly seizing the Trophy lead for one glorious hole before mathematics reasserted hierarchy. He finished second in both competitions having played genuinely excellent golf that simply encountered an immovable object. Patterson's volatility produced the tournament's most memorable statistical spread: a forty-nine-point round, an eagle-to-blow-up combo in consecutive holes, fourteen total blow-ups, and a twenty-one-point round range that suggested someone playing three different sports simultaneously. He finished joint third despite gross scores occasionally entering telephone-number territory.

Most poignantly, David Mullin's tournament arc traced a hero's journey in reverse. Eight-time Green Jacket champion arriving in Kent with legitimate credentials, departing with the Wooden Spoon after a tenth-hole disaster that will echo through amateur golf folklore. The scorecard entry read nine-slash-plus-five. That's not golf. That's numerical violence. Alex Baker survived to joint third through the simple expedient of not completely imploding, his best round arriving when the tournament had already flatlined.

The Kent links provided spectacular theatre for this exercise in competitive futility. Royal Cinque Ports, Prince's dual configurations, and Littlestone offered proper championship tests that exposed every technical flaw and psychological weakness. The courses were magnificent. The golf ranged from dominant to catastrophic. Some tournaments produce thrilling narratives of comeback and drama. Others reveal themselves as prolonged demonstrations of mathematical inevitability punctuated by isolated moments of chaos. TEG 13 belonged firmly to the latter category, and we're arguably richer for having witnessed it.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Consistency Analysis:**
Jon Baker's dominance derived partly from supernatural consistency: standard deviation of 3.32 in gross scores, producing an eight-point Stableford range across four rounds. Meanwhile, Patterson's 10.72 gross standard deviation suggested someone playing entirely different sports on alternate days. The contrast between metronomic excellence and beautiful chaos defined the tournament's character.

**The Blow-up Paradox:**
Patterson accumulated fourteen blow-ups across seventy-two holes yet finished joint third in Trophy standings, proof that occasional excellence can overcome systematic disaster. Baker recorded six blow-ups but maintained leads throughout. Williams suffered six blow-ups and finished second in both competitions. The moral: consistency in mediocrity defeats volatility in almost-competence.

**The Fifty-Six-Stroke Chasm:**
Final gross scores ranged from Baker's plus-fifty to Patterson's plus-one-hundred-six, a fifty-six-stroke spread suggesting five entirely different tournaments occurred simultaneously. This wasn't competition. This was five parallel universes occasionally intersecting at tee boxes and greens.

**The One-Hole Democracy:**
Williams held the Trophy lead for exactly one hole across seventy-two. Democracy lasted approximately fifteen minutes before autocracy reasserted itself. One imagines historians studying this brief flickering of hope before inevitable extinguishment.

**The Mullin Tragedy:**
An eight-time Green Jacket champion claiming the Wooden Spoon represents either profound regression or statistical inevitability finally asserting itself. His H10 disaster in Round 4 sealed the fate: nine strokes, plus-five, zero points. That's not golf. That's a crime scene requiring investigation.
