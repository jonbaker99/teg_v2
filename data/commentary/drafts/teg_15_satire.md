# TEG 15: Gregg Williams Wins Both Trophies, The Weekend Nobody Else Showed Up {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 15 | Lisbon Coast | 2022</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Some victories unfold as narratives. This one unfolded as a four-round PowerPoint presentation titled "Gregg Williams Is Rather Good At Golf And You Lot Demonstrably Are Not." Williams seized both leads by hole four of round one and spent the subsequent seventy-one holes extending his advantage with the grim inevitability of entropy. By the final green, he'd accumulated his fourth Trophy and maiden Green Jacket with a twenty-one-point margin that suggested less a competition than a sponsored charity event where the sponsor forgot to turn up.

The tournament's secondary plot concerned who would finish least catastrophically behind him. Stuart Neumann surged to second place despite recording a quintuple bogey on the final hole, which tells you everything about the carnage unfolding in Williams's wake. Hole eighteen produced five disasters from six players, as if the golf gods had decided to stage a commemorative fireworks display to mark the end of amateur ambition. The field collectively recorded sixty-one blow-ups across four rounds. Williams had eight.

The venue was Portugal's Lisbon Coast, returning after a six-tournament absence. Four courses. Three new to TEG's records. Conditions varied from Estoril's tree-lined parkland charm to Oitavos Dunes's wind-battered Atlantic exposure, which by Sunday resembled less a golf course than a psychological endurance test conducted by sadists with clipboards.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Gregg Williams (Winner, Both Competitions):** Led all seventy-two holes of Trophy competition and sixty-four of seventy-two in Green Jacket reckoning. Five birdies. Twenty-eight pars. Eight disasters spread across four rounds like tasteful seasoning. Completed the career sweep with his first Jacket to accompany three previous Trophies. Played golf as if following instructions from a manual titled "How Not To Be Terrible." The rest of us were clearly using different manuals, possibly written in languages we couldn't read.

**Stuart Neumann (2nd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Posted a brilliant forty-three points in round three, then celebrated by recording a nine on the final hole. Finished twenty-one points back despite this mathematical self-sabotage, which speaks either to his sustained excellence or everyone else's sustained mediocrity. Recorded no birdies across seventy-two holes, suggesting a philosophical commitment to par that bordered on religious devotion. His round-four front nine tallied twenty-one points before the back nine reminded him that hope is a cognitive error.

**John Patterson (3rd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Briefly held the Trophy lead at round two's third hole before collapsing like a man who'd just remembered he'd left the oven on at home. Bookended the tournament with disasters: an eight on round one's first hole, a ten on round four's opener. Between these literary brackets, occasionally played decent golf. Finished third despite gross scores that suggested someone filling in a tax return while drunk.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Led both competitions after hole one, then recorded six blow-ups in seven holes spanning round one's eleventh through seventeenth. This constitutes what psychologists call "a complete cognitive unraveling." Finished second in Green Jacket standings despite thirteen zero-point holes, which is rather like winning the bronze medal in a race where you spent most of the time running the wrong direction. His round two featured a seventeen that appeared on the scorecard like a ransom demand.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Struck an eagle on round two's fifteenth, which was lovely. Also recorded twelve disasters, which was less lovely. His round four featured blow-ups on both the first hole and the eighteenth, bracketing the round like satirical punctuation marks. Posted a personal-worst thirty-three over par on the final day, suggesting he'd achieved some form of anti-enlightenment where understanding golf made him worse at it.

**Alex Baker (6th, Both Competitions, Spoon):** Thirteen zero-point holes. Plus one hundred and thirty-four gross. A third career Wooden Spoon, which at least demonstrates consistency in an otherwise chaotic universe. Recorded a ten on round three's fourteenth hole that appeared to break something fundamental in his relationship with the sport. Occasionally struck decent shots, presumably by accident. Avoided being mentioned in any hot-spell statistics, which is perhaps the kindest thing one can say.

## Round 1: The Theatre Of Operations Commences {.round1 .round}

Estoril Golf Club presented itself as a charming parkland examination, the sort of course where accuracy matters more than distance and course management matters more than both. By the third hole, it had become a clinical study in who could manage not to hit eight. The answer, it turned out, was mostly Gregg Williams.

Jon Baker opened with a four on the first to claim both leads simultaneously, which must have felt rather nice for approximately twelve minutes. Williams responded to his own opening-hole eight with a birdie on the third and another on the fourth, seizing both leads by the time most players were still processing their opening disasters. Stuart Neumann recorded an eight and a nine on his first three holes, suggesting he'd arrived at the course under the impression it was crazy golf.

Baker's front nine promised much. Twenty-one points. Then came holes ten through seventeen, which resembled less a stretch of golf than a humanitarian crisis conducted in slow motion. Six blow-ups in seven holes. Nines on the eleventh and twelfth. Another seven. Another eight. By the seventeenth, his scorecard read like a failed attempt at sudoku. Williams, meanwhile, cruised to thirty-nine points with the serene confidence of a man who'd discovered the secret to golf was simply not being catastrophically bad at it.

Patterson rallied on the back nine to claim second place, eleven points adrift. Baker finished third despite his collapse, which tells you everything about everyone else's front nine. Williams led by five points and eight strokes. The mathematical inevitability had begun.

## Round 2: The Widening Aperture {.round2 .round}

West Cliffs Golf Links arrived with its world-class credentials and immediately set about destroying any remaining illusions of competence. Cynthia Dye's links design earned World's Best New Course in 2017. By the sixth hole, most players wished it hadn't been invented at all.

Patterson struck a birdie on the third to briefly claim the Trophy lead, which lasted precisely one hole. Williams reclaimed it on the fourth and spent the remainder of the round extending his advantage with the grim efficiency of a bailiff serving eviction notices. The sixth hole produced a massacre: four disasters, including an eleven from Alex Baker that suggested he'd stopped counting halfway through. Jon Baker added an eight and a nine on consecutive holes, which is commitment to a theme if nothing else.

The lowlight belonged to Baker's seventeenth hole seventeen, which appeared on the scorecard like a typographical error that turned out to be true. Williams, by contrast, recorded forty points despite a ten on the fifteenth that he probably found mildly irritating. Mullin struck an eagle on that same fifteenth. One point of light in a round that otherwise resembled a documentary about industrial decline.

Williams led by nine points after thirty-six holes. Patterson sat second, twenty-five strokes over par but somehow only nine points back in Trophy terms, which tells you something about the carnage. Baker and Alex Baker had recorded six zero-point holes each. The tournament had evolved from competition to survival exercise.

## Round 3: The Penha Longa Reckoning {.round3 .round}

Robert Trent Jones Jr's Atlantic Course at Penha Longa occupies the Sintra hills like a mathematical proof that golf courses can be too beautiful to be fair. Mountain parkland terrain. Coastal views. Slopes that suggested the designer had confused "challenging" with "vindictive." Williams posted forty-four points and plus ten gross, which on this layout constituted something approaching sorcery.

He struck birdies on the eighth, tenth, and fifteenth whilst everyone else struggled with basic arithmetic. Patterson managed twenty points on the front nine before recording disasters on the tenth and sixteenth that felt personally targeted by the golf gods. Alex Baker's fourteenth-hole ten arrived like the punchline to a joke nobody wanted to hear. Neumann posted forty-three points with zero birdies, which is rather like winning a baking competition without using flour.

Jon Baker recovered to forty-one points. Mullin notched forty despite his earlier struggles. The narrative was becoming less "who can challenge Williams" and more "who can avoid finishing last." Williams's lead had stretched to eighteen points with one round remaining. Jacket standings showed similar dominance. The tournament had effectively ended. Sunday would merely provide the paperwork.

Patterson's back nine yielded just fifteen points. Alex Baker recorded three disasters in six holes through the middle stretch. The course record fell to Williams. His plus ten remained tied for the course standard by round's end, which felt appropriate. He was, after all, running the entire show by this point.

## Round 4: The Final Green Apocalypse {.round4 .round}

Oitavos Dunes. Portugal's premier golf course. Top one hundred worldwide. The Atlantic coast at its most brutally honest. Sunday brought conditions that suggested the wind had developed personal grudges against specific players.

Patterson opened with a ten. Mullin and Alex Baker struck eights. By the time most players reached the second tee, the tournament already felt like a war crimes tribunal. Williams posted thirty-four points despite a seven on the sixth, which by his standards constituted a minor administrative error. The real story was developing at the back of the pack, where various catastrophes were unfolding in real time.

Neumann's front nine tallied twenty-one points. Redemption appeared possible. Then came the eighteenth, where five of six players recorded disasters in what can only be described as a collective psychotic break. Neumann struck a nine. Baker an eight. Mullin another eight. Williams even managed a seven, though by that point he'd already won both competitions by margins suggesting different species competing. Alex Baker's seven was somehow the least damaging option.

The final standings showed Williams twenty-one points clear in Trophy reckoning, twenty-nine strokes ahead in Jacket terms. Neumann had surged from fifth overnight to claim second despite his closing quintuple bogey, which is rather like winning the silver medal whilst on fire. Mullin posted his personal-worst thirty-three over par, completing a final round that resembled a slow-motion car crash filmed from multiple angles for educational purposes.

Williams collected his fourth Trophy and first Green Jacket. The others collected their scorecards and presumably considered different hobbies. Sixty-one total disasters across seventy-two holes. The tournament had been decided by hole four of round one and everything since had been statistical inevitability dressed as sport.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Gregg Williams played seventy-two holes of golf and led for seventy-two holes of golf, which suggests either mastery or everyone else suffering from a collective virus that affected only their ability to play golf. His fourth Trophy and first Green Jacket arrived with wire-to-wire dominance that turned competition into mathematical demonstration. Eight disasters across four rounds. Five birdies. Twenty-eight pars. The rest of us recorded sixty-one disasters between us, which averages out to just over twelve each and suggests we were competing in a different sport entirely.

The margin was twenty-one points in Trophy reckoning, twenty-nine strokes in Jacket terms. Stuart Neumann claimed second despite a closing quintuple bogey that would have destroyed lesser campaigns. Jon Baker led both competitions after one hole before recording thirteen disasters that resembled a systematic deconstruction of hope. Patterson finished third despite gross scores that suggested active hostility toward par. Mullin struck one eagle and twelve disasters, which is balance of a sort.

The final hole produced five blow-ups from six players, as if the golf gods had decided to stage a commemorative disaster to mark the end of amateur ambition. Alex Baker collected his third career Wooden Spoon with thirteen zero-point holes and plus one hundred and thirty-four gross, which is consistency if nothing else.

Portugal's Lisbon Coast provided four courses ranging from charming parkland to wind-battered links. Oitavos Dunes lived up to its top-one-hundred ranking by destroying most players' will to continue. Williams set a course record at Penha Longa with plus ten, which remained the standard by tournament's end and felt appropriate. He'd spent four rounds demonstrating that golf is actually quite simple when you don't record disasters every three holes. The rest of us were clearly operating from different manuals, possibly written by people who'd never seen golf before and were working from rumours they'd overheard in pubs.

The trophy presentation presumably involved Williams collecting both prizes whilst everyone else wondered whether different hobbies might be more psychologically sustainable. Williams completed the career sweep. The rest of us completed our education in futility. Same time next year, presumably.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Disaster Distribution (Blow-ups Per Player):**
Williams led wire-to-wire despite recording eight disasters, which averaged two per round and constituted remarkable restraint compared to everyone else. Baker brothers combined for twenty-six blow-ups, which is practically a family business at that point. Mullin's twelve disasters included bookending round four with carnage on holes one and eighteen, suggesting a commitment to thematic consistency. Neumann's quintuple bogey finish marked his fifth zero-point hole of the tournament, though he still claimed second place, which tells you everything about everyone else's campaigns.

**Front Nine vs Back Nine Performance:**
Williams demonstrated marginal back-nine preference across the tournament, which is what happens when you're not constantly in crisis mode. Neumann and Baker both posted strong-starter patterns through multiple rounds before various collapses reminded them that back nines exist. Patterson's front-nine excellence in round three (twenty points) was immediately followed by a fifteen-point back nine that resembled someone forgetting how golf worked halfway through.

**The H18 Apocalypse:**
The final hole of the tournament produced five disasters from six players, which averaged out to plus four per player and suggested the golf gods had saved their best work for last. Neumann's nine and Patterson's earlier ten bookended the carnage. Williams's seven was practically conservative in context. Alex Baker's seven-and-one-point somehow constituted the least damaging outcome, which is balance of a particularly dark sort.

**Course Difficulty Rankings:**
West Cliffs (Round 2) produced the most collective disasters with eighteen blow-ups, suggesting Cynthia Dye's links design earned its World's Best New Course award by destroying amateur golfers' confidence. Oitavos Dunes claimed second with fifteen disasters despite being Portugal's premier layout. Estoril's parkland charm still managed thirteen disasters, proving that tree-lined accuracy tests are equally capable of inducing psychological collapse. Penha Longa's mountain terrain produced the fewest disasters (fifteen) but the most spectacular individual carnage, including Alex Baker's ten on the fourteenth that appeared to break something fundamental in his relationship with the sport.
