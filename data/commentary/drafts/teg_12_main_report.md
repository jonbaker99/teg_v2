## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

John Patterson claimed his second TEG Trophy at PGA Catalunya Resort, seizing control during Round 3's chaotic opening and cruising home by ten points with extraordinary consistency. Jon Baker secured his second Green Jacket through dominant wire-to-wire control, leading 58 of 72 holes and setting a course record 89 at the Stadium Course. The championship witnessed an unprecedented split: Patterson finished fourth in Gross while Baker placed fourth in Stableford, marking the only TEG where Trophy and Jacket winners occupied opposite halves of each competition.

Patterson's victory was built on metronomic reliability. His gross rounds varied by just two strokes across four days despite catastrophic blow-ups at crucial moments. The defining stretch came in Round 3's first ten holes, where sixteen lead changes erupted before Patterson established control. Baker's Gross dominance contrasted sharply with his modest Stableford performance, whilst David Mullin claimed his third Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in Gross, a paradoxical outcome that highlighted the tournament's divergent narratives.

Spain's premier golf course provided a dramatic stage for this split verdict.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at the Tour Course {.round1 .round}

Gregg Williams opened the defence of Catalunya with both competitions within reach. Jon Baker shared the Gross lead on twelve over. The Tour Course presented familiar challenges, having hosted back-to-back TEG visits. Warm Mediterranean air hung over the parkland as play commenced.

Baker seized the early Trophy advantage at the first, posting four points. His brother Alex promptly blew up at the same hole. Patterson found immediate trouble at the second with a triple bogey. Then came the defining moment of his opening round: a massive twelve at the fourth that obliterated eight shots to par. The damage seemed catastrophic. Patterson refused to collapse.

A remarkable recovery began at the eighth. Patterson rattled off four-point returns across three consecutive holes. He climbed from the depths to take the Trophy lead at the eleventh. Williams meanwhile crafted a steady performance, briefly holding the Jacket lead before securing it at the eighteenth. Baker punctuated his round with birdies at the third and fourteenth.

Stuart Neumann endured a torrid afternoon. Blow-ups at the fifth, thirteenth, and fifteenth left him thirteen shots adrift of his pre-round hopes. Alex Baker's struggles mirrored those difficulties, massive blow-ups at the first, tenth, and thirteenth compounding his misery. Williams stood alone atop both leaderboards, one point clear in the Trophy race.

## Round 2: Williams Holds as Patterson Closes {.round2 .round}

Williams carried both leads onto the Tour Course for Round 2. Patterson lurked one point behind in the Trophy race. Baker remained tied for the Jacket lead, level with Williams on twelve over. The Catalan sun beat down as the field regrouped.

Williams suffered an early setback, blowing up at the fourth to surrender the Jacket lead. Patterson capitalised instantly, moving ahead in the Trophy standings. The lead proved temporary. Williams produced a birdie at the tenth to reclaim the Jacket advantage, matching Alex Baker's four-pointer at the same hole. Baker's own round featured wild swings, a strong back nine surge delivering twenty-three points after managing just fourteen on the front.

David Mullin posted the day's best Gross return. His twelve-over matched the course record set in Round 1. Three consecutive pars from the fifth through seventh anchored steady progress. Patterson's round unravelled at the fifteenth, where a catastrophic ten cost him five shots and the Trophy lead. Williams regained top spot.

Jon Baker birdied the eleventh but managed only thirty-six points overall. Neumann found form with nineteen points across six holes mid-round, a birdie at the sixth sparking the surge. Williams held both competitions after thirty-six holes, maintaining his slender one-point Trophy advantage. Patterson remained within striking distance.

## Round 3: Sixteen Changes, One Victor {.round3 .round}

The Stadium Course hosted Round 3 with Williams protecting twin leads. The Championship layout's demands would prove decisive. PGA Catalunya's premier test awaited the field.

Chaos erupted immediately. Patterson took the Trophy lead at the first. Williams regained it at the second, simultaneously claiming the Jacket advantage. Then the implosions began. Patterson blew up at the third with a ten, losing his advantage. Williams suffered a catastrophic nine at the fourth, haemorrhaging five shots and relinquishing both leads within two holes. Baker grabbed the Jacket. Patterson reclaimed the Trophy.

The carnage continued through the opening stretch. Sixteen lead changes materialised across the first ten holes, a frenzied sequence of blow-ups and recoveries. Alex Baker posted zeroes at both the second and fourth. Stuart Neumann joined the disaster parade with blow-ups at the second and fourth. Patterson weathered another meltdown at the seventh, posting nine for a four-over return.

Williams collapsed spectacularly from the eleventh. Back-to-back horror shows at the twelfth and thirteenth yielded ten shots to par combined. His Trophy challenge disintegrated. Patterson steadied himself brilliantly. A nineteen-point haul from the twelfth through seventeenth, including a birdie at the fifteenth, established an eight-point cushion. Baker maintained his Jacket lead despite modest Stableford returns.

## Round 4: Patterson Extends, Baker Sets Record {.round4 .round}

Patterson carried an eight-point Trophy advantage onto the Stadium Course for the finale. Baker led the Jacket race by five strokes. Both men faced different challenges in securing their respective crowns. World-class demands awaited at Spain's premier layout.

Patterson opened with a triple bogey. The stumble barely registered. His lead absorbed the blow. He compiled forty points through unspectacular but relentless accumulation. Neumann matched that total, punctuating his effort with the tournament's only eagle at the fifteenth, a five-point gem. Alex Baker also reached forty, his four-pointer at the fifth helping the cause.

Baker cruised to Jacket glory with seventeen-over par, setting a Stadium Course record 89 in the process. A birdie at the eighth offset a triple at the ninth. Consistent play secured an eight-stroke margin. Patterson's twenty-five over kept him fourth in Gross whilst delivering Trophy triumph.

Mullin endured a roller-coaster afternoon. Blow-ups at the third and fourth yielded just six points across holes two through seven. Then came redemption: eleven points from the twelfth through fourteenth, including birdies at the twelfth and fourteenth. The surge elevated him to second in Gross. It couldn't prevent Spoon confirmation.

Williams posted thirty-eight points to secure second place in the Trophy race. Neumann's eagle highlighted strong back-nine scoring across the field. Patterson's ten-point cushion never looked threatened. His consistency had conquered four days of chaos.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

John Patterson's second Trophy victory was forged through extraordinary consistency despite multiple disasters. His gross rounds ranged just twenty-three to twenty-five across four days, a metronomic performance that absorbed catastrophic blow-ups at the fourth in Round 1, the fifteenth in Round 2, and the third and seventh in Round 3. The total damage: twenty-two shots across five horror holes. His response defined the championship. Nineteen-point surges and steady accumulation elsewhere built an insurmountable advantage.

Round 3 provided the tournament's pivotal stretch. Sixteen lead changes erupted across the opening ten holes as Patterson, Williams, and Baker traded disasters and recoveries. Patterson emerged from the chaos with control, never relinquishing his grip despite opening the finale with a triple bogey. His 172-point total represented victory by ten points over Williams, who collapsed from dual leads after Round 2 with back-to-back Stadium Course blow-ups.

Jon Baker's second Green Jacket arrived through dominant wire-to-wire control. He led 58 of 72 holes, establishing an eight-stroke margin despite managing just 145 points in the Stableford competition. His course-record 89 at the Stadium in Round 4 capped sustained Gross excellence. The split verdict highlighted TEG's dual nature: Patterson finished fourth in Gross whilst Baker placed fourth in Stableford, marking unprecedented divergence.

David Mullin claimed his third Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in Gross, four points behind Alex Baker for fifth in Stableford. His seventy-one over represented strong scoring by Gross standards but failed to generate sufficient Stableford returns. Stuart Neumann's eagle at the fifteenth in Round 4 punctuated third place, whilst the Baker brothers occupied fourth and fifth in the Trophy race. Patterson's victory proved that relentless consistency trumps spectacular inconsistency, even when disaster strikes repeatedly.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

John Patterson's gross standard deviation of 0.82 across four rounds ranked as the steadiest performance in TEG 12, remarkable given his twenty-two-shot blow-up total. His consistency allowed absorption of disasters that would have destroyed conventional challenges.

Gregg Williams equalled his career-best 84 at the Tour Course in Round 1, becoming the fourth player to reach that mark at the venue. His ten-shot collapse across two holes in Round 3 represented the tournament's most concentrated disaster zone.

Stuart Neumann's eagle at the fifteenth in Round 4 was the tournament's sole two-under return, a rare occurrence by TEG standards. His six Stableford zeroes matched Patterson's total, highlighting the fine margins between third and first.

David Mullin posted the second-lowest Gross total at seventy-one over whilst finishing last in Stableford, a twenty-three-point gap to fifth place illustrating the competitions' divergent demands. His back-nine surge in Round 4 delivered twenty-one points, insufficient to escape Spoon confirmation.

The split verdict marked TEG history. Patterson's fourth-place Gross and Baker's fourth-place Stableford represented the only occasion where Trophy and Jacket winners occupied opposite halves of both competitions, underlining the championship's capacity for divergent narratives within unified competition.
