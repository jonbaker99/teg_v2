## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

John Patterson claimed his second Trophy with a ten-point margin over Gregg Williams, seizing control after Williams suffered a catastrophic Round 3 collapse. Jon Baker's wire-to-wire Green Jacket victory proved equally emphatic, an eight-stroke margin over David Mullin securing his second title. The tournament returned to PGA Catalunya's championship courses, where Spain's premier layout once again tested the field across four demanding rounds.

Patterson's triumph came built on relentless consistency: four rounds between 40 and 45 points, never once dipping below par. Williams led for 33 of the first 36 holes before his title defence ended at the par-four 13th, where an 11 shattered his challenge. Mullin's tournament embodied contradiction. He tied the Tour course record. Finished runner-up in the Jacket. Yet claimed the wooden spoon.

Baker's Gross dominance never wavered. His 63-over total ranks third-best in TEG history, a performance built on control rather than flash. Round 1 featured 21 Trophy lead changes before the field settled into a two-man race that ultimately became Patterson's coronation.

## Round 1: Tour Course Turbulence {.round1 .round}

The PGA Catalunya Tour course welcomed the field back with its familiar parkland challenge. Patterson and Williams shared an early lead, but 21 Trophy lead changes through 18 holes suggested chaos rather than control. The first nine holes alone saw the Trophy pass between four different players.

Patterson opened with a four-pointer at the first, then immediately surrendered both leads with a six at the par-three second. David Mullin grabbed control briefly before Patterson's octuple bogey at the fourth. The damage was severe: twelve at a par-four. Williams profited from the carnage, moving ahead in the Jacket race. Jon Baker answered at the 14th with a birdie that reclaimed the Gross lead, yet Williams snatched it back four holes later with a par at the closing par-five.

Patterson rallied through the middle stretch, reeling off four-pointers at the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh. That surge rebuilt his challenge. Stuart Neumann endured a nightmare stretch from the 13th, posting a ten, then a twelve at the par-five 15th. Alex Baker's front nine featured horror show golf: a seven at the first, another seven at the second. By the 11th he clawed back into contention.

The leaderboard tightened into evening. Williams edged Patterson by a single point. Jon and Gregg shared the Gross lead at twelve over. Mullin and Neumann lurked within striking distance.

## Round 2: Records and Resilience {.round2 .round}

Williams maintained his slender Trophy advantage through the second circuit of the Tour course. Patterson stalked within a point. Mullin produced the round of the tournament: 40 points and 84 strokes tied the course record. Jon Baker extended his Gross lead despite managing only 36 points, his lowest return of the week.

The early holes saw Williams surrender the Jacket lead at the fourth, an eight unravelling his momentum. Patterson moved ahead in the Trophy race. Baker regained the Gross advantage at the 11th with a birdie, Williams reclaiming it at the 18th to establish a three-way tie atop the overall leaderboard. The margins remained impossibly tight.

Neumann strung together a remarkable stretch from the fourth through the 11th, accumulating 19 points across eight holes. His birdie at the par-four sixth anchored a run of four-pointers. The consistency lifted him to 44 points, the round's best return. Patterson briefly stumbled with a quintuple bogey at the 15th, his second blow-up of the day. Ten at a par-five. The mistake cost him the Trophy lead.

Alex Baker fought through a miserable front nine, posting just 14 points, then rallied magnificently across the closing stretch with 23 on the back. His birdie at the tenth kickstarted the revival. Williams and Patterson headed into the weekend deadlocked atop the Trophy standings, while Baker's Gross lead had stretched to four strokes over Williams and Mullin.

## Round 3: Stadium Stage Collapse {.round3 .round}

The Stadium course delivered the tournament's decisive drama. Williams led for 33 of the opening 36 holes, but his defence disintegrated spectacularly across nine holes. Patterson seized control with 45 points, the week's best Stableford return, building an eight-point cushion. Jon Baker maintained his Gross advantage despite modest scoring.

The opening exchanges traded leads repeatedly. Williams lost the Jacket at the first with a double bogey, Patterson grabbing the Trophy with a bogey. By the fourth, both competitions had changed hands twice more. Patterson's quintuple bogey at the par-five third looked potentially fatal. Instead, Williams matched the implosion at the fourth with a nine. The symmetry was almost cruel.

Patterson's pivotal stretch arrived on the back nine. From the 12th through 17th he accumulated 19 points, including a birdie at the par-five 15th. Jon Baker contributed his own birdie at the 12th, widening his Gross margin. Williams faced mounting pressure. At the par-five 12th he posted an eight. Then came the 13th.

The par-four played 410 yards. Williams took eleven. Seven over par. The number told its own story. His Trophy challenge ended there. Patterson's lead swelled to eight points with 18 holes remaining.

## Round 4: Coronations Confirmed {.round4 .round}

Patterson cruised home with 40 points, extending his Trophy margin to ten over Williams. Baker matched the 40-point mark while posting the week's best Gross round of 89 to complete his wire-to-wire Jacket triumph. The final day at the Stadium course belonged to the leaders, though Mullin's late surge and Neumann's eagle provided memorable footnotes.

Patterson opened with a triple bogey, then steadied immediately. His four-pointer at the par-three fifth settled any nerves. Williams managed a birdie at the par-five seventh but never seriously threatened. The gap proved too vast. Alex Baker joined Patterson and Neumann on 40 points for the round's joint-best return.

Neumann delivered the tournament's only eagle, a spectacular three at the par-five 15th worth five points. The moment briefly lifted him into contention for third place overall. Mullin endured a wretched start: a nine at the par-five third, then an eight at the fourth. He hit the bottom of the spoon standings. Yet he rallied brilliantly, birdies at the 12th and 14th highlighting a back-nine surge.

Baker's methodical excellence maintained his Gross advantage throughout the final 18. Not a single lead change disturbed the Jacket race. Patterson's consistency machine delivered one final 40-point performance. The margins reflected complete control. Williams finished second in both competitions, ten points back in the Trophy, twenty strokes behind in the Jacket.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Patterson's second Trophy arrived through unshakeable consistency rather than pyrotechnics. Four rounds between 40 and 45 points, never once falling below par over any 18-hole stretch. His 172-point total established a new tournament benchmark. The title looked uncertain through 36 holes, Williams maintaining his slender advantage. Then the Stadium course's back nine delivered its verdict. Williams' 11 at the 13th ended his 33-hole reign. Patterson seized the moment.

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire Jacket dominance proved equally emphatic. He led all 72 holes by the Gross measure, his 63-over performance ranking third-best in TEG history. The eight-stroke margin over Mullin reflected control rather than luck. Baker never wavered, his methodical excellence wearing down any challengers. Williams finished runner-up in both competitions, his Round 3 blow-up costing him a realistic shot at defending his Trophy.

Mullin's tournament defied logic. A course-record-tying 84 in Round 2. Second place in the Jacket race. Yet the wooden spoon claimed him for the third time in his career. His front-nine collapses proved too costly to overcome, even with late rallies that included birdies at the 12th and 14th in the final round. Neumann contributed the week's only eagle, a five-pointer at the par-five 15th that briefly elevated his standing.

The tournament began with 21 Trophy lead changes in Round 1, then settled into stability. Patterson's consistency outlasted Williams' drama. Baker's wire-to-wire mastery established new standards. And the Stadium course, Spain's finest layout, delivered its usual verdict: excellence rewarded, mistakes punished without mercy.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Jon Baker's 63-over Gross total ranks third-best in TEG history. His wire-to-wire Jacket victory marked only the second time a player led the Gross competition through all 72 holes without surrendering the advantage.

David Mullin's Round 2 score of 84 tied the PGA Catalunya Tour course record, matching performances by Jon Baker (TEG 11, Round 2; TEG 12, Round 1) and Gregg Williams (TEG 12, Round 1). Despite this achievement and finishing second in the Jacket race, Mullin claimed the wooden spoon for the third time, the largest points differential between a Jacket runner-up and spoon recipient in tournament history.

Round 1 featured 21 Trophy lead changes, the most volatile opening round in TEG history. By contrast, Rounds 2 through 4 produced zero lead changes in either competition once Williams and Baker established control after 18 holes.

Gregg Williams' 11 at the par-four 13th in Round 3 stands as the highest single-hole score of TEG 12, ending his 33-hole Trophy lead in spectacular fashion. The blow-up cost him seven strokes against par and yielded no Stableford points, a momentum shift from which he never recovered.

Three players — Patterson, Alex Baker, and Neumann — tied for the best single-round Stableford performance in Round 4 with 40 points each, demonstrating the competitive depth across the final 18 holes despite the settled leaderboard positions.
