# David Mullin Claims Third Trophy and Ninth Green Jacket in Historic Double

**Kent, England (2021)** – David Mullin swept both competitions at TEG 14, capturing his third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket across four classic Kent links. Playing Royal Cinque Ports, Littlestone, and Prince's Shore/Dunes, Mullin led wire-to-wire—but survived the tournament's narrowest margin in Trophy history.

Mullin won the Stableford Trophy by just two points over Alex Baker (154-152), holding off a ferocious final-round charge. Baker's tournament-best 43 points closed from nine points back, but Mullin's steady 37-point finish secured the double. Jon Baker claimed second in the Green Jacket, seven strokes behind (+75 to +68), despite finishing last in Stableford with 125 points and the Wooden Spoon.

Baker's contrasting fortunes defined TEG 14: he led the field with five birdies across the week yet couldn't escape catastrophic blow-ups that sank his Trophy campaign. Every player endured disaster—Alex Baker's sextuple-bogey 10 on Round 4's 16th hole nearly cost him second place, while Mullin avoided double digits despite six zero-point holes.
