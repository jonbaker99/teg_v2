## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams claimed his fourth TEG Trophy and maiden Green Jacket in dominant fashion, leading every round in both competitions to complete a career sweep. The 21-point margin (Trophy) and 29-stroke cushion (Jacket) reflected wire-to-wire control that was never seriously threatened after he seized both leads by the fourth hole of Round 1. Portugal's Lisbon Coast provided a spectacular backdrop, with the group tackling two new venues in Estoril and West Cliffs alongside returning favourites Penha Longa and Oitavos Dunes.

The tournament became a war of attrition. Sixty-one blow-ups scarred the field across 72 holes, with the final hole at Oitavos Dunes providing the most dramatic carnage: five of six players recorded disasters on the closing par four. Stuart Neumann's surge to second place came despite a quintuple bogey finish, whilst Jon Baker's early challenge collapsed spectacularly with six horror holes in seven attempts during Round 1. Williams's consistency proved the difference, recording just eight disasters all week whilst his rivals imploded.

## Round 1: Early Leader's Spectacular Collapse {.round1 .round}

Jon Baker opened with a par at Estoril's first hole to seize both Trophy and Jacket leads. Within three holes, he had lost them both. Gregg Williams birdied the third to take the Trophy lead, then birdied the par-three fourth to claim the Jacket lead. He would not relinquish either.

Baker's opening proved a false dawn. From the 11th hole onwards, his round disintegrated. He recorded blow-ups on the 11th, 12th, 15th and 17th. Eight over for those three holes. Nine at both the 11th and 12th. Ten points evaporated in seven holes. Williams watched the carnage unfold from the front.

Stuart Neumann began even worse than Baker finished. An eight at the first, matched by Williams. A nine at the third. Ten over for the opening three holes. Yet Neumann recovered to post 20 points on the back nine, salvaging fourth place overnight. Williams's two early birdies, combined with pars through the middle stretch, built a five-point Trophy cushion and an eight-stroke Jacket lead.

John Patterson's back-nine surge (22 points) lifted him to second place. David Mullin sat fifth despite three blow-ups. Alex Baker's four horror holes left him six points adrift.

## Round 2: H6 Apocalypse and Eagle Brilliance {.round2 .round}

West Cliffs Links presented the field with modern dunes and Atlantic winds. John Patterson briefly held the Trophy lead after birdieing the third. Gregg Williams had recorded a seven. Patterson held the advantage for one hole. Williams regained control at the fourth and extended his margin to nine points by round's end.

The sixth hole produced carnage. Alex Baker recorded an 11, six over par. David Mullin a 10. Stuart Neumann a 10. Patterson a nine. Five disasters on a single par five. Jon Baker added an eight. Only Williams emerged unscathed. Baker's misery continued at the seventh (a nine) and Alex Baker followed with another blow-up at the eighth.

Mullin provided the round's highlight on the 15th, rolling in an eagle putt. A rare feat by TEG standards. Yet even this brilliance was overshadowed by the continued struggles of Jon and Alex Baker, who each recorded six zero-point holes. The latter pair's combined 12 blobs left them deep in arrears. Williams's steady 40 points stretched his Trophy lead to nine and maintained his Jacket cushion.

Neumann's five disasters dropped him to last place. Patterson consolidated second. The battle lines were drawn.

## Round 3: Runaway Leader Extends Grip {.round3 .round}

Penha Longa's mountain parkland demanded precision. Williams delivered. His 44-point round (ten over gross) established a course record and stretched his Trophy lead to 18 points. Three birdies punctuated a performance of relentless control. The Jacket margin grew to 19 strokes. The tournament was effectively over.

Stuart Neumann posted an excellent 43 points, vaulting from sixth to fifth place. Yet Williams's brilliance made Neumann's effort look ordinary. Jon Baker recovered with 41 points, aided by a birdie at the 13th. David Mullin matched Baker's total with a birdie at the second. John Patterson's front nine (20 points) could not prevent a back-nine collapse. An eight at the tenth. A nine at the 16th.

Alex Baker endured another nightmare. A ten at the 14th, six over par. Blow-ups at the seventh, eighth and 12th. Twenty-nine points for the round. His third wooden spoon loomed large. Williams's steady pars through the middle stretch (holes six to 17 barely above par) demonstrated champion's golf whilst others imploded around him.

## Round 4: H18 Carnage Caps Dominant Victory {.round4 .round}

Oitavos Dunes, Portugal's premier links, provided a fitting stage for Williams's coronation. He posted 34 points (20 over gross) to extend his Trophy margin to 21 and his Jacket cushion to 29. The first TEG player to win both competitions in the same tournament. His rare mistakes, a seven at the sixth and another at the 18th, barely registered against a commanding performance.

John Patterson's nightmare start (a ten at the first, six over par) summed up the day's chaos. David Mullin followed with an eight. Alex Baker recorded an eight. Three disasters before most had found rhythm. Neumann recovered brilliantly, posting 21 points on the front nine. He seemed poised for a respectable finish.

Then came the 18th. Neumann recorded a nine, five over par. A quintuple bogey. Jon Baker followed with an eight. Mullin added an eight. Williams a seven. Alex Baker a seven. Five of six players recorded blow-ups on the closing hole. Only Patterson, already reeling from earlier disasters, avoided the carnage. Neumann's horror finish cost him dearly in the Jacket, yet his 36 points still lifted him from fifth to second in the Trophy. A Jekyll and Hyde performance epitomised a tournament of extremes.

Williams stood apart throughout. Consistent excellence defeated serial implosion. The career sweep was complete.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Gregg Williams produced a masterclass in Stableford golf. His 157 points broke clear of Stuart Neumann's 136 by 21, whilst his 29-stroke Jacket margin underlined total dominance. Five birdies and 28 pars across 72 holes kept disasters to a minimum. Eight blow-ups all week. His rivals averaged nearly double that figure.

Neumann's second place (Trophy) came despite zero birdies and a closing quintuple bogey, testament to others' struggles. John Patterson claimed third in the Trophy but faded badly in the Jacket after early promise. Jon Baker's 13 zero-point holes and early collapse from both leads left him fourth and second respectively. The latter result highlighted Gross scoring's different demands. David Mullin's lone eagle at West Cliffs provided brief brilliance, but 12 disasters undermined his challenge.

Alex Baker avoided a fourth wooden spoon by virtue of alphabetical ordering, matching David Mullin's total but losing the tiebreak. His 13 zero-point holes, including three consecutive blobs in Round 2 (holes six to eight), ensured last place in both competitions. The tournament's 61 total blow-ups reflected Portugal's courses' stern examination. Williams passed with distinction. His maiden Jacket, added to three previous Trophies, completed a career sweep few thought achievable after his opening eight at Estoril's first. He recovered. His rivals did not.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Gregg Williams (Winner, Trophy and Jacket):** Led all 72 holes in the Trophy and 64 of 72 in the Jacket, a performance of wire-to-wire excellence. Five birdies and just eight disasters across four rounds established a 21-point Trophy margin and 29-stroke Jacket cushion. Claimed his fourth Trophy and maiden Green Jacket to complete a career sweep.

**Stuart Neumann (2nd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Brilliant 43-point Round 3 vaulted him from sixth to second place, yet a closing quintuple bogey at Oitavos Dunes's 18th epitomised a wildly inconsistent week. Failed to register a single birdie across 72 holes. Twenty-one points behind Williams.

**John Patterson (3rd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Briefly held the Trophy lead in Round 2 before succumbing to repeated blow-ups. Strong back nine in Round 1 (22 points) could not prevent later collapses, including a ten at Round 4's opening hole.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Led both competitions after the first hole before recording six disasters in seven attempts (holes 11 to 17, Round 1). Thirteen zero-point holes across the week undermined recovery efforts. Second place in the Jacket offered scant consolation.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** TEG's only eagle, a spectacular strike at West Cliffs's 15th, provided the tournament's standout moment. Twelve blow-ups, including personal-worst scores in Round 4 (22 points, 33 over gross), left him mid-table.

**Alex Baker (6th both competitions):** Avoided a fourth wooden spoon by alphabetical tiebreak despite matching Mullin's totals. Thirteen zero-point holes, including a catastrophic ten at Penha Longa's 14th (Round 3), ensured last place in both standings. Three consecutive blobs in Round 2 (holes six to eight) summed up a nightmare week.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Gregg Williams became the first player to win both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket in the same tournament, leading every round in both competitions. His 157 points ranks as the second-highest Trophy total at the Lisbon Coast venues. Stuart Neumann's surge from fifth to second in Round 4, despite a quintuple bogey finish, marked the largest final-round climb in recent TEG history. The 61 total blow-ups across the field (an average of 10.2 per player) reflected the Lisbon Coast courses' unforgiving nature, with Oitavos Dunes's 18th hole alone producing five disasters in the final round. Jon Baker's six blow-ups in seven holes during Round 1 (holes 11 to 17) equalled the worst single-stretch collapse in TEG records.
