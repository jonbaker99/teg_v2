## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams became the first player in TEG history to capture both Trophy and Jacket in the same tournament, leading every single round by margins that grew from comfortable to crushing. The tour returned to the Lisbon Coast after a six-event absence, opening at new venue Estoril before finishing at the spectacular links of Oitavos Dunes. Williams never trailed across 72 holes, building a five-point lead in Round 1 that swelled to 21 by tournament's end.

Stuart Neumann authored the story within the story. Dead last after an opening-round disaster, he stormed back with Round 3's joint-best 43 points to claim runner-up. John Patterson's challenge collapsed on the opening hole of Round 4. Alex Baker collected his second career Wooden Spoon, enduring 13 zero-point holes across four brutal days.

The margins tell the tale: 21 points in the Trophy, 29 strokes in the Jacket. Williams set a Penha Longa course record in Round 3 and was never seriously threatened.

## Round 1: Early Dominance at Estoril {.round1 .round}

The tournament opened at Estoril Golf Club, Portugal's first course and a charming parkland test redesigned by Mackenzie Ross. Williams and Jon Baker shared the lead early. The defining moment came at the par-four third.

Williams birdied to seize both competitions. Baker promptly imploded at the 11th with a catastrophic nine. The 12th became a graveyard: Baker made another nine, Alex Baker an eight, Williams a seven. All failed to register a point. Williams recovered to birdie the par-three fourth, building separation. Patterson closed strongly with four points at the 16th, but the damage was done.

Neumann's round featured two nightmares. An eight at the first was followed by a nine at the third, dropping him to last. He added another blow-up at the 15th. His 31 points left him ten behind Williams.

Williams closed with 39 points and a 17-over 86, leading by five in the Trophy and eight strokes in the Jacket. Patterson sat second on 34 points. Baker's 31 points marked a front-nine collapse.

## Round 2: West Cliffs Extends the Lead {.round2 .round}

The field moved to West Cliffs, Cynthia Dye's award-winning links along the Silver Coast. Ocean views framed a day of widening gaps. Patterson briefly threatened with a birdie at the third, taking the Trophy lead for a single hole before Williams reclaimed it.

The par-five sixth became a house of horrors. Alex Baker made 11, David Mullin and Neumann both posted tens. Mullin later produced the round's highlight, an eagle at the 15th to salvage respectability. Jon Baker's struggles peaked at the 17th. An 11 there meant zero points.

Neumann endured consecutive disasters at the 13th and 14th, an 11 followed by a nine. He managed just 26 points. Alex Baker's front-nine meltdown left him with 27 points and last place in both competitions.

Williams navigated the carnage with 40 points and 16 over par, absorbing a ten at the 15th without serious damage. His lead grew to nine points and ten strokes. Patterson held second with 36 points. Jon Baker recovered on the back nine but sat fourth.

## Round 3: Course Record at Penha Longa {.round3 .round}

The tournament returned to Penha Longa's dramatic mountain parkland, last played at TEG 8. Steep terrain and coastal views awaited. Williams produced a masterclass, firing 44 points and ten over par to set a new course record.

He birdied the eighth, tenth, and 15th, never faltering. Jon Baker found a birdie at the 13th in an otherwise steady 41 points. Neumann matched Williams with 43 points, the joint-best round, vaulting from last to second place. His front nine featured 25 points. The back nine held.

Patterson's challenge unravelled. An eight at the tenth cost him zero points. A nine at the 16th deepened the wounds. He managed just 35 points, falling to fifth. Alex Baker's nightmare continued: blow-ups at the seventh, eighth, and 12th, then a catastrophic ten at the 14th. He scraped 29 points.

Williams led by 18 points and 23 strokes entering the final round. Neumann's recovery placed him second with 136 points. Baker and Mullin shared third on identical Gross scores.

## Round 4: Coronation at Oitavos Dunes {.round4 .round}

The finale unfolded at Oitavos Dunes, Portugal's premier links and the country's top-ranked course. Atlantic winds whipped across natural dunes. Williams needed only to avoid disaster. He managed 34 points and 20 over par, cruising home.

Patterson's hopes died at the opening hole. A ten there, a quintuple-bogey or worse, dropped him from second to third in the Trophy standings. He never recovered. Mullin suffered his own opening-hole collapse, an eight followed by another at the second. His 22 points marked a personal worst.

Neumann pieced together a strong front nine with 21 points, including four-point hauls at the fifth and 17th. Then came the 18th. A quintuple-bogey or worse for zero points ended his round on a sour note. Jon Baker also found grief at the last, making an eight.

The 18th claimed four victims. Williams closed with a seven but the Trophy and Jacket were long since secured. Neumann's 36 points held second place. Patterson's 30 points salvaged third despite the opening-hole nightmare.

Williams finished with 157 points and 63 over par, winning by 21 and 29 respectively. Never trailed, never threatened.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Gregg Williams authored the most dominant Trophy victory in TEG history, leading 72 of 72 holes in Stableford scoring and 64 of 72 in Gross. His third Trophy and maiden Jacket arrived via the first double-winner sweep the tour has witnessed. The margins expanded relentlessly, from five points after Round 1 to 21 by tournament's end.

Stuart Neumann's rally from catastrophic opening-round last place to runner-up stands as the comeback within the coronation. His Round 3 performance of 43 points, matching Williams's course-record effort at Penha Longa, lifted him 25 points in a single day. The closing quintuple-bogey at Oitavos Dunes could not undo the work.

John Patterson's challenge perished on the opening hole of Round 4, a ten at the first dropping him from second to third. David Mullin's eagle at West Cliffs in Round 2 proved a fleeting highlight; his Round 4 collapse of 22 points cost him third place in the Trophy. Alex Baker endured a tournament to forget, recording 13 zero-point holes and 20 worse-than-double-bogeys across 72 holes for his second career Wooden Spoon.

Williams claimed five birdies and 28 pars across four rounds. He held his nerve and his lead. This was a rout.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Williams led every hole of the tournament in Stableford scoring (72 of 72) and 64 of 72 holes in Gross, the most dominant performance in TEG history. His 21-point Trophy margin surpasses all previous winning margins.

Stuart Neumann recorded zero birdies across 72 holes yet finished second, the most consistent zero-birdie performance in tournament history. His 25-point single-round improvement from Round 1 to Round 3 represents the largest recovery from last place to runner-up.

The 18th hole at Oitavos Dunes claimed four players in Round 4, with Neumann, Jon Baker, Mullin, and Williams all suffering blow-ups. The opening hole of that round proved equally treacherous, with Patterson, Alex Baker, and Mullin all making eight or worse.

David Mullin's Round 2 eagle at West Cliffs's par-five 15th was the tournament's only eagle, a rare feat by TEG standards. His Round 4 collapse from third to fifth marked the largest final-round drop in Trophy standings this season.
