# TEG 7: A Study in Front-Running Perfection and Quintuple-Bogey Squalor {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 7 | Lisbon Coast | 2014</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Henry Meller led every single hole of this tournament. All seventy-two of them. From the opening par on Praia D'El Rey's first through to a triple-bogey finish on its eighteenth four rounds later, he never once relinquished control of the Trophy standings. This is either the purest expression of golfing dominance or a four-day exercise in competitive dread, depending on whether you've ever tried maintaining a lead while your pursuers post 51-point rounds behind you.

David Mullin claimed his fifth Green Jacket with a +53 gross performance that obliterated the field by fifteen strokes, posting the best single-round gross in tournament history (a +9 second-day masterclass that will haunt lesser players for years). Yet even this historic display couldn't catch Meller's Stableford stranglehold. Gregg Williams and Mullin tied for Trophy runner-up on 170 points, the closest second-place battle on record, while Alex Baker's debut yielded the Wooden Spoon with 152 points and a Round 4 featuring three quintuple bogeys that suggested someone had angered the Portuguese golf gods.

The Lisbon Coast offered three new venues and zero mercy. Praia D'El Rey's coastal dunes, Bom Sucesso's lagoon-side terror, and Royal Óbidos' Seve-designed brutality combined to produce a tournament where perfection and catastrophe shared the same scorecards. Par 4 14th holes cursed players in three separate rounds. This was golf as existential examination: how do you maintain composure when the universe keeps offering you chances to post quadruple figures?

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Henry Meller (1st, Trophy):** Wire-to-wire victor via a strategy of never looking back, occasionally looking sideways with concern, and twice posting zero-point disasters that somehow didn't derail the operation. Led every hole across four rounds. Took the first-tee lead with four points on H1 and spent seventy-one subsequent holes defending it like a man guarding the last sandwich at a wake. First Trophy after three consecutive Spoons, which is the TEG equivalent of geological uplift.

**David Mullin (T2nd, Trophy; 1st, Green Jacket):** Posted +53 across seventy-two holes, the best gross performance in tournament history, yet finished five Trophy points behind Meller because Stableford scoring is a beautiful instrument of cruelty. His +9 second round rewrote the record books. His fifteen-stroke Jacket margin was less a victory than a clinical demonstration. That he couldn't catch Meller despite this excellence is either tragedy or comedy, and possibly both simultaneously.

**Gregg Williams (T2nd, Trophy):** Dead-heated with Mullin for runner-up honours at 170 points, his best-ever finish, achieved via a 48-point final round that came too late to matter. Posted a quintuple bogey on Round 2's 15th that temporarily threatened his sanity, then responded in Round 4 like someone who'd decided dignity was overrated anyway. Finished +104 gross, which sounds catastrophic until you remember he tied for second.

**Stuart Neumann (4th, Trophy):** Tournament-high five birdies. A 49-point second round that tied his personal best. Finished one point behind the tie for second, which is the sporting equivalent of arriving at the train station as the doors close. His hot spells included two separate birdie runs that suggested genuine competence before reality reasserted itself.

**Jon Baker (5th, Trophy):** Led the Trophy standings for eight holes across the first two rounds, led the Jacket standings for twenty-one holes, then posted a sextuple bogey on Round 4's 10th that was less a golf hole and more a crime scene. Finished eleven points behind Meller despite opening with a birdie and briefly looking like someone who understood how this game worked.

**Alex Baker (6th, Trophy; Wooden Spoon):** Debut performance featuring 152 points, eight zero-point holes, and three Round 4 quintuple bogeys that read like a hostage note written by someone who'd lost count. One birdie in seventy-two holes. Finished twenty-three points behind fifth place. The Portuguese courses treated him like an unwelcome house guest who'd overstayed by three days and broken several ornaments.

## Round 1: Wire-to-Wire Begins {.round1 .round}

Praia D'El Rey Golf & Beach Resort: spectacular Links-Parkland hybrid, Cabell Robinson design, Top 60 in Continental Europe, dramatic coastal dunes on the back nine. The sort of course that looks beautiful in photographs and plays like targeted harassment in person. Par 73. The extra stroke did nobody any favours.

The tournament opened with Jon Baker birdieing the first hole, taking the Jacket lead, then immediately blowing up on the par-3 second with a septuple that announced his psychological state for the next seventy holes. Henry Meller took four points on the first, grabbed the Trophy lead, and never let go. By the eleventh hole, after Baker had briefly wrestled control back via a birdie on the sixth, Meller reclaimed the lead and settled in like someone who'd found a comfortable sofa and refused to leave. His back-nine surge (28 points to 21 on the front) included a four-pointer on the 14th, the first instance of that particular hole becoming a recurring character in this narrative.

David Mullin birdieed the par-3 fifth to briefly lead the Jacket race, then blow-up on the 18th with an octuple that cost him zero points and considerable dignity. Alex Baker recorded three zero-pointers before reaching the turn, posting blow-ups on holes 5, 10, and 14 that formed a neat geographical spread of disaster. Baker senior, meanwhile, led the Trophy standings through holes 6, 8, and 10 before Meller's consistency ground him down.

The round concluded with Meller ahead by two points, Jon Baker second despite his self-inflicted wounds, and Gregg Williams quietly third on 43 points. Mullin sat fourth despite leading the Jacket standings on gross score. The Portuguese coastline shimmered beautifully in the late sun, indifferent to the carnage it had witnessed.

## Round 2: The 51-Point Spectacular {.round2 .round}

Guardian Bom Sucesso Golf: Donald Steel design, Martin Ebert lead architect, contrasting flat front nine and hillier back nine with lagoon views. The sort of place where the scenery distracts you from the fact you've just triple-bogeyed two consecutive holes. Par 72. Still one too many.

Meller posted 51 points. Fifty-one. This broke his personal best, became the tournament record, and served as a mathematical middle finger to anyone who thought he might crack under pressure. His birdie on the par-5 seventh anchored a six-hole stretch worth twenty points. He took the Jacket lead on the twelfth hole, briefly lost it to Baker on the fourteenth, then reclaimed it on the fifteenth when Mullin triple-bogeyed. By round's end, Meller led the Trophy by ten points and the Jacket by three strokes. Complete dominance expressed in Stableford terms.

Stuart Neumann matched his personal best with 49 points, featuring birdies on holes 1 and 10 that bookended a round of genuine quality. David Mullin posted +9 gross, the best single-round performance in tournament history, yet managed only 46 points because Stableford scoring is an instrument designed by committee to punish excellence. His birdie on the seventh matched Meller's. His triple on the seventeenth matched nobody's, thankfully.

Alex Baker somehow recorded his personal-best Stableford round (42 points) despite opening with an octuple-bogey on the first hole. This is the golfing equivalent of recovering from a plane crash to win the lottery. Gregg Williams posted a quintuple on the 15th that temporarily ended his ambitions, triple-bogeyed the 14th and 7th for good measure, and finished with 38 points that felt like an insult after his solid opening round.

The par-4 14th claimed its second victim of the tournament. Pattern emerging.

## Round 3: Royal Óbidos and the 14th Hole Strikes Again {.round3 .round}

Royal Obidos Spa & Golf Resort: Seve Ballesteros' final design, Championship layout hosting European Challenge Tour events since 2020, dramatic water features. The Spaniard's legacy includes this brute of a course that treats amateur golfers like unwanted step-children. Par 72, which at this point felt optimistic.

Meller posted 37 points, his worst round of the tournament, yet extended his Trophy lead to twelve points through sheer bloody-minded consistency. He four-pointed the 14th hole, which by now had achieved folkloric status as a destroyer of dreams, then immediately blow-up on the 15th with a double-bogey-plus that cost him zero points and the Jacket lead. Triple-bogeyed the 17th for emphasis. Still led the Trophy. This was front-running as endurance test.

Mullin birdieed the par-3 third to take the Jacket lead, lost it by the fourth, then blow-up on the 15th (that hole again) with a quintuple that briefly threatened his composure and his Green Jacket dreams. Regained the Jacket lead by the sixteenth through sheer stubborn excellence elsewhere. Posted 39 points despite the disasters. Golf as damage limitation exercise.

Jon Baker opened with consecutive blow-ups on holes 2 and 3 (decuple and septuple respectively) that suggested someone had forgotten how clubs worked. Never recovered. Gregg Williams birdieed the 8th, four-pointed the 9th, then blow-up on the 14th with a nonuple that was the third instance of that particular hole eating someone alive. The pattern was no longer emerging. It had emerged, planted a flag, and started charging rent.

Alex Baker quietly posted 36 points, his joint-lowest round but devoid of the spectacular disasters that had marked earlier days. Sometimes survival counts as success.

## Round 4: Three Quintuples and a Trophy {.round4 .round}

Back to Praia D'El Rey for the finale: same spectacular dunes, same Par 73 pretensions, same capacity for violence. The course that had witnessed Round 1's opening salvos now hosted the closing chaos.

Williams and Neumann tied the round with 48 points each, the former posting his personal-best Stableford performance, the latter recording birdies on holes 2 and 7 that demonstrated genuine class. Both came too late to catch Meller, who posted a scrambling 38 points that included zero-pointers on holes 9 and 18 yet still secured the Trophy by five points. This was winning through accumulated advantage, the strategic equivalent of building a lead large enough to survive self-sabotage.

Mullin posted 45 points and +10 gross to clinch the Green Jacket by fifteen strokes, his fifth such victory, achieved with the casual dominance of someone who'd decided the gross competition was essentially amateur hour. His birdies on holes 11 and 17 bracketed a back-nine display of controlled excellence. His triple on the 10th suggested even dominance has limits.

Jon Baker posted a sextuple bogey on the par-5 tenth, an 11 on a hole you could theoretically reach in two shots, which is the mathematical equivalent of trying to fill a bathtub with a teaspoon while the drain's open. Zero-pointed the eleventh immediately afterward for good measure. Finished fifth. That he stayed fifth despite this collapse is testament to the cushion built earlier.

Alex Baker recorded three quintuple bogeys in one round. Three. Holes 6, 16, and arguably 3 (though that was technically "only" a septuple). Did manage a birdie on the par-3 fourteenth, which was less redemption and more proof that even broken clocks achieve accuracy twice daily. Finished with 152 points and the Wooden Spoon, twenty-three points behind fifth place, having played seventy-two holes that read like a case study in optimism meeting Portuguese reality.

Meller triple-bogeyed the 18th, posted zero points, and won anyway. Perfect summary of a wire-to-wire victory achieved through accumulated excellence and the strategic deployment of disaster at moments when his lead could absorb it.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Henry Meller led every hole of this tournament. Seventy-two consecutive holes of Trophy leadership, from opening drive to final putt, without once surrendering control. This had never been achieved before in tracked TEG history and may never be achieved again, assuming anyone else possesses the psychological fortitude to maintain composure while their rivals post 51-point rounds and historic gross performances behind them. His 175 Trophy points came via rounds of 49, 51, 37, and 38: a trajectory that peaked early and survived on accumulated advantage. Three zero-point disasters across four rounds. Won by five points. This was front-running as endurance sport.

David Mullin's +53 gross performance rewrote tournament records, his fifteen-stroke Jacket margin the widest ever recorded, yet he finished five Trophy points behind Meller because Stableford scoring rewards consistency over excellence and occasionally seems designed to punish ambition. His Round 2 masterclass (+9 gross, 46 points, best single-round gross in history) should have settled matters. It didn't. This was dominance expressed in terms that didn't matter for half the competition.

The tie for second Trophy place between Mullin and Williams (both 170 points) was the closest runner-up battle on record. Williams' career-best finish came via a final-round 48 that arrived too late. Neumann finished fourth on 169, one point behind, having posted five birdies and two personal-best rounds yet still missing the podium. Jon Baker spent eight holes leading the Trophy, twenty-one leading the Jacket, then posted a sextuple on Round 4's tenth that summarised the gap between aspiration and execution.

Alex Baker's debut: 152 points, eight zero-pointers, three Round 4 quintuples, one birdie. The Wooden Spoon by twenty-three points. The Portuguese courses treated him like someone who'd accidentally wandered onto a championship layout while looking for the pitch-and-putt. That he persevered through seventy-two holes of this treatment suggests either admirable determination or a fundamental misunderstanding of when to stop.

The par-4 14th holes became recurring villains across three courses, claiming victims in Rounds 1, 2, and 3 with a consistency that suggested deliberate malice. Praia D'El Rey's coastal beauty, Bom Sucesso's lagoon drama, and Royal Óbidos' Seve-designed brutality combined to produce a tournament where excellence and catastrophe coexisted on the same scorecards. Meller's wire-to-wire victory broke his three-Spoon streak and established him as TEG's first true front-runner. That he achieved this via a strategy of taking early control and never relinquishing it, despite occasional personal disasters, suggests he'd learned that in TEG golf, the lead is less a position and more a defensive fortification requiring constant maintenance.

Seventy-two holes. One wire-to-wire champion. Three quintuple bogeys in a single round. This was TEG 7.
