# TEG 12: Patterson's Metronomic March to Second Trophy

**Catalonia, Spain (2019) - PGA Catalunya Tour & Stadium courses**

John Patterson claimed his second Trophy with a masterclass in consistency, cruising home 10 points clear after seizing control in Round 3's chaotic 16-lead-change opening stretch. Jon Baker dominated the Green Jacket wire-to-wire, leading 58 of 72 holes and setting a Stadium course record of 89 (+17) in the final round to win by 8 strokes.

Patterson's victory was built on extraordinary metronomic precision rather than fireworks—his gross scores ranged just 23-25 across four rounds despite a +96 tournament total. He overcame catastrophic blow-ups at H4 Round 1 (+8) and combined disasters at H3/H7 Round 3 (+9) to grind out 172 points. Gregg Williams held both leads after Round 2 but imploded spectacularly in Round 3 with back-to-back meltdowns at H12-13 (+10 combined), falling to second place 10 points back. David Mullin earned his third Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in gross—four points adrift in last place after a roller-coaster final round (6 points across holes 2-7, then 11 points across holes 12-14).

Stuart Neumann punctuated a strong finish with the tournament's only eagle (H15 Round 4), capping back-nine surges of 17 and 23 points over the final two rounds to claim third in the Trophy. Baker and Patterson became the only Trophy and Jacket winners in TEG history to finish in opposite halves of each competition—Baker 4th in Stableford, Patterson 4th in gross.
