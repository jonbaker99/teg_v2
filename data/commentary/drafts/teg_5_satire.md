# TEG 5: The Paradox, the Collapse, and the Man Who Led From Nowhere {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 5 | Algarve | 2012</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

In which a man won the Green Jacket whilst simultaneously claiming the Wooden Spoon, a front-runner lost his nerve on the sixteenth hole, and Jon Baker discovered that leading from the front is vastly overrated as a strategic approach to competitive golf. The Algarve returned after a two-tournament absence, greeting the field with sunshine, ocean views, and the sort of golfing violence that makes actuaries weep. Baker claimed his second Trophy by leading Round 1, surrendering meekly in Rounds 2 and 3, then reclaiming control with the dogged resilience of a man who refuses to accept mathematical reality. David Mullin authored the tournament's defining absurdity: leading the Gross competition for all 72 holes whilst simultaneously finishing dead last in Stableford, a feat of such magnificent contradiction it deserves its own philosophical treatise. Gregg Williams, meanwhile, held the Trophy lead entering the final round only to author a quintuple bogey on the sixteenth hole that sealed his fate like a ransom note written in blood.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon Baker (Trophy Winner):** The second-time champion who led for thirty-six holes, lost for thirty-six more, then reclaimed the lead on the first hole of Round 4 and clung to it through five lead swaps like a man refusing to let go of a hot pan. His back-nine surge sealed victory. The front nine nearly unsealed everything.

**Gregg Williams (Runner-Up):** Held the lead entering Sunday only to discover that quintuple bogeys are not, in fact, part of any winning formula. Zero birdies across seventy-two holes suggests a man committed to the puritanical view that eagles and their smaller cousins are morally suspect.

**Henry Meller (3rd Place):** Achieved a personal-best final round that vaulted him to third, proving that timing is everything except when you time it one round too late. One birdie all tournament. A minimalist.

**Stuart Neumann (4th Place):** Authored a Round 2 explosion of forty-five points featuring an eleven-point birdie stretch, then spent the rest of the tournament wondering where that golfer had gone. Found him briefly, waved goodbye, continued spiraling.

**David Mullin (Green Jacket + Wooden Spoon):** Led the Gross competition for seventy-one of seventy-two holes with a fifty-four stroke margin whilst finishing last in Stableford by three points. Golf's only paradox with a handicap.

## Round 1: Welcome to the Theater of Operations {.round1 .round}

Boavista Golf & Spa Resort greeted the field with Atlantic views and deceptive tranquility, the sort of course that whispers sweet nothings before showing you its teeth. David Mullin birdied the third and fifth, establishing Gross dominance with the casual authority of a man annexing territory he already owns. Jon Baker, meanwhile, authored a quintuple bogey on the sixth hole that should have ended his tournament but somehow didn't, proving that golf operates on dream logic rather than mathematical principles.

Mullin's opening salvo continued unchecked. Two birdies, surgical precision, twelve over par that felt like dominance because everyone else was hemorrhaging strokes like trauma patients. Baker responded to his sixth-hole atrocity by birding the sixteenth, a moment of such brazen optimism it bordered on delusion. Williams triple-bogeyed the first, tenth, and seventeenth, then added a quintuple on seventeen for good measure, the sort of round that makes scorecards look like crime scene evidence. Stuart Neumann found five strokes over par on the fifth, eight on the sixteenth, seven on the eighteenth. The closing stretch resembled a traffic pileup in slow motion.

By day's end, Baker led the Trophy by a single point despite his sixth-hole implosion, proving that survival beats excellence when everyone's drowning. Mullin held the Jacket by eight strokes, a margin so vast it suggested he was playing a different sport entirely. The stage was set: dominance meeting chaos, order colliding with entropy, and four rounds still to play.

## Round 2: The Chaos Lobby Opens for Business {.round2 .round}

Boavista returned for Act Two with the same scenery but entirely different script. Baker triple-bogeyed the second and lost the lead immediately, the sort of capitulation that suggests mornings are optional. Williams blow up on the eighth for nine strokes, surrendering the lead he'd briefly held whilst simultaneously dropping to third. Eight lead changes across eighteen holes. Democracy in action, or possibly anarchy. No one seemed certain which.

Stuart Neumann discovered his inner Tour professional between the eighth and tenth holes, birdieing two of three for eleven Stableford points that vaulted him from last to fourth overall. The stretch featured a birdie on the eighth immediately after Williams authored his nine-stroke masterpiece, timing so exquisite it felt scripted. Neumann then proceeded to blow up the eighteenth for seven strokes, proving that what the golf gods give, they mostly take back with interest.

David Mullin birdied the eighth to seize the Trophy lead, then blow up the thirteenth to lose it, then reclaimed it on fourteen when everyone else imploded simultaneously. Henry Meller quintuple-bogeyed the sixteenth for ten strokes and watched his Stableford round crater like a meteorite strike. The back nine became a smoking ruin, thirty points evaporating into eight across six holes. Baker finished fourth for the round. Williams second. The leaderboard resembled a stock market crash played in reverse.

By evening, Mullin led the Trophy by one point despite his thirteen-stroke blow-up, proving that consistency is overrated when chaos reigns. His Gross lead remained untouchable: twenty-three total versus par. The Jacket was his. The Trophy remained anyone's guess.

## Round 3: The Weekend Massacre {.round3 .round}

Boavista's final appearance unfolded like a Jacobean revenge tragedy: lots of bodies, minimal dignity, everyone guilty. Mullin birdied the first, then triple-bogeyed the second, establishing the round's pattern of promise meeting ruin. Williams seized the Trophy lead on the third hole, then blow up the eighth, ninth, and twelfth in succession, the sort of scorecard violence that suggests someone angered the wrong deity. Baker took the lead on the seventeenth with a par that felt heroic only by comparison, then surrendered it immediately on eighteen with a quintuple bogey that summarized everyone's afternoon.

Mullin's collapse accelerated. Seven strokes on the tenth. Nine on the thirteenth. Seven on the seventeenth. Twenty-seven Stableford points for the round, his personal worst across fourteen rounds played, proving that dominance in one metric guarantees catastrophe in another. The Gross lead remained secure because everyone else was busy authoring their own disasters. Neumann blow up the second, seventeenth, and eighteenth. Williams tallied three triple-bogeys and one quadruple across the back nine alone. The course became a charnel house.

Final-hole drama: Baker led by one approaching eighteen. Williams trailed by one. Mullin had already immolated. The eighteenth played like a morality tale. Baker found nine strokes and zero points. Williams found seven strokes and the Trophy lead. Golf's version of "last man standing" when everyone's crawling.

## Round 4: The Collapse, the Surge, and the Paradox {.round4 .round}

Palmares Golf's Praia loop provided fresh scenery for the final act: seaside links golf where the ocean watches you fail with disinterested majesty. Baker reclaimed the Trophy lead on the first hole despite entering the round one behind, then birdied the third to extend it, the sort of opening statement that suggested resolve or possibly madness. Williams answered immediately: Baker quintuple-bogeyed the fifth for eight strokes and zero points, handing the lead straight back. The pendulum swung five times across the opening thirteen holes. Democracy as blood sport.

Baker's decisive move came between the thirteenth and fifteenth: two birdies sandwiching a par that sealed the Trophy. Twenty-two back-nine points erased Williams' hopes with surgical precision. Williams, meanwhile, authored the tournament's defining moment on sixteen: a quintuple bogey for nine strokes that transformed a tight race into a formality. Zero points. Zero hope. The scoreboard updated like a death notice. He'd led entering the round. He finished three behind.

Mullin's final round completed the tournament's central paradox. Thirty Stableford points to finish dead last by three. Wire-to-wire Gross dominance with a fifty-four stroke margin. Fourth Green Jacket. First Wooden Spoon. The mathematical impossibility made flesh. Henry Meller closed with a personal-best thirty-nine points to claim third, proving that peaking on Sunday matters only if you peaked harder on Saturday. Neumann struggled through four triple-bogeys to finish fourth, his Round 2 explosion now a distant memory filed under "what might have been."

Final accounting: Baker won by three points after leading for thirty-six holes total, losing the lead for thirty-six more, then reclaiming it permanently on Round 4's opening hole. Williams held the lead for thirty holes across the tournament but none when it mattered. Mullin led the Gross for seventy-one holes whilst finishing last in Stableford. The scorecards resembled philosophical treatises written by someone who'd lost the plot halfway through.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

TEG 5 belonged to Jon Baker by virtue of resilience masquerading as strategy, to David Mullin by virtue of a paradox that defies sporting logic, and to Gregg Williams by virtue of how not to close a tournament when you're holding all the cards. Baker's victory followed the template of a man who led, surrendered, then remembered he preferred leading after all. His final round featured five lead swaps with Williams before birdies on thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen settled matters with the finality of a judge's gavel. Williams entered Sunday one point clear only to author a sixteenth-hole quintuple that stands as the tournament's epitaph: ambition meeting geometry in an alley after dark.

Mullin's achievement transcends normal sporting categories. Wire-to-wire Gross dominance paired with finishing last in Stableford by three points represents golf's only true paradox: simultaneous excellence and catastrophe measured in different units. His fourth Green Jacket came paired with his first Wooden Spoon, like receiving an OBE whilst simultaneously being declared bankrupt. Stuart Neumann's forty-five-point Round 2 included an eleven-point birdie stretch between eight and ten that will stand as the tournament's lone moment of conventional brilliance, immediately followed by three rounds of spiraling mediocrity that confirmed the golf gods' sense of cosmic balance.

Forty-four triple-bogeys or worse across seventy-two holes. Thirty-three Stableford zeros. Zero lead changes in the Trophy race after Round 3 despite five swaps in Round 4. The Algarve sun watched it all with the patience of something that's seen worse. Baker leaves with his second Trophy. Mullin with his contradictory double. Williams with the knowledge that quintuple bogeys end dreams. The scorecards have been filed. The memories remain inadmissible as evidence.
