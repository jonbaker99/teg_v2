## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker swept both competitions with ruthless efficiency, controlling the Trophy and Jacket leads for 59 and 70 of 72 holes respectively. The venue, returning to Catalonia after a five-event gap, offered glorious Spanish sunshine and the championship pedigree of PGA Catalunya's Stadium and Tour layouts. His margin of six points came courtesy of brother Alex's spectacular final-day collapse, a career-worst 27 points featuring five triple bogeys that squandered the Trophy lead by the sixth hole. Gregg Williams claimed third with consistent mid-thirties scoring, whilst John Patterson's wild swings delivered both Round One's nightmare 26 points and Round Four's tournament-best 36. David Mullin's Wooden Spoon told a peculiar tale: second in the Jacket with steady gross play, yet dead last in Stableford, his conservative approach failing to register points when it mattered.

## Round 1: PATTERSON'S HORROR SHOW CLEARS PATH {.round1 .round}

PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course presented its championship credentials immediately. Jon Baker held a narrow three-point advantage heading into Girona's signature test. The Trophy lead changed hands five times across the opening eighteen holes.

John Patterson seized the initiative with a four-point par at the first. Three holes later he was in freefall. A quintuple bogey at the fourth cost him the lead. Further carnage followed: an eight at the tenth, another blow-up at the twelfth, then a nine at the thirteenth that deposited him firmly at the bottom. Six zero-point holes left him with 26 points and forty over par. Gregg Williams endured his own horrors on the front nine, posting triple bogeys at the second and fifth before a birdie four at the fifteenth offered brief respite. Alex Baker's double at the second signalled trouble, compounded by further disasters at the eleventh and thirteenth.

Jon Baker survived his own triple bogey at the eighteenth to post 35 points. Alex trailed by three on 32. Williams rallied to 30 despite his early struggles, whilst Dave McDowell's 29 points left him within striking distance.

## Round 2: BAKER MATCHES COURSE RECORD {.round2 .round}

The Tour Course brought opportunity for redemption. Jon Baker arrived with modest leads in both competitions, two strokes clear in the Jacket race. His 84 would equal the all-time course record, yet his brother would claim the day's best Stableford haul.

Both Bakers found birdies at the second, matching David Mullin's rare moment of excellence. Alex posted fours at the third, eighth, and thirteenth, building a tournament-high 42 points to close within two of Jon's overall lead. Gregg Williams answered his opening-nine struggles with a back-nine charge: 22 points included a birdie three at the seventeenth. Jon's 41 points maintained control, but a triple bogey at the seventeenth served notice that perfection remained elusive.

Patterson's chaos continued: six-over at the fifteenth, further blow-ups at the fourth, fifth, seventh, tenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth. His 34 points left him trailing by a dozen.

## Round 3: BROTHERS TRADE BLOWS AT EL PRAT {.round3 .round}

El Prat's Azul Course hosted its first TEG event. Alex Baker arrived two points adrift, Jon protecting his Jacket advantage by eighteen strokes. The lead would change hands twice across a brutal afternoon.

Alex opened with a three-point five at the first to snatch the Trophy lead. One hole later, a double bogey handed it straight back. Jon responded with a birdie at the ninth to extend breathing room, but consecutive blow-ups at the twelfth and thirteenth cost him the advantage. Alex's par three at the thirteenth returned him to the summit. Patterson posted the round's best figures, 39 points including back-to-back fours at the sixteenth and seventeenth, climbing within touching distance. Williams produced his most consistent display, 35 points split evenly across the nines after shaking off early doubles at the second and fifth.

David Mullin briefly led the Jacket between the third and sixth holes but triple bogeys at the sixth, eleventh, and thirteenth sent him spiralling towards the Spoon. Jon's 32 points left him two behind Alex entering the decider.

## Round 4: ALEX'S MELTDOWN HANDS JON DOUBLE {.round4 .round}

The Stadium Course returned for the finale. Alex held a two-point Trophy lead, Jon a comfortable Jacket cushion of eighteen. Within six holes, the tournament was decided.

Alex's triple bogey at the sixth surrendered both his advantage and his composure. Jon seized the lead with a bogey six. Alex managed four points from the next six holes before total implosion: an eight at the ninth, another at the twelfth, a final disaster at the seventeenth. Five triple bogeys yielded 27 points, his career-worst across twenty rounds. Nine holes produced precisely zero Stableford return. Patterson countered with the round's best display, 36 points featuring a four-point par at the seventeenth, but the damage from Round One proved insurmountable.

Williams posted 32 points to secure third overall, whilst Mullin's 31 points and level gross play with Jon confirmed an unusual Spoon outcome: second-best in the Jacket, last in the Trophy.

Jon's 35 points sealed a six-point margin and a first Green Jacket by three strokes.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's sweep represented the most commanding performance in TEG history to that point. Leading 59 of 72 holes in the Trophy and 70 in the Jacket, he never truly relinquished control despite his brother's Round Three surge. His 84 in Round Two matched the course record set at TEG 6, yet no one bettered it across four days. Two birdies told the story of his conservative excellence: par golf supplemented by rare moments of brilliance proved sufficient.

Alex's collapse defined the tournament's narrative arc. His 42-point second round suggested genuine threat, but the final-day 27 represented Stableford scoring at its most brutal. Five triple bogeys, nine pointless holes, thirty-four over par. The sixteen-point swing between Rounds Two and Four captured golf's unforgiving arithmetic. Williams delivered precisely what his game promised: three rounds in the 30s, consistency without fireworks, a podium finish earned through avoidance of catastrophe.

Patterson's volatility matched his reputation. Eight blow-ups in Round One, six across the next three. A thirteen-point improvement from worst to best round illustrated the fine margins, yet the early damage proved terminal. Mullin's Spoon carried footnotes: his gross scoring bettered three rivals, yet Stableford demands aggression alongside steadiness. Second in the Jacket, last in the Trophy. That curious duality defined his week in Catalonia, where Spain's premier courses punished conservatism as ruthlessly as they did chaos.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (1st):** Second Trophy, first Jacket, achieved with the tournament's most complete performance. Led from the opening round and surrendered the advantage for barely thirteen holes across four days. His Round Two 84 matched PGA Catalunya's course record, whilst consistency rather than brilliance characterised his triumph. Two birdies across 72 holes told the tale.

**Alex BAKER (2nd):** Six points behind after Round Four's catastrophic 27-point implosion erased a two-point lead. Five triple bogeys and nine zero-point holes represented a career-worst across twenty rounds, the collapse beginning at the sixth hole and accelerating through the back nine. His tournament-best 42 points in Round Two hinted at what might have been.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd):** Solid throughout with rounds of 30, 39, 35, and 32 points securing the final podium place. A single birdie matched Jon's modest total, consistency his calling card. Back-nine strength in Round Two (22 points) and Round Three (20 points) provided the platform.

**John PATTERSON (4th):** Extreme volatility defined his week: Round One's nightmare 26 points featured eight blow-ups and six zero-point holes, yet Round Four's 36 matched the tournament's best Stableford display. Held the Trophy lead for four holes across the competition, but opening-day damage proved insurmountable.

**David MULLIN (5th):** The Wooden Spoon concealed peculiarity. Second in the Jacket by just three strokes, his conservative gross play earned respect yet Stableford demands more. Led the Jacket race briefly in Rounds Three and Four but multiple blow-ups (particularly a six-over at Round Two's fifteenth) torpedoed his points tally. Last in the Trophy despite second-best gross scoring.

## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}

**Course Record Equalled:** Jon BAKER's 84 (+12) in Round 2 matched the PGA Catalunya Tour Course record (previously: 84, TEG 6).

**Personal Worst:** Alex BAKER's 27 points (Stableford) in Round 4 (previous best: 32 points, multiple occasions; worst of twenty career rounds).

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Jon Baker's dominance extended beyond the leaderboard: his 70-hole Jacket lead represented the longest in competition history to that point. Only six birdies across the entire field over 72 holes highlighted the courses' defensive qualities. No eagles were recorded, making birdies the tournament's premium commodity. Alex Baker's sixteen-point swing between Round Two (42 points) and Round Four (27 points) marked the competition's largest single-player variance. John Patterson's thirteen-point improvement from Round One to Round Four (26 to 36 points) demonstrated golf's capacity for redemption, even as his opening-day chaos cost him a podium finish.
