## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams claimed his third TEG Trophy with a commanding performance across the Lisbon Coast, leading all 72 holes to win by 12 points despite a dozen blow-ups. David Mullin secured an unprecedented sixth Green Jacket, winning by six strokes with a composed final round featuring birdies at the 13th and 16th at Oitavos Dunes. The competition played across four pristine Portuguese courses, each newly added to the Tour rota: Robert Trent Jones Sr.'s Quinta da Marinha, the dramatic Penha Longa mountain course, and Arthur Hills's world-renowned Oitavos Dunes links.

Williams's victory thesis centred on relentless point accumulation. His rounds of 38, 41, 29, and 41 built an insurmountable advantage. Mullin's gross dominance told a different story, leading the Jacket race for 63 of 72 holes while finishing fourth in Stableford. Jon Baker held the Jacket lead through 54 holes but surrendered it early in the final round. Stuart Neumann endured 23 meltdowns en route to his first Wooden Spoon.

## Round 1: Quinta da Marinha Mayhem {.round1 .round}

The tournament opened at Quinta da Marinha, a parkland gem nestled in a pine forest estate north of Cascais. Williams entered with a four-point lead to defend. The Trophy battle and Jacket race were locked in tight formation.

Williams seized control at the 10th, a par five where his birdie sparked an 11-point surge across three holes. Alex Baker imploded simultaneously at the same hole, posting a nine to surrender the early Trophy advantage. The shift was seismic. Williams racked up level par for the stretch while Baker averaged nearly four over. Jon Baker nailed a birdie at the 17th but had already blown up with a nine at the 13th, costing him the Jacket lead. David Mullin's birdie at the second kept him in early contention.

Stuart Neumann's round unravelled spectacularly. An eight at the opening hole set the tone. He followed with blow-ups at the ninth, tenth, 11th, 12th, and 14th. Four players registered nines or worse at the par-five 10th. Henry Meller recorded a ten at the third but salvaged a birdie at the fifth to stay competitive.

## Round 2: Penha Longa's Mountain Test {.round2 .round}

The field moved to Penha Longa, Robert Trent Jones Jr.'s mountain course in the Sintra hills. Williams carried a four-point Trophy cushion. Mullin held a one-stroke Jacket advantage. The steep terrain and ocean vistas awaited.

Williams extended his Trophy lead to 11 points with a 41-point masterclass, despite a quintuple at the par-five 12th. He banked four-pointers at the fourth, seventh, and tenth on the front nine, building an 18-point haul over six holes. Mullin matched the round's best score at 36 points with a birdie at the sixth, maintaining his Jacket lead with the day's lowest gross of 86. Alex Baker also posted 36 points but couldn't gain ground in the Gross competition.

The 12th became a graveyard. Williams posted a ten. Meller managed an eight. Neumann added a nine. The 16th proved equally destructive: Meller, Neumann, Alex Baker, and Jon Baker all registered blow-ups, with Meller and Neumann posting quintuple bogeys or worse. Henry Meller's front nine of 18 points disintegrated into a nine-point back nine. Neumann's early promise of 19 points on the front faded to 12 on the inward stretch.

## Round 3: Back to Quinta da Marinha {.round3 .round}

The field returned to Quinta da Marinha for round three. Williams held an 11-point Trophy lead. Mullin protected a six-stroke Jacket margin. Drama loomed on the coastal parkland.

Williams suffered back-to-back calamities at the 10th and 11th, posting a nine followed by a ten. The consecutive blow-ups cost him 11 over par for two holes. His lead shrank from 11 points to five. Jon Baker capitalised with a 35-point performance, highlighted by a strong back nine of 20 points. Baker seized the Jacket lead at the 12th when Mullin stumbled. Mullin briefly reclaimed it at the 15th before losing it again at the 17th. Baker finished with the Jacket advantage by two strokes.

Alex Baker recorded a six-over-par blow-up at the eighth. Neumann's horrors continued: a ten at the opening hole, a nine at the fourth, and an 11 at the par-five 10th. His three blow-ups on the front nine mirrored his sustained collapse. Meller steadied with a 34-point round to stay in touch.

## Round 4: Oitavos Dunes Showdown {.round4 .round}

The tournament concluded at Oitavos Dunes, Portugal's premier links and the country's top-ranked course. Williams needed to protect a five-point Trophy cushion. Baker defended a two-stroke Jacket lead against Mullin.

Neumann opened with a birdie at the first, a rare bright spot. The second hole redrew the Jacket race. Baker posted a seven to blow up and lose the lead. Mullin took command immediately. Henry Meller's front nine imploded catastrophically: blow-ups at the second, third, fourth, and fifth produced just eight points across nine holes, averaging close to five over par per hole. Alex Baker peppered the round with four-pointers at the third, 10th, and 12th, posting 39 points to climb into second place overall.

Williams cruised to 41 points, matching his second-round total to secure the Trophy by 12 points. His back nine of 24 points sealed the margin. Mullin applied the finishing touches with birdies at the par-five 13th and 16th. The 13th birdie earned him four points. His composed play through the closing stretch delivered the Jacket by six strokes. Jon Baker managed 28 points but couldn't recover from the second-hole meltdown.

The 18th witnessed widespread carnage. Alex Baker, Mullin, Meller, and Neumann all registered blow-ups. Neumann's collapse included additional horror holes at the 14th and 17th, cementing his Spoon finish 49 points behind Williams.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Gregg Williams authored a start-to-finish triumph, becoming the first player to lead all 72 holes of a TEG tournament. His 149-point total withstood 12 blow-ups, testament to his relentless point accumulation across four rounds of 38, 41, 29, and 41. The third-round wobble at Quinta da Marinha, where back-to-back calamities shrank his lead to five points, proved his only vulnerability. He rebuilt the cushion at Oitavos Dunes with a composed final performance.

David Mullin claimed his sixth Green Jacket, the most in TEG history. His gross total of +77 bettered Jon Baker by six strokes despite finishing fourth in Stableford. Mullin's four birdies across the week included crucial strikes at the final round's 13th and 16th to secure victory. His consistent net play earned fourth place in the Trophy race, a rare dual excellence. Baker held the Jacket lead for 15 holes but surrendered it at the fourth round's second hole and never recovered.

Alex Baker surged to second place in the Trophy standings with a strong final-round 39 points, but 25 worse-than-double-bogeys relegated him to sixth in the Jacket race. Henry Meller's catastrophic final-round front nine, where four consecutive blow-ups yielded eight points, dropped him to fifth overall. Stuart Neumann's 23 blow-ups, including five holes registering quintuple bogeys or worse, earned him his first Wooden Spoon. His 49-point deficit to the winner marked a comprehensive struggle.

Williams's victory combined ruthless consistency with dramatic volatility. His 12 blow-ups highlighted the paradox: vulnerable yet dominant. Mullin's sixth Jacket extended his record tally, underlining a career of gross excellence.
