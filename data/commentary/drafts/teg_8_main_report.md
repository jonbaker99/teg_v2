## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams seized the TEG Trophy lead at Quinta da Marinha's 10th hole on the opening day and never looked back, cruising to a 12-point victory in Portugal. David Mullin claimed his sixth Green Jacket with a final-round flourish at Oitavos Dunes, overtaking Jon Baker with two birdies in the closing stretch. The two competitions diverged throughout, Williams compiling 149 points while never threatening in Gross, Mullin steadily accumulating strokes while barely registering on the Stableford leaderboard.

Williams extended his Trophy lead to 11 points after Round 2 at Penha Longa and never came close to relinquishing it. Baker led the Gross after three rounds before Mullin pounced on the second hole of the finale. The tournament unfolded across four new Portuguese venues, each contributing its own brand of carnage.

## Round 1: Quinta Carnage {.round1 .round}

The TEG arrived on Portugal's Estoril Coast for the first time, facing Robert Trent Jones Sr.'s classic parkland design at Quinta da Marinha. Williams held a four-point Trophy lead by day's end. Mullin led the Jacket by a single stroke over Baker.

The round began benignly before the 10th hole announced itself as the day's executioner. Williams rolled in a birdie to claim the Trophy lead. The other five players watched in varying degrees of horror. Alex Baker recorded a nine. Jon Baker made eight. Stuart Neumann also made nine, the first of six consecutive holes without a point. The Par 5 claimed four blow-ups in total, setting the tone for a venue that would punish the slightest lapse in concentration.

Alex Baker epitomised the day's split personality. He collected 20 points on the front nine, then imploded on the back. An eight at the 12th was followed by zeros at 16, 17, and 18. He finished with 30 points despite failing to register on six holes. Jon Baker recovered from his 10th-hole nightmare with a birdie at the 17th, salvaging 34 points.

Neumann's opening tee shot disappeared into the trees for an eight. His round never recovered. He made nine at the 10th, nine at the 11th, nine at the 12th, then eight at the 14th. Four consecutive blow-ups in six holes. His 17 points represented a personal and all-time TEG worst for Stableford.

## Round 2: Penha Longa Pandemonium {.round2 .round}

The TEG moved inland to the Sintra hills and Robert Trent Jones Jr.'s mountainous Atlantic Course at Penha Longa. Williams extended his Trophy advantage. Mullin maintained his Jacket lead with a steady 14-over gross, Baker lurking five strokes behind.

Williams started brilliantly, collecting 18 points across six holes. He picked up four points at the 4th, another four at the 7th, another four at the 10th. Then the 12th hole intervened with a 10, wiping out his momentum. He still compiled 41 points, his Trophy cushion now 11. The margin would never fall below five again.

The 12th and 16th holes produced wholesale destruction. Williams, Henry Meller, and Neumann all succumbed at the Par 5 12th. The 16th saw four players fail to register a point: Meller (+5), Neumann (+5), Alex Baker (+4), and Jon Baker (+3). Alex Baker added a nine at the closing Par 5 for good measure, yet still salvaged 36 points.

Mullin compiled his round with minimal drama. A birdie at the 6th kept him ahead. Baker matched him blow for blow, closing the Jacket gap to five strokes. Meller produced a front nine of 18 points before recording zeros at 12, 13, and 16.

## Round 3: Quinta Collapse {.round3 .round}

The TEG returned to Quinta da Marinha. Williams stumbled but maintained a five-point Trophy cushion with 29 points. Baker produced the day's best Gross round of 18 (+2) to seize the Jacket lead for the first time.

Williams suffered his worst stretch of the tournament. He made nine at the 10th and 10 at the 11th, two consecutive blow-ups costing him dearly. Six holes from the 6th through the 11th yielded just five points. Yet his earlier cushion remained sufficient. He still led by five at day's end.

Alex Baker endured the round's defining calamity at the 8th. A 10 represented his worst score of the week. He failed to register on the hole, his 12th zero of the tournament. Yet he recovered with a birdie at the 17th, finishing with 32 points. Jon Baker capitalised on Williams's and Mullin's struggles, posting 20 points on the back nine. His 18 gross moved him ahead in the Jacket.

Mullin wobbled across the middle holes. Zeros at the 7th, 10th, and 12th saw him slip behind Baker. He briefly reclaimed the lead at the 15th before losing it for good at the 17th. Neumann compiled another miserable card, six zeros contributing to 20 points and a 43 gross.

## Round 4: Oitavos Denouement {.round4 .round}

The TEG concluded at Portugal's premier venue, Arthur Hills's spectacular links at Oitavos Dunes. Williams compiled 41 points to seal his Trophy by 12. Mullin overtook Baker with a 17 gross (+5) featuring two birdies, winning the Jacket by six strokes.

The Jacket battle ended abruptly at the 2nd hole. Baker made seven, failing to register a point. Mullin rolled in a five for a single point. The lead changed hands. It would not return. Mullin collected birdies at the 13th and 16th, both Par 5s, building an insurmountable advantage. Baker could only watch, his excellent third round erased by a 25 gross on the final day.

Williams never deviated from his Trophy march. A blow-up at the 5th barely registered. He collected 24 points on the back nine, his 41 matching his Round 2 total. Alex Baker posted 39 points to finish second in the Trophy, 12 behind. His 13 zeros across the week told the story of remarkable front-nine scoring undermined by recurring collapses.

Meller endured a front-nine meltdown, failing to register points at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Four consecutive blow-ups mirrored his Round 2 struggles. He made 10 at the 4th and nine at the 5th, finishing with eight points on the outward half. Neumann provided the round's sole early brightness with a birdie at the 1st before resuming normal service.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Gregg Williams delivered one of the TEG's most commanding performances, leading the Trophy for all 72 holes after seizing control at Quinta da Marinha's 10th in Round 1. His four-round total of 149 points never faced serious challenge after extending to 11 at Penha Longa. David Mullin's sixth Green Jacket arrived via a patient accumulation strategy, trailing Jon Baker through 56 holes before pouncing with a final-day 17 gross featuring birdies at the 13th and 16th.

The two competitions diverged throughout. Williams barely registered in Gross, finishing 30 strokes behind Mullin. Mullin struggled for Stableford points, finishing fourth in the Trophy. Baker claimed dual runner-up honours, 12 points behind in Trophy and six strokes adrift in Jacket. Alex Baker produced the week's most puzzling performance, compiling 137 Trophy points despite 13 zeros, including a catastrophic 10 at Round 3's 8th.

Stuart Neumann claimed the Wooden Spoon with 100 points and a tournament-high 23 zeros. His opening 17 points at Quinta da Marinha represented the lowest Stableford round in TEG history. Certain holes produced wholesale carnage. The 10th at Quinta da Marinha claimed four blow-ups in Round 1. Penha Longa's 12th and 16th exacted similar revenge in Round 2.

Williams's wire-to-wire authority ended any drama by halfway. Mullin's Jacket challenge provided the tournament's sole sustained narrative tension before his final-day birdies settled matters. Four new Portuguese venues each contributed to the spectacle, though none could match the drama of who would prevail.

**Alex Baker (2nd Trophy):** Compiled 137 points despite 13 zeros, epitomising the tournament's volatility. Opened Round 1 with 20 front-nine points before collapsing on the back, repeated the pattern throughout the week including a catastrophic 10 at Round 3's 8th.

**Jon Baker (T2 Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Claimed dual runner-up honours after leading the Jacket through Round 3 with an excellent 18 gross. Lost the lead on Round 4's 2nd hole and could not recover, finishing six strokes behind Mullin.

**David Mullin (4th Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Won his sixth Green Jacket with patient stroke accumulation and final-day heroics. Trailed Baker for 56 holes before overtaking at Round 4's 2nd, sealed victory with birdies at the 13th and 16th.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

David Mullin set the Oitavos Dunes course record with his final-round 17 gross, the lowest Gross round ever recorded at the venue. Gregg Williams's 149 Trophy points represented the third-highest Stableford total in TEG history. Stuart Neumann's 23 zeros established a new tournament record for failed scoring opportunities, surpassing the previous mark by seven.

The 10th hole at Quinta da Marinha produced four blow-ups in Round 1, matching the single-hole carnage record. Penha Longa's 12th and 16th holes each claimed multiple victims in Round 2. Alex Baker's front-to-back scoring differential of 10 points in Round 1 represented the week's widest single-round swing.

Henry Meller's four consecutive opening blow-ups in Round 4 matched the tournament record for consecutive holes without a point to start a round. Jon Baker's Round 3 score of 18 gross represented the best Jacket round of the week, insufficient to prevent Mullin's final-day surge.
