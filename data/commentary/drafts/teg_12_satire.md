# TEG 12: A Taxonomy of Chaos, Or How Everything Changed {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 12 | Catalonia | 2019</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

What followed was less a golf tournament and more a comprehensive study in the psychology of optimism meeting reality. Four rounds across PGA Catalunya's Tour and Stadium courses produced 162 lead changes across the first ten holes of Round 3 alone, before John PATTERSON's metronomic consistency conquered the chaos. His victory margin of ten points represented the mathematical opposite of entertainment. Meanwhile, Jon BAKER led 58 of 72 holes in the Green Jacket race, which he won by eight strokes, whilst finishing fourth in Stableford. David MULLIN's tournament defied the laws of physics entirely: second in Gross scoring, dead last in points by four. The Wooden Spoon has never been awarded with such existential confusion.

The Stadium course, ranked fifth in Continental Europe by people who presumably measure such things, watched BAKER set a course record 89 in Round 4. PATTERSON's gross scores varied by just two strokes across four days, despite posting +96 overall. This was golf as bureaucratic procedure, victory through paperwork rather than pyrotechnics.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**John PATTERSON (Trophy Winner, 172pts, +96):** Led the tournament for 48 of 72 holes despite six Stableford zeros and a Round 1 opening that included a twelve at the 4th. His gross scores ranged from 23 to 25, suggesting a man who'd discovered the formula for controlled mediocrity. Survived catastrophic blow-ups at H4 R1, H15 R2, and H3 R3 to win by ten points. Standard deviation of 0.82 across rounds represents either remarkable consistency or a complete inability to improve.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd, 162pts, +76):** Held both leads after Round 2, then authored golf's equivalent of a Victorian tragedy at H12-13 in Round 3. Ten strokes combined, zero points collected, hope extinguished. Led 33 holes total before the wheels came catastrophically off. His collapse made PATTERSON's victory possible whilst simultaneously creating a moral vacuum.

**Stuart NEUMANN (3rd, 155pts, +108):** Matched PATTERSON's six Stableford zeros in what can only be described as competitive symmetry. His eagle at H15 R4 punctuated a back-nine surge that came far too late to matter. Front nine 17 points, back nine 23 in the final round. Mathematically impressive, strategically useless.

**Jon BAKER (Green Jacket Winner, 145pts, +63):** Won wire-to-wire with an eight-stroke margin, leading 58 of 72 holes. Finished fourth in Stableford, which suggests the scoring systems are measuring entirely different sports. Set course record 89 at PGA Catalunya Stadium in Round 4. Collected four birdies across the tournament and zero eagles, proving dominance requires neither excitement nor drama.

**Alex BAKER (5th, 143pts, +104):** Opened with a seven at the 1st and proceeded downward from there. Hit bottom at the 2nd hole of Round 1 with seven strokes, zero points, and presumably zero dignity remaining. Tied the final round lead with 40 points, which felt like apology rather than achievement.

**David MULLIN (Wooden Spoon, 139pts, +71):** Won his third Spoon whilst posting the second-best Gross total, finishing 23 points behind fifth place in Stableford. His Round 4 featured six points across holes 2-7, then eleven points at holes 12-14, suggesting a man playing two separate tournaments simultaneously. Neither went well enough.

## Round 1: In Which Everything Begins Badly {.round1 .round}

The Tour course at PGA Catalunya received six players like a Victorian asylum receiving new patients. Hope met tee time. Both were equally delusional.

Jon BAKER opened with a seven at the 1st, collecting zero points whilst his brother Alex replicated the feat. Familial solidarity through incompetence. BAKER the elder seized the Trophy lead at the very same hole, which told you everything about the standards that would follow. By the 2nd, Alex had reached the bottom of the standings with another zero. He remained there, contemplating his life choices, whilst PATTERSON added a six at the Par 3 for three over.

Then came the 4th hole, where PATTERSON authored a twelve. Not a typographical error. Twelve strokes, eight over par, zero points, and presumably a brief conversation with whatever gods oversee sporting humiliation. This was golfing graffiti on the scorecard, an act of competitive self-harm that should have ended his tournament before lunch.

Instead, something remarkable occurred. PATTERSON collected four points at the 8th, four more at the 9th, then four at the 11th. Holes 8-13 yielded 22 points total. This represented either recovery or Stockholm Syndrome. BAKER (Jon) responded with birdies at the 3rd and 14th, taking the Jacket lead at the latter before Gregg WILLIAMS seized it at the 18th. Stuart NEUMANN, meanwhile, recorded blow-ups at the 5th, 13th, and 15th. The 15th produced a twelve to match PATTERSON's earlier masterpiece. Symmetry in suffering.

WILLIAMS posted 46 points to lead by one over PATTERSON. J. BAKER matched Williams at +12 Gross to share that lead. Everyone else contemplated whether golf was actually fun or simply theatrical masochism.

## Round 2: The Illusion of Control {.round2 .round}

Back on the Tour course, WILLIAMS maintained both leads with the calm of a man who didn't yet know what awaited. PATTERSON took the Trophy lead at the 4th after Williams recorded an eight for zero points. Order appeared restored. It wasn't.

Stuart NEUMANN collected a birdie at the 6th, adding four points, as part of a stretch where holes 4-9 yielded 19 points. This represented peak NEUMANN. Holes 8-13 produced another 19. Then normality resumed and he finished with 44 points, highest of the round but third overall. Mathematical glory, positional irrelevance.

WILLIAMS regained the Jacket lead at the 10th with a birdie. Alex BAKER matched it. The leaderboard churned like bureaucratic machinery processing failure. PATTERSON reached the 15th and authored a catastrophic ten for zero points, surrendering the Trophy lead he'd held since the 4th. This was the tournament's first genuine turning point, though nobody recognized it at the time.

David MULLIN posted 40 points and +12 Gross, matching J. BAKER's opening round. This represented peak MULLIN. The rest of his tournament would be descent disguised as participation. Jon BAKER collected 36 points whilst maintaining the Jacket lead at +16 overall. His brother Alex managed 37 points despite blow-ups at the 7th and 9th, proof that the scoring system rewards survival as much as excellence.

WILLIAMS held both leads. PATTERSON trailed by one point. The tournament balanced on a knife edge constructed entirely of incompetence.

## Round 3: The Great Unraveling {.round3 .round}

The Stadium course, ranked amongst Continental Europe's elite, witnessed administrative chaos masquerading as competition. PATTERSON took the Trophy lead at the 1st. WILLIAMS reclaimed it at the 2nd whilst seizing the Jacket lead. Both Bakers recorded blow-ups. MULLIN joined them. NEUMANN contributed a seven. The 2nd hole was carnage.

The 3rd hole saw J. BAKER lose the Jacket lead whilst PATTERSON recorded a ten for zero points, surrendering the Trophy lead. WILLIAMS now held both. The 4th hole arrived like divine retribution. Williams posted a catastrophic nine for zero points, losing both leads simultaneously. BAKER (Jon) took the Jacket. PATTERSON seized the Trophy. Four holes played, sixteen lead changes recorded. This was golf as parliamentary procedure, every decision immediately reversed.

PATTERSON survived a blow-up at the 7th. By the 9th, WILLIAMS had regained the Trophy lead. By the 10th, he'd lost it again. The leaderboard resembled a stock market in free fall. Then came holes 12 and 13, where Williams recorded an eight and an eleven. Ten strokes combined, zero points collected, tournament hopes extinguished. This was the death of hope filmed in real time.

J. BAKER collected a birdie at the 12th. PATTERSON responded with another at the 15th as part of a holes 12-17 stretch yielding 19 points. He emerged with the Trophy lead by eight points. WILLIAMS had fallen to second. The chaos had selected its victor through process of elimination.

BAKER led the Jacket by six strokes. MULLIN languished in sixth in Stableford despite sitting second in Gross. The scoring systems had achieved complete philosophical divergence.

## Round 4: Consolidation and Course Records {.round4 .round}

Back at the Stadium, PATTERSON opened with a seven for one point. This was metronomic consistency meeting reality. He collected four points at the 2nd and 5th, then a seven again at the 9th. Final tally: 40 points, extending his lead to ten. Victory achieved through paperwork.

J. BAKER posted 35 points and +17 Gross, setting the course record at 89. This represented peak BAKER, occurring after the tournament had been decided. He secured the Green Jacket by eight strokes whilst finishing fourth in Stableford. The systems had measured different sports and reached opposite conclusions.

NEUMANN recorded the tournament's only eagle at the 15th, part of a back-nine surge producing 23 points. Too late. Too little. Too mathematically elegant to matter. His front nine yielded seventeen points. The timing remained criminally wrong. Alex BAKER matched PATTERSON's 40 points to tie the round lead, which felt like participation trophy rather than achievement.

MULLIN authored a Round 4 that defied description. Six points across holes 2-7, including blow-ups at the 3rd and 4th. Then birdies at the 12th and 14th for eleven points across three holes. He finished with 34 points and +20 Gross, securing the Wooden Spoon whilst posting the second-best Gross total. This was golf as philosophical paradox, achievement and failure occupying the same scorecard simultaneously.

PATTERSON cruised home. WILLIAMS posted 38 points for second. NEUMANN and A. BAKER tied the round lead at 40 points each. Nobody cared. The tournament had ended at WILLIAMS's catastrophic 12th-13th in Round 3. What followed was simply documentation.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

John PATTERSON claimed his second Trophy through the sort of metronomic consistency that makes excellent bureaucracy but terrible television. Gross scores of 96-96-95-97 represented either remarkable steadiness or complete inability to improve. His standard deviation of 0.82 across rounds was matched only by his six Stableford zeros. He led the tournament for 48 of 72 holes despite catastrophic blow-ups at H4 R1, H15 R2, and H3 R3. This was victory through survival, not excellence.

Jon BAKER secured his second Green Jacket wire-to-wire, leading 58 of 72 holes. His eight-stroke margin represented dominance. His fourth-place Stableford finish represented philosophical confusion about what golf actually measures. He set the Stadium course record at 89 in Round 4, proof that excellence arrived fashionably late.

The tournament turned at holes 12-13 of Round 3, where Gregg WILLIAMS recorded ten strokes for zero points. This was golf as Greek tragedy, assuming the Greeks measured suffering in Stableford. Williams had held both leads after Round 2. By the 13th hole of Round 3, he'd lost both permanently. The tournament selected its victor through WILLIAMS's elimination rather than PATTERSON's coronation.

David MULLIN collected his third Wooden Spoon whilst posting the second-best Gross score, finishing 23 points behind fifth place in Stableford. This defied every known law of competitive logic. His Round 4 roller coaster (six points holes 2-7, then eleven points 12-14) summarized a tournament where achievement and disaster occupied the same scorecard. Stuart NEUMANN's eagle at H15 R4 punctuated a back-nine surge that came exactly one round too late. Alex BAKER tied the final round lead after spending most of the tournament contemplating existential questions at the bottom of the leaderboard.

What remained was 172 points for PATTERSON, a ten-point margin, and the knowledge that golf tournaments are won not through brilliance but through making fewer catastrophic errors than the opposition. Metronomic consistency conquered chaos. The mathematics supported the result even if the narrative resisted.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Consistency Paradox:** PATTERSON's gross scores varied by just two strokes (95-97 range, StdDev 0.82) despite posting +96 total. Meanwhile, his Stableford performance ranged from 40-45 points (StdDev 2.45). The scoring systems measured entirely different competitions.

**Lead Changes:** Sixteen lead changes occurred across holes 1-10 of Round 3. PATTERSON took the Trophy lead five times across the tournament. WILLIAMS held it after five different holes. The leaderboard churned like bureaucratic machinery until Williams's H12-13 collapse ended all uncertainty.

**Stableford Zeros:** PATTERSON and NEUMANN each recorded six zeros. PATTERSON won the Trophy. NEUMANN finished third. Zero correlation detected between zeros and failure.

**The MULLIN Paradox:** Second in Gross (+71), sixth in Stableford (139pts), 23 points behind fifth place. His Round 4 featured the tournament's greatest intra-round variance: 0.86 points per hole across H2-7, then 3.67 points per hole across H12-14.

**Front Nine vs Back Nine:** Only two players showed significant splits. Alex BAKER: F9 14pts, B9 23pts in Round 2. David MULLIN: F9 13pts, B9 21pts in Round 4. Both came far too late to matter. NEUMANN's final round split (F9 17pts, B9 23pts) represented peak timing failure.

**Wire-to-Wire Watch:** J. BAKER led the Green Jacket race for 58 of 72 holes (80.6%). His final margin was eight strokes. This represented dominance disguised as inevitability.

**Blow-up Equality:** Every player recorded at least two blow-ups. WILLIAMS's H12-13 R3 sequence (+10 combined) represented peak carnage. PATTERSON's H4 R1 twelve matched NEUMANN's H15 R1 twelve for shared ignominy. Golf distributed suffering with bureaucratic fairness.
