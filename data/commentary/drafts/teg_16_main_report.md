## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Stuart Neumann claimed his first TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance that never looked in doubt, pulling away to a 13-point margin over Gregg Williams. The victory was emphatic. Yet Williams had his own clean sweep, leading the Green Jacket competition from first hole to last, finishing 16 strokes clear with a display of relentless gross scoring excellence. The Lisbon Coast courses, stretched across four layouts from Oitavos Dunes to Estoril, proved brutally unforgiving: not a single eagle was recorded across 360 holes, with just ten birdies shared among five players.

This was the first time since TEG 12 that the Trophy and Jacket winners diverged, underlining two distinct stories of dominance. Neumann's Stableford consistency saw him extend his lead from five points to 13 across four rounds. Williams could not convert his gross mastery into Trophy success, finishing as runner-up. At the other end, Alex Baker endured a nightmare week, carding 13 zero-point holes and claiming his third career Wooden Spoon.

## Round 1: Neumann Seizes Control at Oitavos {.round1 .round}

Oitavos Dunes, Portugal's premier links course, set a stern opening test along the rugged Atlantic coast. Neumann took the Trophy lead at the first hole and never relinquished it. Williams and Jon Baker shared the Jacket lead on level terms at the same opening hole, but Neumann's 39 points put him five clear in the Stableford race.

The round was scarred by a catalogue of blow-ups. Alex Baker suffered five in total, including a horrific ten at the 17th (par four) that yielded no points. His card read like a horror show: a nine at the opening hole, another at the seventh, and yet another at the 11th before the 17th calamity. The 18th brought further pain with a seven, as did similar scores for David Mullin, Jon Baker, and Neumann himself. The 18th proved a graveyard for Stableford points, with three players recording no score.

Williams and Jon Baker both posted 34 points to share second place, five back. Williams's 18 over par secured him the Jacket lead by three strokes from Jon Baker on 21 over. Mullin, despite his own struggles with blow-ups at the eighth and tenth, managed 33 points. Alex Baker's 29 points left him bottom of both competitions, 13 points adrift in the Spoon race already.

## Round 2: Solid Extension at Troia {.round2 .round}

Troia's prestigious Robert Trent Jones Sr. design offered a different strategic challenge on the peninsula. Neumann extended his Trophy lead to seven points with a composed 35-point round, holding his nerve despite intermittent struggles.

The first nine holes saw three players find rare birdies on the tenth (par four): Neumann, Jon Baker, and Alex Baker all carded threes. Neumann capitalised, stringing together 11 points across holes ten to twelve to establish control. Jon Baker briefly seized the Jacket lead at the 11th but lost it at the 12th, regained it at the 14th, then surrendered it for good at the 16th. Williams played steadily to retain the Jacket lead despite a modest 30-point round.

The back nine proved treacherous. Neumann suffered three blow-ups in his final six holes, including an eight at the 16th (par four). Jon Baker recorded three of his own, including an eight at the seventh and sixes at the 17th. Yet Neumann's earlier surge provided enough cushion. His round of 35 points kept him comfortably ahead of Mullin's 34 and Jon Baker's 32.

Williams's 30-point round was his lowest of the tournament but his gross scoring remained rock-solid at 22 over, matching Mullin. Neumann's seven-point advantage looked commanding. Alex Baker's 32 points offered brief respite, but his 34 over par kept him rooted to the bottom of the Jacket race.

## Round 3: Breakaway at Penha Longa {.round3 .round}

Penha Longa's mountain terrain and steep gradients proved the tournament's defining crucible. Neumann fired 39 points to stretch his Trophy lead to 12, effectively ending the competition with a round to play.

Williams produced the day's standout performance, carding 37 points and a 15 over par gross score that tightened his grip on the Jacket. His birdie at the fifth (par three) set the tone. He played the back nine superbly, dropping just one over par across six consecutive holes from the tenth to the fifteenth. That consistency kept him five points ahead of Neumann in the Trophy race, though the margin in gross terms was widening decisively.

The round will be remembered for carnage at the 12th (par five). Jon Baker posted a quintuple bogey ten, failing to register a point. Alex Baker joined him with a nine. Both followed with further blow-ups at the 13th. Jon Baker's eight and Alex Baker's seven underlined a wretched stretch: between the 11th and 13th, Jon Baker accrued just one point, Alex Baker managed the same. Neumann and Mullin also suffered blow-ups at the 14th, but the damage was contained.

Neumann's 39 points gave him 113 overall, 12 clear of Williams on 101. Mullin's 30 points left him third on 97. Jon Baker's collapse dropped him to 99, while Alex Baker's 33 points kept him last on 94. Williams's 15 over par round maintained his 11-stroke Jacket lead.

## Round 4: Mullin's Surge Falls Short at Estoril {.round4 .round}

Estoril, Portugal's first golf club and a shorter parkland test, set the stage for Mullin's final day heroics and Neumann's coronation. Mullin fired the tournament's best round, 45 points and 11 over par, but Neumann's 43-point reply ensured a comfortable 13-point Trophy margin.

Neumann's birdie at the second (par three) extended his lead early, earning five Stableford points. Mullin responded with birdies of his own at the second and seventh, the latter a key moment in his charge. Neumann wobbled with a nine at the eighth, registering no points, but steadied immediately with four points at the 12th. Jon Baker's blow-up at the ninth and another at the 11th ended any lingering hopes, though his birdie at the tenth (par five) provided brief encouragement.

Williams cruised home with a 42-point round and 11 over par gross, matching Mullin's score to seal his second Green Jacket by 16 strokes. His only blemish was an eight at the 14th, a rare mistake in an otherwise flawless week. Jon Baker's 32 points and Alex Baker's 33 completed the field.

Alex Baker's round featured the day's worst hole: an 11 at the 12th (par four), yielding no points. Earlier blow-ups at the first and third, plus another at the sixth, ensured his 38 over par round and confirmed a dismal third Wooden Spoon. Yet his back nine offered a modicum of redemption, accruing 20 points compared to 13 on the front.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Stuart Neumann's maiden Trophy triumph was a model of wire-to-wire control, leading from the first hole at Oitavos and never relenting. His 156-point total and 13-point margin over Gregg Williams reflected a combination of consistency and timely recoveries. Neumann never trailed. His ability to post 39 points in both the first and third rounds, bookending a solid 35-point second round, provided the platform. The wobble at Estoril's eighth, a nine that yielded no points, proved inconsequential as his 43-point finale secured the title.

Williams's Green Jacket success was built on relentless gross scoring excellence. His 66 over par final total, 16 strokes better than Mullin in second, underscored a dominance that paralleled Neumann's in Stableford terms. Williams led the Jacket from the first hole and never surrendered it. His third-round 15 over par at Penha Longa was the tournament's defining gross performance, cementing a margin that allowed him to cruise home at Estoril despite finishing as Trophy runner-up.

David Mullin's final-day surge, 45 points and 11 over par, was the tournament's finest individual round but came too late. His 142 points left him one behind Williams in the Trophy race and 16 strokes back in the Jacket. Jon Baker's 131 points and 93 over par placed him fourth in both competitions, his campaign undermined by the quintuple bogey at Penha Longa's 12th.

Alex Baker's nightmare week featured 13 zero-point holes and 22 scores worse than double bogey. His third Wooden Spoon, 29 points behind Jon Baker, capped a tournament he will want to forget. The scarcity of birdies, just ten across 360 holes, and the absence of a single eagle underlined the brutal conditions. Two competitions, two wire-to-wire winners, and one emphatic coronation for Stuart Neumann.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Stuart Neumann (1st, Trophy):** Claimed his first TEG Trophy with wire-to-wire authority, leading from the opening hole and never surrendering the advantage. His 156-point total and 13-point margin over Williams reflected consistency across four rounds, posting 39 points in both the first and third to establish control. Fourth in the Green Jacket at 105 over par.

**Gregg Williams (2nd, Trophy / 1st, Jacket):** Secured his second Green Jacket with relentless gross scoring, leading all 72 holes and finishing 16 strokes clear. His 143-point Trophy total left him runner-up to Neumann, underlining a rare divergence between Stableford excellence and gross dominance. His third-round 15 over par at Penha Longa was the tournament's standout gross performance.

**David Mullin (3rd):** Mounted a late charge with the tournament's best round, 45 points and 11 over par at Estoril, but could not overcome Neumann's commanding lead. Finished one point behind Williams in the Trophy race at 142 points and second in the Jacket at 82 over par. His birdies at the second and seventh on the final day offered a glimpse of what might have been.

**Jon Baker (4th):** Struggled to sustain early momentum, finishing fourth in both competitions with 131 points and 93 over par. His quintuple bogey at Penha Longa's 12th, a ten that yielded no points, epitomised a week of intermittent blow-ups. His birdie at Troia's tenth and another at Estoril provided rare highlights.

**Alex Baker (5th, Wooden Spoon):** Endured a nightmare week, claiming his third career Wooden Spoon with 127 points and 148 over par. Recorded 13 zero-point holes and 22 scores worse than double bogey, including a ten at Oitavos's 17th and an 11 at Estoril's 12th. Finished 29 points behind Jon Baker, a margin that told its own story.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

The tournament's scarcity of scoring was unprecedented: not a single eagle across 360 holes, with just ten birdies shared among five players. Neumann's wire-to-wire Trophy dominance matched Williams's equivalent Jacket control, marking the first time since TEG 12 that the Trophy and Jacket winners diverged. Neumann led for all 72 holes in the Stableford competition, never trailing once after seizing control at Oitavos's first.

Williams's 16-stroke Jacket margin ranks as the second-largest in TEG history for the Green Jacket at the Lisbon Coast. Mullin's final-round 45 points and 11 over par was the tournament's best individual round in both competitions, though it arrived too late to challenge for silverware. Alex Baker's 13 zero-point holes and 22 scores worse than double bogey were the tournament's most, underlining a week of relentless struggle.

A total of 66 blow-ups (triple bogey or worse) were recorded across five players, a figure that reflected the unforgiving nature of the Lisbon Coast layouts. Neumann's victory margin of 13 points was the widest since TEG 14, while Williams's gross dominance was built on remarkably steady play: his worst round was 30 over par at Troia, but his consistency across the other three rounds proved decisive.
