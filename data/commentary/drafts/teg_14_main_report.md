## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

David Mullin claimed his third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket with a defensive masterclass across Kent's unforgiving links, surviving Alex Baker's ferocious final-round assault to win by just two points. The formidable championship test of Royal Cinque Ports greeted the field on day one, setting a brutal tone. Mullin led from the first hole and never trailed across 72 holes, yet found himself clinging to a slender advantage as Baker's tournament-best 43 points in Round 4 closed what had been a nine-point gap. The margins told contrasting stories. Mullin's 154-point Stableford total edged Baker by the narrowest margin of the week, whilst his seven-stroke triumph over Jon Baker in the Jacket felt more emphatic.

Jon Baker endured a tournament of extreme contradictions, securing second place in the Gross competition with five birdies yet claiming the Wooden Spoon with 125 points. Every player recorded a catastrophic blow-up of eight or more, with Baker alone suffering five such collapses.

## Round 1: Royal Cinque Ports Carnage {.round1 .round}

Royal Cinque Ports unleashed its full fury on the opening day. The championship links, which hosted two Open Championships, lived up to its reputation as one of Kent's sternest tests. What lay ahead would prove equally unforgiving.

Alex Baker and David Mullin shared the early co-lead in both competitions after the opening hole. The partnership lasted mere minutes. Gregg Williams recorded a nine at the par-five 3rd, whilst Jon Baker opened with an eight at the same hole. Baker's nightmare start continued at the 5th, where another eight left him languishing at the foot of the Stableford standings by the 4th hole. Mullin briefly surrendered his Jacket lead with a seven at the 7th, only to retake it three holes later with a birdie at the 10th. Alex Baker's challenge imploded spectacularly over the closing stretch. An eight at the 11th cost him the Jacket lead. A ten at the 16th, the day's most catastrophic blow-up, ended his Trophy challenge. A seven at the 18th completed a miserable finish.

Mullin's 40-point round established a three-point cushion over Alex Baker, with Williams three points further back. The Jacket standings mirrored the Trophy hierarchy, Mullin's 15-over-par total giving him a five-stroke advantage. Jon Baker sat second in the Gross despite his disastrous opening Stableford showing.

## Round 2: Mullin Extends Authority {.round2 .round}

Littlestone Golf Club, the remote links on Romney Marshes refined by Braid and MacKenzie, awaited on day two. Mullin needed to press his advantage. His rivals hoped the change of venue might spark a revival.

Mullin delivered the round's defining performance with 41 points, featuring birdies at the 7th and 18th holes. His only blemish came at the 4th, where a seven yielded no points. Alex Baker endured a wretched front nine. A seven at the 2nd preceded a nine at the 5th and an eight at the 8th, leaving him 14 points adrift by the turn. Four blow-ups in the round left Baker's challenge in tatters. Williams fared little better, collecting four zero-point holes including catastrophic numbers at the 5th and 18th. Jon Baker's solitary blow-up at the 7th represented relative restraint by TEG 14 standards. The back nine offered marginal respite, Baker and Mullin both scoring seven points better than their outward efforts.

Mullin's commanding position grew more imposing. His 81-point halfway total gave him a nine-point cushion over Alex Baker in the Trophy, whilst his three-stroke Jacket lead over Jon Baker looked increasingly secure. Williams trailed by 15 points in third.

## Round 3: Williams Strikes, Mullin Holds {.round3 .round}

Prince's Golf Club, pairing the coastal Shore nine with the Dunes nine, provided the venue for the final two rounds. The classic combination represented the strongest routing at Prince's. Mullin's leads appeared substantial, yet TEG's volatility left everything uncertain.

Gregg Williams produced the day's finest Stableford performance with 39 points, the tournament's best round for Trophy contenders. His 14-over-par gross score, featuring three straight pars from the 9th, slashed Mullin's Jacket advantage from 18 strokes to 12. Mullin wobbled alarmingly with blow-ups at the 2nd, 7th, and a nine at the 8th. His closing birdie at the 18th salvaged a 36-point round, yet his once-commanding leads had narrowed. Alex Baker's 37 points moved him into second place, just eight points behind. Jon Baker struggled through five blow-ups, including catastrophic numbers at the 11th and 13th during a mid-round collapse that yielded seven over par for those three holes.

Mullin retained his Trophy lead by eight points over Alex Baker, with Williams surging to third. The Jacket race tightened to 12 strokes over Williams, with Jon Baker languishing fourth in the Stableford despite sitting second in Gross.

## Round 4: Baker's Heroic Failure {.round4 .round}

The Shore and Dunes combination awaited for the final showdown. Mullin's eight-point Trophy cushion appeared safe. Alex Baker had other ideas.

Baker launched a ferocious assault, opening with four points at the 1st. He added four more at the 7th and further gains at the 13th and 14th. His front nine yielded 24 points, the tournament's strongest opening half. Mullin's challenge faltered midway through, an eight at the 10th his worst blow-up of the round. Jon Baker produced a birdie blitz across the middle section, collecting four in seven holes including three straight from the 6th. His 11-over-par gross represented the day's best score, securing second place in the Jacket with seven strokes to spare. Baker's Stableford round fell apart over the closing stretch. A six at the 16th preceded the day's defining moment: an eight at the 18th that ended any lingering Trophy hopes. Alex Baker maintained his blistering pace until the 16th. A catastrophic ten halted his charge. His 43-point round fell agonisingly short.

Mullin's 37 points proved just enough. His 154-point total edged Baker by two points in the closest Trophy finish of the tournament. The seven-stroke Jacket margin over Jon Baker felt comfortable by comparison. Baker's five birdies earned him the Wooden Spoon.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

David Mullin's dual triumph represented triumph through consistency rather than brilliance. His standard deviation of 2.94 in gross scoring proved the steadiest in the field, despite collecting six zero-point holes across the week. Four birdies paled against Jon Baker's five, yet Mullin never trailed after Round 1 in either competition. The narrowing margins told the real story. A nine-point Trophy cushion after Round 2 shrank to eight after Round 3, then to just two by the final hole. Alex Baker's 43-point final round, featuring 24 points on the front nine alone, represented the tournament's finest Stableford performance and very nearly stole the title.

Jon Baker's contradictory week defied logic. His 75-over-par total secured second place in the Jacket by a single stroke over Williams, yet his 125 Stableford points left him 29 behind third place. Five birdies led the field. Eleven zero-point holes earned him the Wooden Spoon. The 29-point gap between second and fourth in the Trophy underlined how close the battle for runner-up honours had been, even as Mullin maintained his distance at the summit.

Every player recorded at least one catastrophic collapse of eight or more. Baker's ten at the 16th in Round 4 represented the week's worst single-hole meltdown, yet Williams' nine at the 3rd in Round 1 and Mullin's nine at the 8th in Round 3 ran it close. TEG 14 confirmed its status as championship golf at its most unforgiving. Mullin survived where others crumbled.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**David Mullin (Winner, Trophy & Jacket):** Led from the opening hole and never surrendered either competition, despite Alex Baker's ferocious final-round assault closing the Trophy margin to two points. Four birdies and superior consistency across 72 holes proved decisive.

**Alex Baker (2nd, Trophy):** His tournament-best 43 points in Round 4 fell agonisingly short, the catastrophic ten at the 16th ending his charge. Collected no birdies all week yet came within two points of stealing the Trophy.

**Gregg Williams (3rd, Trophy & Jacket):** His 39-point Round 3 represented the finest Stableford performance by a Trophy contender and briefly threatened Mullin's Jacket lead. Finished third in both competitions, seven strokes behind Jon Baker in Gross.

**Jon Baker (Wooden Spoon, 2nd Jacket):** Led the field with five birdies yet claimed the Wooden Spoon, his 125 points trailing third place by 29. Secured second in the Jacket by a single stroke despite eleven zero-point holes.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

David Mullin's 154 Stableford points rank as the second-highest Trophy total in TEG history at Kent venues, bettered only by his own 157 at TEG 13. His 68-over-par gross score represented the steadiest performance across the week, with a standard deviation less than three strokes. Alex Baker's 43-point Round 4 matched the tournament's single-round Stableford record for any TEG event in Kent. Jon Baker's remarkable split between Gross and Stableford competitions has no precedent in TEG history: finishing second in one competition whilst simultaneously claiming the Wooden Spoon represents the widest performance gap ever recorded. The combined 360 holes produced 33 zero-point scores across all players, an average of more than eight apiece. Every competitor recorded at least one catastrophic blow-up of eight or higher, confirming TEG 14 as one of the most volatile tournaments on record.
