## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

David Mullin claimed his third TEG Trophy and ninth Green Jacket with a performance that somehow combined absolute control and heart-stopping drama. He led for all 72 holes yet finished just two points clear of Alex Baker in the Stableford competition. The margin in Gross was more comfortable at 34 strokes.

Mullin's consistency anchored the victory: four birdies and 23 pars across four rounds, despite six blow-ups that might have derailed a lesser campaign. Alex Baker mounted a heroic final-round charge, posting 43 points to close a nine-point gap to two, but time ran out. The 2021 trek to Kent's formidable links delivered a brutal test. Meanwhile, defending champion Jon Baker suffered a catastrophic collapse from contention to his first career Wooden Spoon, punctuated by eleven zero-point holes and a tournament littered with 28 triple bogeys or worse across the field.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos on the Channel Coast {.round1 .round}

Royal Cinque Ports, that formidable championship links at Deal, set the tone immediately. Both competitions remained wide open through the early holes. Alex Baker and Mullin shared the lead at the first hole with level-par fours.

The round quickly turned chaotic. Gregg Williams found nine at the par-five third for no points. Jon Baker followed with his own blow-up at the same hole, then added another at the fifth. Alex Baker, who had led briefly, imploded spectacularly late: a ten at the par-five 16th cost him the Trophy lead, then a seven at the last compounded the damage. Mullin seized control at the 16th with a regulation five-pointer and never looked back. His only blemish came at the seventh, a triple-bogey seven that briefly cost him the Jacket lead. A birdie at the tenth steadied the ship.

Mullin closed with 40 points to lead by three. His gross tally of 15 over gave him a five-stroke Jacket advantage. Alex Baker sat second on 37 points despite three blow-ups. Williams claimed third on 33. Jon Baker, hampered by two early disasters, languished fourth on 29.

## Round 2: Mullin Extends, Field Fractures {.round2 .round}

The field moved to Littlestone, the classic remote links designed by the same architect who shaped Royal St George's. Mullin faced early pressure but answered emphatically. His birdie at the par-five seventh kept the chasers at bay.

Alex Baker's challenge unravelled on a nightmare stretch from the third through the eighth. He played those six holes at fourteen over par, including blow-ups at the fifth and eighth. Mullin stayed level through the middle holes, then closed with a birdie at the par-five 18th to post 41 points. The margin ballooned to nine. Williams battled four blow-ups to scrape 27 points. Jon Baker managed 29 despite his own meltdown at the seventh.

Mullin's Jacket lead stretched to twelve strokes over Jon Baker. The defending champion sat 21 points behind in the Trophy. Alex Baker held second but had drifted to 37 behind. The picture looked increasingly one-sided.

## Round 3: Blow-Up Fest on the Shore and Dunes {.round3 .round}

Prince's Golf Club hosted the weekend, pairing the coastal Shore nine with the Dunes for what is considered the strongest routing at the Sandwich venue. The conditions delivered carnage. Eleven triple bogeys or worse scarred the leaderboard.

Mullin found immediate trouble with an eight at the par-five second. He compounded it with back-to-back blow-ups at the seventh and eighth, playing those two holes at seven over. Jon Baker briefly flickered with a birdie at the second but then posted five zero-point holes, including quadruple-bogeys at the fourth, sixth and 13th. The defending champion was disintegrating. Alex Baker suffered his own horrors at the tenth and 16th. Williams navigated the chaos best, posting 39 points to win the round.

Mullin steadied with three pars from the 15th, then closed with a birdie at the last to salvage 36 points. His Trophy lead shrank to eight points over Alex Baker. The Jacket margin ballooned to 31 strokes as Jon Baker's Gross round collapsed. The tournament remained Mullin's to lose, but the margin felt narrower than the standings suggested.

## Round 4: Baker's Charge, Mullin Holds Firm {.round4 .round}

The final round returned to Prince's Shore and Dunes with Mullin defending an eight-point Trophy cushion. Alex Baker opened brilliantly, posting 24 points on the front nine. Jon Baker, playing for pride, fired four birdies and set a new course record with 83 gross.

The tension peaked on the back nine. Alex Baker raced through the 13th and 14th with consecutive four-pointers, trimming Mullin's lead with every hole. Then came the catastrophic 16th. Baker found ten at the par-four for no points. His charge collapsed. Mullin, who had found his own blow-up at the tenth, held steady enough. Jon Baker's record-breaking round included a triple-bogey at the 16th and a quadruple-bogey finish at the 18thâ€”the Spoon battle was already settled.

Mullin posted 37 points, his lowest round but enough. Alex Baker's heroic 43 closed the gap to two points but no further. The Trophy was Mullin's. Williams claimed third with 38. Jon Baker's 39-point rally secured the round but left him rooted to the Wooden Spoon. The defending champion had fallen all the way.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Mullin's third Trophy and ninth Jacket arrived via the narrowest of Stableford margins and the most comfortable of Gross victories. He led after every round in both competitions yet needed all 72 holes to fend off Alex Baker's relentless pursuit. The final two-point cushion belied the tension: Baker closed from nine behind to two with a magnificent 43-point finale, only to see his campaign shattered by a ten at the 16th.

Mullin's formula combined four birdies, 23 pars and six blow-ups that somehow failed to derail him. His 68 over par in Gross left no doubt about the Jacket, a 34-stroke margin that underscored his superiority in the secondary competition. Williams finished a solid third in both. His 39-point third round kept him in contention, though he never truly threatened Mullin's lead.

The tournament's darkest subplot belonged to Jon Baker. The defending champion's collapse from contender to first career Wooden Spoon came via eleven zero-point holes and five birdies that arrived too late to matter. His final-round course record of 83 at Prince's Shore and Dunes served as a poignant reminder of what might have been. The 2021 Kent odyssey concluded with Mullin triumphant, Baker heroic in defeat, and a defending champion left to contemplate the cruelty of links golf.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**David Mullin (1st):** Swept both competitions with his third Trophy and ninth Jacket. Led for all 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in Gross, posting four birdies and 23 pars. Six blow-ups tested his nerve but never dislodged him. Finished two points clear in the Trophy, 34 strokes ahead in the Jacket.

**Alex Baker (2nd):** Mounted a heroic final-round charge that fell two points short. Posted a tournament-best 43 points in Round 4 to close a nine-point gap, but a catastrophic ten at the 16th par-four ended his hopes. Finished with 22 pars and no birdies across 72 holes, nine blow-ups scattering his scorecard.

**Gregg Williams (3rd):** Claimed third in both competitions with steady if unspectacular golf. Posted the best round of the third day with 39 points, navigating the blow-up epidemic better than most. Seven disasters across the tournament kept him from challenging the leaders. Finished 17 points behind Mullin in the Trophy.

**Jon Baker (4th):** Defending champion suffered his first career Wooden Spoon after a catastrophic collapse. Posted eleven zero-point holes including five in Round 3 alone. Rallied with five birdies including four in the final round, setting a Prince's Shore and Dunes course record of 83 gross. The record provided small consolation for a nightmare week.
