# TEG 17: Jon Baker's Fourth Double and John Patterson's 22-Point Memory Loss {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 17 | Lisbon Coast | 2024</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker won both the Trophy and Green Jacket by margins so absurd they suggest either genius or everyone else experiencing simultaneous cognitive failure. Eighteen points. Thirteen strokes. He led for 67 of 72 holes in one competition and 70 of 72 in the other, which is less a golf tournament and more a four-day demonstration of the concept of inevitability. This occurred across four Portuguese courses where the primary drama involved John Patterson's Round 2 meltdown: a 22-point performance featuring eight zero-point holes and nine triple-bogeys-plus, which is less a golf round and more a cry for help set to the sound of expensive equipment meeting turf at inadvisable velocities.

David Mullin posted the tournament's best round, a magnificent 47-point masterpiece in Round 2, which had roughly the same effect on the outcome as rearranging deckchairs. Gregg Williams began by co-leading the Jacket, then claimed the Wooden Spoon, proving that golf is a game where you can experience the full arc of human experience in 72 holes.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (Winner, Trophy and Jacket):** Seized both leads in Round 2 and never relinquished them, which is the golfing equivalent of deciding a marathon by the first mile. His wire-to-wire dominance was so complete that calling it a "competition" feels generous. Four trophies, four jackets, and the serene confidence of a man who knows he's better at Stableford than you are at breathing.

**David MULLIN (2nd, both competitions):** Posted a 47-point Round 2 that should have won something, but instead functioned as expensive therapy. Finished second in both competitions by 18 points and 13 strokes, which is the golfing equivalent of showing up with a PowerPoint presentation to a knife fight. Played beautiful, consistent golf that nobody will remember because Jon Baker exists.

**John PATTERSON (Tied 3rd, Trophy):** Led after Round 1, then experienced what clinical psychology would classify as "a complete unraveling." His Round 2 featured eight zero-point holes and a gross score that set an all-time TEG worst. Rebounded with a 41-point Round 3, proving golf is a game where yesterday's catastrophe becomes tomorrow's amusing anecdote, assuming you possess the psychological resilience of a Special Forces operative.

**Alex BAKER (Tied 3rd, Trophy):** Four rounds between 32 and 37 points, which is the golfing equivalent of steady employment in a gig economy. Finished 31 points behind his brother, proving that genetics explains some things but not the important ones. His consistency was admirable, his proximity to victory non-existent.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (Wooden Spoon):** Co-led the Jacket after Round 1, then spent three rounds demonstrating the fragility of hope. Finished 43 points behind in the Trophy, which is less a margin and more a philosophical statement about the distance between ambition and reality.

## Round 1: The Brief Democracy of Optimism {.round1 .round}

Praia D'El Rey offered its peculiar mixture of links and parkland, which is Portuguese for "you'll need two different swings and we're not telling you when." By the third hole, three players had held the Jacket lead. This democratic phase lasted approximately four more holes before reality reasserted its preference for hierarchy.

John Patterson arrived at the turn with 16 points, which felt less like a score and more like a promissory note. The back nine delivered 23 points, featuring a birdie on the 12th and a succession of four-point holes that suggested either divine intervention or John finally remembering how the game works. By the 16th, he'd taken the Trophy lead. Gregg Williams seized the Jacket lead at the 17th. For approximately 90 minutes, hope was distributed democratically.

Jon Baker posted 38 points despite blow-ups on the 10th and 17th. This is the golfing equivalent of stumbling twice during a sprint and still winning by a photo finish. David Mullin opened with three blow-ups in six holes, then posted 23 points on the back nine, which is golf's version of remembering you're good at this halfway through the exam. Alex Baker experienced five blow-ups on the front nine alone, a performance that would make Vesuvius feel inadequate.

The round ended with Patterson leading by a single point, Williams and Baker tied for the Jacket, and the general feeling that tomorrow would clarify everything. Tomorrow clarified everything.

## Round 2: A Comprehensive Study in Numerical Cruelty {.round2 .round}

West Cliffs, Cynthia Dye's award-winning links, hosted what will henceforth be known as "The Patterson Incident." Jon Baker took the Trophy lead on the first hole. Patterson surrendered it with a seven. What followed was less a golf round and more a systematic exploration of how many ways one can score zero points on a single hole.

Patterson's scorecard read like a hostage note written by someone who'd lost count: blow-ups on the first, third, sixth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh. Then a catastrophic ten on the 13th. Then an eleven on the 15th. Eight zero-point holes. Nine triple-bogeys or worse. A gross score of 44 that established a new all-time TEG worst, which is the sort of record nobody wants but everybody remembers. His 22 Stableford points represented the difference between playing golf and experiencing golf as cosmic punishment.

Meanwhile, David Mullin posted 47 points, featuring birdies on the ninth, tenth, and 15th. It was a round that deserved its own documentary. Instead, it functioned as background noise to Patterson's public disassembly. Jon Baker posted 44 points with a birdie on the fourth, took both leads, and watched as the tournament transformed from competition to coronation procession.

The round ended with Baker leading by two points, Patterson 15 points back despite leading 24 hours earlier, and the general sense that some golf rounds function as warnings from the universe about the futility of ambition.

## Round 3: The Confirmation of Hierarchy {.round3 .round}

Royal Óbidos, Seve Ballesteros's final design, offered dramatic water features and championship-level brutality. Jon Baker responded by extending his leads to eleven points and eight strokes, which is golf's way of saying "we can skip the last round if you'd prefer."

Baker opened with a blow-up on the first, briefly surrendered the Jacket lead, then reclaimed it on the second hole and never looked back. His birdies on the 11th and 13th were less golf shots and more administrative tasks: confirming what everyone already knew. His 44-point round established a new course record, which feels like showing off but was probably just muscle memory at this point.

Patterson posted 41 points, featuring a birdie on the eighth, proving that golf is a game where yesterday's mathematical hate crime becomes today's redemption arc. David Mullin managed 35 points but couldn't gain ground, which is the golfing equivalent of running in place on a treadmill while someone else sprints past you in the real world.

Gregg Williams fell to last in the Trophy with 26 points, a performance that included a birdie on the 11th followed by blow-ups that suggested golf is less a game of skill and more a game of not actively sabotaging yourself. Alex Baker's 34 points were marred by a catastrophic ten on the 14th, proving that even consistency has its limits when the course decides otherwise.

## Round 4: The Ceremonial Confirmation of Inevitability {.round4 .round}

Praia D'El Rey for the second time, which by now felt less like a golf course and more like a venue for watching Jon Baker add 18 more points to an already insurmountable lead. He posted 40 points with birdies on the fourth and fifth, then blow-ups on the seventh, tenth, and 17th that mattered approximately as much as rearranging furniture during a house fire.

David Mullin managed 33 points but finished 18 points behind in the Trophy and 13 strokes behind in the Jacket, which is the sort of margin that transforms "second place" into "distant observer." Patterson posted 33 points but his back nine collapse—12 points after posting 21 on the front—suggested that golf remains a game where hope arrives early and departs on schedule.

Alex Baker's 32 points featured six blow-ups across 18 holes, which is less a golf round and more a comprehensive survey of ways to transform promising positions into statistical regret. Gregg Williams closed with 29 points, securing the Spoon with the inevitability of gravity.

The tournament ended with Baker's 166 points and plus-67 gross representing not just victory but a systematic demonstration that some players operate on different mathematical principles than the rest of humanity. His dominance was so complete that calling it "dominance" feels like understatement. He won. Everyone else participated.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's fourth Trophy and fourth Jacket arrived with the inevitability of continental drift. He led for 67 of 72 holes in the Trophy and 70 of 72 in the Jacket, which is less a competition and more a four-day tutorial on the concept of sustained excellence. His 18-point margin in the Trophy and 13-stroke margin in the Jacket represent the sort of dominance that makes second place feel like a participation award.

David Mullin's tournament-best 47-point Round 2 should have meant something. Instead, it functioned as expensive proof that posting brilliant rounds in isolation achieves approximately the same outcome as not posting them at all. His second-place finish in both competitions was the golfing equivalent of writing a brilliant essay that nobody reads because someone else already solved the problem.

John Patterson's Round 2 collapse—22 points, eight zero-point holes, an all-time TEG worst gross score—will be remembered long after his Round 1 lead is forgotten. This is golf's particular cruelty: your disasters define you more than your achievements. His 41-point Round 3 rebound proved that golf is a game where today's catastrophe becomes tomorrow's amusing anecdote, assuming you possess the psychological resilience of a professional stuntman.

Alex Baker's consistency yielded tied-third in the Trophy, 31 points behind his brother. Gregg Williams co-led the Jacket after Round 1, then claimed the Spoon, which is golf's way of demonstrating that hope and reality maintain separate postal addresses. The tournament ended with zero lead changes after Round 2, which is rare enough to note and boring enough to prove that dominance, while impressive, makes for tedious spectacle.

## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}

**All-Time TEG Worsts:**
- John Patterson: +44 gross (Round 2) — 325th of 325 rounds, which is the sort of ranking that suggests the record will survive longer than most marriages

**Personal Worsts:**
- John Patterson: +44 gross (Round 2) — 26th of 26 rounds, proving that some achievements are better left unachieved

**Course Records:**
- Royal Óbidos: Jon Baker, 86 gross (Round 3, TEG 17) — a new standard for a course that presumably expected better resistance

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Most Consistent Player:** Alex Baker (variance: 2.5 points across four rounds), which is the golfing equivalent of steady employment in uncertain times. His 32-37 point range yielded third place and proof that consistency without brilliance achieves proximity to mediocrity.

**Biggest Round-to-Round Swing:** John Patterson (Round 1-2: minus-17 points), which represents the sort of statistical violence that requires new categories of measurement. From leading by one point to 22-point implosion is the golfing equivalent of falling down an elevator shaft while holding a trophy.

**Lead Stability:** Jon Baker led for 67 consecutive holes after Round 2 (Trophy) and 70 of 72 total holes (Jacket), which is dominance so complete it transforms competition into coronation. Zero lead changes after Round 2 represents the sort of competitive narrative arc that makes highlight reels unnecessary.

**Course Scoring:** West Cliffs yielded the tournament's best round (David Mullin, 47 points) and worst (John Patterson, 22 points), which is the sort of range that suggests the course functions less as neutral terrain and more as amplifier of existing psychological states. Praia D'El Rey saw Jon Baker post identical 38 and 40-point rounds in Rounds 1 and 4, proving that some players treat consistency as background noise while others treat it as career achievement.
