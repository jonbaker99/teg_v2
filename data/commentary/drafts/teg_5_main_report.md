## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy with a three-point victory over Gregg Williams, reclaiming the lead on the opening hole of the final round and never trailing again despite five lead changes. David Mullin dominated the Green Jacket competition with a 54-stroke margin, leading all 72 holes in gross scoring. Yet Mullin's extraordinary Jacket triumph came paired with the Wooden Spoon, his 136 Stableford points finishing last by three. The Atlantic breezes off Portugal's coast tested every player across Boavista's parkland and Palmares' seaside links. Williams entered Sunday ahead by one but a quintuple bogey at the 16th sealed his collapse.

The tournament split into two distinct narratives. Baker's resilience carried him through wild swings after leading Round 1. Mullin's near-faultless ball-striking contrasted starkly with his Stableford struggles, producing the most extreme divergence between competitions in TEG history.

## Round 1: Baker Edges Ahead Despite Late Blow-Up {.round1 .round}

Jon Baker and David Mullin shared the early lead at Boavista, both carding five and one over on the opening hole. Mullin seized control with birdies at the third and fifth, posting level par through seven holes. Williams endured a horror start with a triple bogey at the first and promptly followed with another at the tenth. Stuart Neumann's round imploded with three big numbers in the final nine holes.

Baker's front nine looked solid until the sixth, where a quintuple bogey dropped him four points behind Mullin. He steadied the ship through the middle stretch. A birdie at the 16th, a par five playing into the prevailing breeze, reclaimed the Trophy lead with two holes remaining. The drama peaked at the 18th. Baker's four-over blow-up cost him zero points, but Mullin and Williams also stumbled on the closing hole. Baker's 40 points held off Mullin by a single point.

Mullin's 12-over gross led the Jacket race by eight strokes despite his 39-point Stableford total. Williams' triple bogeys at the first, tenth, and 18th, plus a quintuple at the 17th, left him five over par but five points behind Baker. Neumann and Hugh Murnin occupied the lower reaches after matching disasters.

## Round 2: Mullin Seizes Lead Amid Eight Lead Changes {.round2 .round}

Baker's hold on the Trophy lasted two holes. A three-over card-wrecker at the second dropped him behind. Mullin and Williams traded blows through the opening stretch as the leaderboard churned. The lead changed hands eight times before Mullin's birdie at the eighth, a reachable par five, gave him breathing room. Williams' blow-up at the same hole, a nine that yielded zero points, saw him slip to third.

Neumann produced the round of the tournament. A birdie at the third sparked a run that peaked between the eighth and tenth, where consecutive birdies delivered 11 points from three holes. His career-best 45 points vaulted him from last to fourth overall. Mullin's 40-point effort included a birdie at the eighth and another triple-bogey-free stretch that cemented his Jacket dominance. Baker's 36 points dropped him to third in the Trophy race.

Henry Meller endured the day's worst collapse. Blow-ups at the 14th and 16th, including a quintuple at the latter, yielded just one point from the stretch. An eight at the 18th capped a nightmarish back nine of 11 points. Meller's 30-point round left him nine behind Mullin in the Spoon battle.

Mullin's cumulative 23 over par extended his Jacket lead. Williams' 42-point round moved him to second in the Trophy standings, one behind Mullin's 79-point total. Baker sat third, three points adrift.

## Round 3: Williams Claims Lead After Chaotic Closing Stretch {.round3 .round}

Boavista's parkland layout turned treacherous as blow-ups multiplied. Mullin opened with a birdie at the first but gave it straight back at the second with a three-over nightmare. Williams assumed the Trophy lead at the third with a four-point par five. Baker suffered a five-over meltdown at the seventh that yielded no points. Williams held firm despite blow-ups at the eighth and ninth, both costing him crucial points. Mullin's round unravelled with zeros at the tenth and 13th.

The final three holes delivered chaos. Williams lost the lead at the 17th with a three-over score worth nothing. Baker's two-pointer at the same hole briefly put him ahead. Then the 18th struck. Baker's five-over blow-up dropped him back. Williams reclaimed the Trophy lead with a one-point margin entering the final round.

Neumann's round fell apart with blow-ups at the second, 17th, and 18th. His 32 points kept him in fourth overall. Mullin's personal-worst 27 points, anchored by three zeros in the back nine, dropped him to fourth in the Trophy race. Yet his gross total of 27 over par maintained a commanding Jacket lead. Williams' 37-point round gave him 115 points overall, one ahead of Baker's 114.

Meller's 36 points, the round's steadiest performance, lifted him clear of the Spoon battle. Mullin's cumulative struggles left him in last place by three points.

## Round 4: Baker's Final-Round Surge Seals Comeback Victory {.round4 .round}

Palmares' links-style Praia layout greeted the field for Sunday's finale. Baker reclaimed the Trophy lead at the first with a three-point par. A birdie at the third extended his advantage. Williams responded immediately. A par at the third kept him within range.

The lead swapped five times across the front nine. Baker's quintuple at the fifth, an eight at the par three, handed control back to Williams. Baker struck back at the sixth with a par worth three points while Williams carded a triple bogey. Baker's triple at the eighth gifted the lead back to Williams. The battle raged hole by hole. Neither player could break clear.

Baker's birdies at the 13th, 14th, and 15th proved decisive. Ten points from three holes opened a five-point gap. Williams needed something special. The 16th, a par four, delivered the opposite. A quintuple bogey, nine on the card, yielded zero points. Williams' challenge ended there.

Mullin's back-nine revival, sparked by birdies at the 12th and 13th, lifted him clear of the Spoon. His 30-point round left him last overall but his 72-over gross sealed the Jacket by 54 strokes. Neumann's four triple bogeys limited him to 32 points. Meller carded a career-best 39 points and 17 over par, the round's best gross score.

Baker's back nine produced 22 points, double his front-nine tally. Williams' front nine of 22 points contrasted with a collapse to 16 on the back. Baker's 156-point total won the Trophy by three. Williams finished second on 153. Meller and Neumann tied for third on 139.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's second TEG Trophy came through resilience and timing. He led after the opening round, lost ground across the middle 36 holes, then reclaimed control with a perfectly timed final-round surge. Three birdies between the 13th and 15th secured victory. Gregg Williams entered Sunday ahead by one but his quintuple bogey at the 16th ended any realistic challenge. Williams' five-point deficit became insurmountable with two holes remaining.

David Mullin's fourth Green Jacket arrived with the most extraordinary split between competitions in TEG history. His 72-over gross led every hole except the first of Round 1, a 54-stroke margin that crushed the field. Yet his 136 Stableford points earned the Wooden Spoon by three. Mullin's struggles converting decent ball-striking into points defined his week.

Stuart Neumann's career-best 45 points in Round 2, powered by 11 points between the eighth and tenth, vaulted him into contention. His final-round fade left him tied for third with Henry Meller, who posted a personal-best 39 points on Sunday. Williams' collapse aside, the 72-hole battle saw 44 triple bogeys or worse, an average of more than one disaster every two holes. The Algarve tested every player. Baker proved the most adept at damage limitation when it mattered.
