# TEG 17: Baker Dominates Portugal

Jon Baker claimed his fourth Trophy and fourth Green Jacket with a commanding wire-to-wire performance across four Lisbon Coast venues. Leading for 67 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross, Baker cruised to an 18-point Trophy margin and 13-stroke Jacket victory over David Mullin.

Mullin's tournament-best 47-point Round 2 at West Cliffs proved futile against Baker's relentless consistency. John Patterson's tournament defined Round 2 chaos: leading after Round 1, he imploded spectacularly with 22 points (eight zero-pointers, nine triple-bogeys or worse) before rebounding with back-to-back 40+ point rounds to salvage third. Gregg Williams collected his first Wooden Spoon after co-leading the Jacket following Round 1, finishing 43 points behind.

Baker led unchallenged after Round 2, cruising through Royal Óbidos and Praia D'El Rey to secure the sweep—the only player since TEG's dual-competition format to win both Trophy and Jacket at the same event.
