## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Alex Baker claimed his first TEG Trophy with an 11-point victory at Palmares and Boavista, overturning an eight-point deficit to seize control during a chaotic third round and pulling clear with a superlative final round of 51 points. David Mullin secured his ninth Green Jacket by 12 strokes despite a turbulent Stableford campaign that saw him plummet to fifth in the Trophy standings. The tournament returned to the Algarve for the first time in five years, with two new Palmares layouts joining familiar Boavista terrain.

Baker's redemption arc could scarcely have been more complete: having previously endured Wooden Spoon ignominy, he delivered the steadiest second-half performance of the week to dismantle rivals who faltered under pressure. Mullin led for 68 of 72 holes in the Jacket race yet registered just 162 Stableford points, the worst-ever gap between competitions for a Green Jacket winner. Gregg Williams fought valiantly for both titles, finishing runner-up in each. John Patterson's catastrophic week, featuring 20 zero-point holes across 72, earned him the Spoon by 32 points and 81 strokes.

## Round 1: Mullin's Boavista Masterclass {.round1 .round}

Boavista Golf & Spa Resort made its third TEG appearance under cloudless skies, the parkland layout split into distinct halves framing distant Atlantic views. Mullin and Jon Baker shared the early Jacket lead at level par, but gaps quickly opened as the field scattered across the scoreboard.

Mullin seized control with a mid-round surge that redefined the leaderboard. Birdies at the 13th, 14th and 16th anchored a six-hole stretch played at two under. His 49-point haul, built on impeccable ball-striking rather than heroics, left him eight points clear of Alex Baker in the Trophy standings and joint leader in the Jacket. Gregg Williams carded four points at the par-five 13th but blew up at the 16th and 18th, a nine at the last derailing an otherwise solid 38 points. Alex Baker opened with a seven at the par-three second and a nine at the eighth yet recovered to 41 points, trailing only Mullin. Jon Baker's steady 37 points kept him second in the Jacket.

At the back, Stuart Neumann's round imploded spectacularly. Blow-ups at the third, 15th, 17th and a 10 at the 18th left him 19 points adrift. Patterson fared only marginally better, zero-point holes at the sixth and eighth setting the tone for his week. Both men faced steep climbs.

## Round 2: Williams Closes the Gap {.round2 .round}

The new Palmares Praia-Alvor combination mixed seaside links with parkland, a strategic test under warm coastal breezes. Mullin retained his Trophy lead but saw his cushion shrink to five points. Williams surged into second place, closing the gap with a brilliant 48 points.

Williams opened with a triple bogey but recovered superbly. A birdie at the 10th highlighted a six-hole run yielding 20 points. Jon Baker also flourished early, his birdie at the second sparking a front-nine 27 that vaulted him to second in the Jacket at 10 over. Alex Baker's 45 points, despite a triple at the 18th, kept him within striking distance. Mullin's 42 points felt pedestrian by his standards, a double bogey at the 14th among the blemishes, yet he retained both leads.

Neumann's nightmare continued. Horror holes at the 13th, 14th, 15th and 18th yielded zero points across four holes, a stretch averaging five over per hole. Patterson managed 35 points but posted triples at the first, 10th, 11th and 13th, his cumulative misery mounting. The Spoon race had a runaway leader.

## Round 3: Five-Way Lead Carousel {.round3 .round}

Palmares Alvor-Lagos delivered the tournament's defining drama: a five-player lead battle that swung hole by hole, reshaping the Trophy race and exposing vulnerabilities in every contender. Williams posted the day's best Gross of 87, seizing the Jacket lead at 15 over.

Alex Baker took the Trophy lead at the par-five fourth with four points, then retook it at the sixth. Mullin briefly reclaimed the lead at the seventh. The quintuple-bogey 10 at the 13th cost Baker the lead again. He recovered immediately, retaking it at the 15th. By day's end, Baker and Williams stood level on 141 points. Mullin collapsed to fifth, his 31 points featuring blow-ups at the fourth, ninth, 11th and 13th before late birdies at the 15th and 17th salvaged scraps. An eight at the 18th capped a grim afternoon. His Jacket lead narrowed to five strokes over Williams.

Jon Baker rallied with 20 back-nine points to salvage 35 overall. Neumann's triple at the seventh and subsequent struggles left him in fifth. Patterson endured quintuple bogeys at the eighth and 12th, part of a four-hole stretch averaging four over per hole. His 27 points represented his worst-ever round. The Spoon was his.

## Round 4: Baker's Breakaway Brilliance {.round4 .round}

Boavista returned for the finale. Baker delivered a stunning 51-point masterpiece, an all-time TEG record built on relentless four-point holes rather than birdies, to claim an 11-point victory. Mullin recaptured the Jacket with a birdie at the 16th, his 13-over round securing a 12-stroke margin.

Baker lost the lead briefly at the first when Williams posted a bogey. Williams then birdied the fifth to edge ahead, only to blow up at the sixth. Baker's run from the sixth onwards was merciless: four-point holes at the sixth, seventh and 10th extended his advantage to unassailable proportions. A triple at the 15th barely registered, four more points at the 16th restoring his rhythm. Williams and Jon Baker both carded 40 points but could not threaten, Williams undone by blow-ups at the sixth and 18th.

Mullin's 40 points, anchored by his birdie at the 16th, overtook Williams in the Jacket. He finished 12 strokes clear of Jon Baker, his ninth title secured despite the worst Stableford showing by any Jacket winner. Neumann's 39 points lifted him to fifth overall. Patterson's agony persisted: blow-ups at the seventh, eighth, 10th, 17th and a nine at the 18th gave him six disasters in his final round. His 21 points capped an unprecedented collapse.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Alex Baker's maiden Trophy triumph was forged in the crucible of Round 3's lead scramble and sealed by a record-breaking finale. Eight points down after Round 1, he clawed level by Round 3's close, then pulled away with a 51-point masterpiece that no rival could match. His victory margin of 11 points, TEG's widest runner-up gap to date, underscored his second-half dominance. Remarkably, he managed just one birdie across 72 holes, his consistency in banking four-point scores proving more potent than fireworks.

Williams fought tenaciously on both fronts, leading or co-leading the Trophy after 54 holes and holding the Jacket lead entering the final round. Two runner-up finishes, 11 points and 25 strokes behind, marked a week of near-misses. Mullin's ninth Jacket crowned a peculiar campaign: he led for 68 of 72 Jacket holes yet finished 22 points behind in the Trophy, the widest-ever disconnect for a Jacket winner. Five blow-ups in Round 3 exposed rare fragility. Jon Baker's 157 points and second Jacket placing represented a solid week overshadowed by others.

Neumann's 144 points belied a rollercoaster: 11 zero-point holes undermined otherwise steady stretches. Patterson's Wooden Spoon, earned by 32 points and 81 strokes, was built on catastrophic foundations: 20 blow-ups, 22 scores worse than double bogey, zero birdies and an average of 33 over par per round. His implosion set new benchmarks for futility. Baker's redemption arc, from Spoon holder to Trophy champion, provided the tournament's most satisfying narrative. One birdie was all it took.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Alex Baker's 51-point final round represents the highest Stableford score in TEG history, surpassing David Mullin's 49 from Round 1 of the same tournament. Baker's 11-point victory margin is the largest runner-up gap recorded in TEG Trophy competition.

David Mullin's +4 gross in Round 1 marks the first sub-five Gross round in TEG history, breaking the previous best of +7. His nine Green Jacket titles extend his lead at the top of the all-time list.

John Patterson's 20 zero-point holes across 72 represents the most blow-ups in a single tournament. His 32-point Trophy deficit and 81-stroke Jacket deficit are the largest Wooden Spoon margins on record.

The 22-point gap between David Mullin's Jacket victory (+51) and Trophy placing (162 points, third) is the widest-ever disconnect between the two competitions for a Green Jacket winner. Mullin led for 68 of 72 holes in the Jacket but just 37 of 72 in the Trophy.

Alex Baker's victory with just one birdie across 72 holes is unprecedented; no previous Trophy winner has managed fewer than three birdies.
