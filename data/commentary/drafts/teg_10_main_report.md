## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Alex Baker claimed his maiden TEG Trophy title with an 11-point victory, overcoming an eight-point opening deficit to seize control in Round 3 and cruise home with a record-breaking 51-point final round. David Mullin dominated the gross competition from start to finish, leading all 72 holes to capture his eighth Green Jacket by a 12-stroke margin despite a middling Stableford performance that saw him finish third. The return to Portugal after a five-year absence brought drama aplenty, with Gregg Williams mounting a serious challenge before fading in the final round and John Patterson enduring a calamitous collapse that left him 72 points adrift.

Baker's consistency proved decisive. His scores ranged from 41 to 51 points across four rounds, a ten-point spread that outlasted Williams's wilder oscillations. The battle for the Trophy featured seven lead changes through three rounds before Baker pulled clear. Meanwhile, Mullin's wire-to-wire Jacket dominance showcased his ball-striking prowess even as the points totals told a different story.

## Round 1: Mullin's Boavista Masterclass {.round1 .round}

The tournament opened at Boavista, a parkland layout with Atlantic views that had hosted three previous TEG rounds. Mullin held the Trophy lead by eight points heading into Round 2. The early exchanges produced multiple lead swings as players wrestled with the course's varied challenges.

Mullin seized both competitions from the outset, carding an opening four at the first alongside Jon Baker to share the Jacket lead. Baker briefly held the Trophy advantage at the turn before Mullin reclaimed it at the tenth. Alex Baker threatened at the 11th with a four-point par but immediately surrendered his position with a triple bogey at the next. The middle stretch defined Mullin's round. Three birdies in four holes from the 13th to the 16th established his authority. His level-par stretch through holes six to eight set the platform, and he remained under par from the 12th onwards.

Behind the leader, chaos reigned. Alex Baker recorded blow-ups at the second and eighth, the latter a nine that cost him four points. Williams mixed brilliance with disaster, a birdie at the 13th offset by a nine at the 18th. Stuart Neumann's round unravelled spectacularly, six zero-point holes including a nine at the third and a ten at the closing hole leaving him 17 points off the pace. Jon Baker's 37 points kept him in touch, while Patterson's 29-point effort featured four blow-ups and hinted at troubles ahead.

Mullin's 49 points matched his personal best and set a new Boavista course record. His closing stretch of 20 points from holes 13 to 18 showcased his scoring potential. The eight-point cushion looked comfortable.

## Round 2: Williams Surges at Palmares {.round2 .round}

The field moved to Palmares for the Praia/Alvor combination, a 27-hole complex mixing parkland and links terrain. Mullin maintained his Trophy lead, now by five points, with Williams vaulting into second place. Jon Baker drew level with Alex Baker in the gross standings, while Patterson avoided further damage with a steady 35-point recovery.

Williams exploded into contention with a monster 48-point effort, his personal best. A birdie at the tenth sparked a run of 12 points across three holes as he climbed to within five of the lead. The front nine yielded 28 points, his strongest nine-hole stretch of the week. Alex Baker matched Williams's 45-point total with a birdie at the ninth, a five-pointer that provided his own highlight. His opening nine produced 28 points before a back-nine fade, including a blow-up at the 16th, pegged him back.

Mullin's 42 points represented solid rather than spectacular scoring. A six-hole stretch from the fourth onwards at level par maintained his position without extending his advantage. Jon Baker added 45 points of his own, a birdie at the second setting the tone, but his challenge remained focused on the Jacket rather than the Trophy.

Neumann endured another difficult day. Blow-ups at the 13th, 14th, and 15th produced zero points across three consecutive holes, 13 over par for the stretch. His collapse mirrored Patterson's struggles, though the latter showed resilience with 35 points after his opening meltdown. A ten at the first and subsequent troubles at the 10th and 11th kept him anchored at the bottom.

## Round 3: Baker and Williams Share the Lead {.round3 .round}

The Alvor/Lagos combination at Palmares provided the setting for a dramatic round that saw the Trophy lead change hands multiple times. Alex Baker and Williams emerged tied at the top, with Mullin's 31-point collapse dropping him to third despite retaining the Jacket lead. Patterson's nightmare deepened with two quintuple bogeys that signalled his unravelling.

Baker seized the Trophy lead from Mullin with a four-pointer at the fourth, the same hole where Mullin, Jon Baker, and Patterson all recorded blow-ups. Williams briefly held the advantage at the 13th after Baker's own quintuple at the par-five cost him five points. Baker regained control at the 15th as Mullin birdied alongside him. The lead changed three times in five holes. Williams closed with a birdie at the 17th to draw level heading into the final day, his 47-point round matching Baker's total.

Mullin's difficulties centered on a six-hole stretch from the eighth where he managed just five points, blow-ups at the ninth, 11th, and 13th punctuating his struggles. Yet birdies at the 15th and 17th kept him within touching distance of the leaders. Jon Baker's 35 points maintained his Jacket challenge, 20 strokes behind Mullin but clear of the chasing pack.

Patterson's round disintegrated spectacularly. A ten at the eighth preceded an eight at the 12th, both quintuple bogeys. From holes 12 to 14, he failed to register a single point, 14 over par across the three holes. His 27-point total dropped him further into isolation at the foot of the standings. Neumann offered a steadier 36 points but remained out of contention.

## Round 4: Baker's Breakthrough at Boavista {.round4 .round}

The tournament returned to Boavista for the finale, where Baker secured his first Trophy with a record-breaking 51-point performance. Williams started as joint leader but faded badly, while Mullin sealed his Jacket triumph with 40 points. Patterson's implosion reached its nadir with a sextuple bogey that capped the worst round of his career.

Baker seized control early. Williams lost the lead with a blow-up at the first. A birdie by Williams at the fifth briefly restored his advantage, but another blow-up at the sixth ended his challenge. From holes five to ten, Baker rattled off 21 points, including four-pointers at the sixth, seventh, and tenth. The surge proved decisive. Williams's 40 points represented solid scoring but could not match Baker's consistency across the closing stretch.

Mullin's fourth birdie of the tournament at the 16th ensured his Jacket margin remained comfortable. His 40-point effort, though modest by his opening standards, never looked under threat. Jon Baker's matching 40 points secured him second place in the gross standings, 13 strokes behind but clear of Williams in third.

Patterson's tournament ended in agony. An 11 at the eighth, a sextuple bogey, formed part of a six-hole spell from the seventh where he managed just five points, 17 over for the stretch. Blow-ups followed at the 10th, 17th, and 18th. His 21-point round represented a 19-point collapse from his second-round showing and left him with the Wooden Spoon, 72 points behind Baker and 20 zero-point holes across the week.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Alex Baker's maiden Trophy triumph arrived at the fourth attempt, breaking a run of three consecutive runner-up finishes. His 184-point total built on unwavering consistency, his ten-point spread across four rounds the tightest of any competitor. The breakthrough moment came in Round 3 when he wrested control from David Mullin, but the foundations were laid in Portugal's testing conditions, where patience and steady accumulation proved more valuable than pyrotechnics.

Mullin's eighth Green Jacket extended his record haul despite finishing third in the Stableford competition. Leading all 72 holes in the gross standings, his 12-stroke margin of victory underlined his ball-striking superiority. Four birdies, including three across Rounds 3 and 4, highlighted his class even as the points totals told a less flattering story. The divergence between his Jacket dominance and Trophy struggles illustrated the contrasting demands of the two competitions.

Gregg Williams came agonisingly close to a fourth Trophy, his 173 points and 48-point personal best in Round 2 demonstrating his quality. Yet blow-ups at the first, sixth, and 18th in the final round cost him dearly, an 11-point gap to Baker the cruel arithmetic of his challenge. Jon Baker secured runner-up in the Jacket by 13 strokes, his steady progress through the rounds rewarded with his strongest finish of the tournament. Stuart Neumann's 144 points represented mid-table solidity, while Patterson's collapse yielded a Spoon 32 points behind the next competitor.

Baker's 51-point finale equalled a new all-time TEG record, the perfect exclamation point on a week where consistency conquered chaos and Portugal delivered drama worthy of a five-year wait.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Alex Baker's 51-point final round ranks as the highest single-round Stableford total in TEG history, surpassing David Mullin's 49-point opening effort at the same tournament. Baker's consistency across the week saw him lead for 36 of 72 holes in the Trophy competition despite never holding the Jacket lead, while Mullin achieved the inverse, dominating the gross standings for 68 holes but leading the Trophy for just 37.

David Mullin's opening +4 gross score at Boavista established a new course record and marked his best 18-hole gross performance, bettering his previous mark of +8. His six birdies across the tournament contrasted sharply with John Patterson's zero, the widest birdie differential in the field.

Patterson's 20 zero-point holes represented 27.8% of his tournament, the highest percentage recorded at TEG 10. His cumulative gross score of +132 left him 81 strokes behind Mullin, the largest gap between winner and Spoon recipient since TEG 7. His Round 4 collapse of 19 points between consecutive rounds marked the steepest single-round decline of the week.

Gregg Williams's 48-point Round 2 at Palmares equalled the second-highest Stableford round in Algarve across three tournaments, trailing only Alex Baker's finale. Williams's four birdies tied him with Jon Baker for second place in that category behind Mullin's six.
