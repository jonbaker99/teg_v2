# TEG 9: A Comprehensive Study in Psychological Collapse and Recovery {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 9 | Lisbon Coast | 2016</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

John PATTERSON arrived at his first TEG like a man who'd accidentally wandered into someone else's wedding and decided to marry the bride himself. He left with the Trophy, having survived a third-round meltdown so catastrophic it generated its own gravitational field. His 22-point collapse from Round 2 to Round 3 represented the largest implosion by any Trophy leader in TEG history, a record nobody was trying to set. That he recovered to win by six points suggests either remarkable mental fortitude or complete amnesia.

David MULLIN claimed his seventh Green Jacket with the emotional range of a man ticking boxes on a form. Wire-to-wire Gross dominance, never trailing across 72 holes, extending his Jacket collection to absurd levels. Alex BAKER's final-round charge (44 points, best of the tournament) pulled him to second place but fell six points short, which in golf terms is the difference between almost and absolutely not. Stuart NEUMANN collected his second Wooden Spoon, finishing 41 points back, a gap that requires its own postcode.

The Lisbon Coast returned for consecutive duty, alternating between Royal Óbidos (Seve Ballesteros' final design, a parkland monument to strategic cruelty) and Praia D'El Rey (links-parkland hybrid where the back nine could double as a lunar landscape). The field produced 41 zero-point holes across four rounds. Democracy in action, really.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**John PATTERSON (1st, Trophy Winner):** Debut Trophy, debut dominance, debut complete psychological disintegration on Royal Óbidos. His Round 2 masterclass (49 points, three birdies) gave him a 10-point cushion before Round 3 delivered four zero-point holes and the kind of scorecard that gets framed as a warning. That he regrouped with 47 points in Round 4 to seal victory by six suggests PATTERSON possesses either ice in his veins or a convenient short-term memory disorder. Led 54 of 72 holes, which mathematically is three-quarters of the time, and emotionally approximately nine years.

**Alex BAKER (2nd):** Career-best finish, achieved through the time-honoured method of being slightly less terrible than everyone except the winner. His 44-point final round briefly gave him the Trophy lead at Hole 14 before consecutive blow-ups on 15 and 16 reminded him that hope is a psychological construct designed to cause suffering. Birdies on 8 and 13 represented genuine excellence; the rest was mitigation. Six points short, which in alternate universes is victory, but this isn't an alternate universe.

**David MULLIN (3rd, Green Jacket Winner):** Seventh Jacket, tenth career, wire-to-wire Gross authority that made everyone else's scorecards look like ransom notes. Never trailed across 72 holes, which suggests either consistency or everyone else being consistently worse. A quintuple bogey on Round 3, Hole 10, proved he's mortal, though the subsequent recovery suggested mortality was optional. Ten-stroke margin of victory, which in sporting terms is called "not close."

**Jon BAKER (4th):** Led after Round 1 by a single point, then spent three rounds watching his Trophy prospects fade like hope at a Monday morning meeting. A birdie on Round 4, Hole 3, showed flashes of competence; blow-ups on Holes 7, 11, 16, and 17 showed reality. Fourth place, which is golf's way of saying "thanks for participating."

**Gregg WILLIAMS (5th):** Steady decline from Round 2 (36 points) to Round 4 (38 points). Wait, that's an improvement. Mathematics never lies, but golf does. A catastrophic 11 on Round 4, Hole 7, representing six over par and approximately 15 minutes of existential crisis. Fifth place, 25 points behind the winner, which is competitive only in theoretical physics.

**Stuart NEUMANN (6th, Wooden Spoon):** Second Spoon, 41 points adrift, suggesting NEUMANN has mastered the art of being consistently behind. A birdie on Round 4, Hole 13, proved he can play golf when the pressure is entirely hypothetical. The rest was a study in optimism meeting topography.

## Round 1: The Theatre of Optimistic Delusion {.round1 .round}

Royal Óbidos greeted the field with Seve Ballesteros' final design philosophy: strategic water hazards, undulating fairways, and the implicit question "why are you here?" Jon BAKER seized the opening-round Trophy lead with 39 points, one point clear of PATTERSON and MULLIN, which in TEG terms is called "a margin."

The opening hole established the round's emotional tenor. WILLIAMS arrived at the first tee with ambition; departed with a nine (five over) and zero points, having discovered that Par 4s don't negotiate. BAKER clung to his lead until the 18th, where a blow-up (nine, four over) cost him the Trophy summit and handed the Gross lead to MULLIN, who'd made par. Democracy in action.

PATTERSON's round was biographical. A blow-up on Hole 4 (10 strokes, six over) suggested debut nerves; a birdie on 17 suggested selective amnesia. NEUMANN's front nine (17 points) hinted at competence before his back nine (six points) remembered who he was. The 15th hole witnessed three blow-ups simultaneously (BAKER, WILLIAMS, NEUMANN), suggesting either course design excellence or collective psychological collapse. Both, probably.

Jon BAKER led by one point. MULLIN led Gross by two strokes. The tournament had shape, which in golf means "things that will change."

## Round 2: The Coronation and Its Footnotes {.round2 .round}

Praia D'El Rey's links-parkland hybrid provided the stage for PATTERSON's hostile takeover. He seized the Trophy lead on Hole 1 (BAKER's triple bogey provided the assist), briefly lost it on Hole 2 (MULLIN's par), reclaimed it on Hole 11, and never released it. His 49-point masterclass featured birdies on Holes 7 and 12, a remarkable 11-point streak from 10 to 12, and the kind of scorecard that gets photographed for evidence.

MULLIN maintained wire-to-wire Gross control with 39 points, a birdie on Hole 10, and the emotional range of a tax accountant. BAKER's 44 points (second-best of the round) kept him mathematically viable. BAKER's birdie on 17 arrived too late to matter but looked excellent.

WILLIAMS' catastrophic nine on Hole 9 (six over) represented the round's nadir, unless you count NEUMANN's consecutive blow-ups on Holes 11, 12, and 13, which suggested someone had offended the golfing gods. BAKER's hot streak (25 points across the front nine) demonstrated what's possible when the course forgets to fight back.

PATTERSON led by 10 points. MULLIN led Gross by seven strokes. The tournament appeared settled, which in sport is called "tempting fate."

## Round 3: A Case Study in Spectacular Unraveling {.round3 .round}

Royal Óbidos witnessed the most complete psychological collapse in Trophy-leading history. PATTERSON's 22-point plunge from 49 to 34 points featured four zero-point holes (3, 8, 12, 18) and the kind of body language usually associated with hostage situations. A blow-up on Hole 3, triple bogey on Hole 4, blow-up on Hole 12, and final-hole disaster reduced his 10-point cushion to three points. That he maintained the Trophy lead at all represents either remarkable resilience or everyone else's incompetence. Both, definitely.

BAKER surged to the round's best score (42 points), his front nine (24 points) a masterclass in capitalising on others' misery. WILLIAMS and NEUMANN tied for second with 38 and 37 points respectively, career-best efforts that would've been celebrated had anyone been paying attention. BAKER's 18-point stretch across the opening nine holes suggested championship form before the back nine (18 points) reminded him about reality.

MULLIN's 33 points (round-worst among Trophy contenders) included a quintuple bogey on Hole 10 that proved even wire-to-wire Gross leaders occasionally remember they're human. His Jacket lead extended nonetheless, which tells you everything about the field's competence levels. BAKER's birdie on Hole 2 provided hope; BAKER's blow-up on Hole 7 withdrew it. PATTERSON clung to a three-point Trophy lead like a man holding a fraying rope.

## Round 4: Redemption, Futility, and Administrative Conclusions {.round4 .round}

Praia D'El Rey hosted the final act: PATTERSON's recovery masterclass versus BAKER's doomed charge versus MULLIN's Jacket procession. PATTERSON's 47 points (second-best of the round) featured a birdie on Hole 12 and immediate recovery from a Hole 5 blow-up with four points on Hole 6, suggesting selective memory or brilliant compartmentalisation. His Trophy lead extended to six points, which in golf means "comfortable."

BAKER's 44 points (best of the round, tied with his Round 2 personal best) included birdies on Holes 8 and 13, briefly claiming the Trophy lead at Hole 14 before consecutive blow-ups on 15 and 16 reminded him that hope is provisional. His final margin: six points short, which translates to "not quite."

MULLIN's 38 points and wire-to-wire Gross dominance secured his seventh Jacket by 10 strokes, extending his record collection to levels that require museum curation. A blow-up on Hole 1 proved he's mortal; the subsequent recovery proved mortality was negotiable. WILLIAMS and NEUMANN tied for third-round honours with 38 and 37 points respectively, achievements that would've mattered in alternate timelines.

BAKER's 21-point hot streak from Holes 8 to 13 represented the tournament's finest sustained excellence; his immediate collapse on 15 and 16 represented its most predictable narrative arc. PATTERSON led all 18 holes, which mathematically is called "wire-to-wire" and emotionally is called "relief." MULLIN's Jacket procession concluded without drama, which is how he prefers it.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

John PATTERSON claimed his debut Trophy through a psychological journey that encompassed dominance, catastrophic collapse, and redemptive recovery. His Round 2 masterclass (49 points) established a 10-point cushion before Round 3's historic 22-point implosion nearly cost him everything. Four zero-point holes, a triple bogey, and the kind of scorecard that generates its own weather system reduced his lead to three points. That he regrouped with 47 points in Round 4 to win by six suggests either remarkable mental fortitude or the ability to completely forget Saturday ever happened.

David MULLIN's seventh Green Jacket arrived with wire-to-wire Gross authority, leading all 72 holes and extending his Jacket collection to absurd levels. A 10-stroke margin of victory, consistent scoring (33 to 39 points across four rounds), and the emotional range of a man filing quarterly reports. Alex BAKER's career-best second place featured the tournament's joint-best round (44 points, twice) and a final-round charge that briefly claimed the Trophy lead before consecutive blow-ups on 15 and 16 reminded him that hope is provisional. Six points short, which in alternate universes is victory.

The Lisbon Coast provided the backdrop: Royal Óbidos' strategic cruelty (Seve's final design, a monument to water hazards and undulating fairways) and Praia D'El Rey's links-parkland hybrid (dramatic coastal dunes, European rankings, and a back nine that could double as a moonscape). The field produced 41 zero-point holes and 12 birdies across 432 holes played (2.8% success rate), suggesting either course excellence or collective mediocrity. Both, obviously.

Stuart NEUMANN's second Wooden Spoon (41 points back) represented consistency of a sort. The tournament belonged to PATTERSON, who survived history's largest Trophy-leading collapse to claim debut victory. The psychological toll remains unquantified. The Trophy cabinet doesn't ask questions.

## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}

**TEG Records:**
- Largest single-round drop by Trophy leader: John PATTERSON's 22-point collapse (Round 2: 49pts → Round 3: 34pts)

**Personal Bests:**
- John PATTERSON: Round 1 Gross (28), Round 1 Stableford (38 points), Round 2 Gross (14), Round 2 Stableford (49 points - all debut achievements)
- Alex BAKER: Round 2 Gross (27), Round 2 Stableford (44 points), Round 4 Gross (27), Round 4 Stableford (44 points - tied personal best twice)

**Personal Worsts:**
- Alex BAKER: Round 1 Gross (43 - 9th appearance)
- John PATTERSON: Round 3 Gross (29), Round 3 Stableford (34 points - both on debut)

No course records were broken. Royal Óbidos' record (86, Jon BAKER, TEG 17, Round 3) and Praia D'El Rey's record (83, David MULLIN, TEG 7, Round 4) remained intact, which tells you everything about the field's ambitions versus their capabilities.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Scoring Distribution:**
The tournament witnessed 41 zero-point Stableford holes across the field, representing approximately 9.5% of all holes played. Democracy in action, really. Only 12 birdies were recorded across 432 holes (2.8% success rate), suggesting either course difficulty or collective incompetence. The data supports both hypotheses.

**Lead Changes:**
Trophy leadership changed hands seven times across the first two rounds before PATTERSON seized permanent control from Round 2, Hole 11 onwards. He led 54 of 72 holes (75%), including all 18 holes in Round 4. MULLIN led Gross wire-to-wire (100% of holes), which statistically is called "dominance" and practically is called "everyone else being worse."

**Momentum Patterns:**
PATTERSON's hot streaks (20-point stretches in Round 2, holes 7-12, 10-15, 12-17) contrasted sharply with his Round 3 collapse. BAKER's consistent front-nine excellence (18-25 points across Rounds 1-3) suggested morning competence before afternoon reality intervened. NEUMANN's round-by-round scores (23, 30, 37, 37) represented steady improvement, which mathematically is progress and practically is still finishing last.

**Collapse Analytics:**
PATTERSON's four zero-point holes in Round 3 matched the combined total of his first two rounds. His recovery rate (22-point drop followed by 13-point gain) suggests either remarkable resilience or everyone else's incompetence providing cover. The statistical evidence supports both interpretations.

**Course Performance:**
Royal Óbidos averaged 32.5 points per round across the field; Praia D'El Rey averaged 40 points. This 7.5-point differential suggests either design difficulty or the field's psychological relationship with Seve's final creation. Probably both. MULLIN's consistency (38-39 points across all rounds) proved that competence is reproducible, assuming you're David MULLIN.
