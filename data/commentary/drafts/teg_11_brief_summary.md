Jon Baker swept both the Trophy and Green Jacket in Catalonia 2018, wire-to-wire across PGA Catalunya and El Prat. The dominant front-runner led 59 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in Gross, sealing his second Trophy and first Jacket with final margins of six points and three strokes.

Alex Baker claimed second place by six points despite a catastrophic final-round meltdown. His career-worst 27 points—featuring five triple-bogeys and nine scoreless holes—squandered the Trophy lead he'd seized briefly in Round 3. Jon Baker's Round 2 performance of 84 (+12) equalled the course record at PGA Catalunya's Tour Course but was never bettered across the week.

David Mullin earned the Wooden Spoon with 125 points despite finishing runner-up in the Jacket at +73, just three strokes behind Baker. John Patterson produced the tournament's wildest swings: a disaster-filled opener (26 points, eight blow-ups) followed by the week's joint-best Stableford round (36 points) in the finale.
