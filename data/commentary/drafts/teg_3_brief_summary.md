# TEG 3: Baker's Wire-to-Wire Triumph in the Algarve

Jon Baker claimed his first TEG Trophy with a dominant wire-to-wire performance at Boavista, Portugal. Leading all 72 holes from the opening tee shot, he won by 17 points over David Mullin. Mullin secured his second Green Jacket with a 12-stroke victory, never seriously challenged after Round 1.

Stuart Neumann's tournament unravelled in spectacular fashion on the 71st hole. Standing second in the Jacket with one hole remaining, his quintuple bogey (+6) on the par-4 17th plunged him to the Wooden Spoon. The catastrophe came just one hole after a birdie had briefly offered hope. The tournament suffered a birdie drought—just five across 360 holes, with Henry Meller claiming four of them.

Meller's roller-coaster week typified the scoring carnage: tournament-high four birdies couldn't overcome ten blow-ups. Gregg Williams endured eleven meltdowns across 72 holes, the field's worst volatility. Baker's victory margin matched his dominance—extending his lead each round from eight points to the final 17-point cushion.
