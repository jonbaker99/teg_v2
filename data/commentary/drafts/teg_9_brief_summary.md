# TEG 9: Lisbon Coast, Portugal (2016)

John Patterson seized the Trophy in his debut appearance, trading blows with David Mullin before pulling away to a 6-point victory. Mullin claimed his record seventh Green Jacket with a wire-to-wire gross performance, leading all 72 holes and winning by 10 strokes.

Patterson's triumph survived a historic Round 3 collapse—a catastrophic 22-point crash from 49 to 34 points, featuring four zero-point holes. He'd built a commanding 10-point cushion after Round 2 with birdies at the 7th and 12th at Praia D'El Rey, only to see it evaporate to just 3 points after his Royal Óbidos meltdown. Alex Baker's late surge—44 points in Round 4, the best of the week—carried him to second place overall but couldn't overcome Patterson's recovery performance of 47 points.

The tournament played out across Royal Óbidos and Praia D'El Rey, with brutal conditions producing 41 total blobs across the field and just 12 birdies in 432 holes. Stuart Neumann collected his second Wooden Spoon, finishing 41 points back in sixth.
