# TEG 4: A Comprehensive Field Study in Optimism Meeting Reality {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 4 | East Sussex | 2011</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

What follows is the documented story of five men who traveled to East Sussex with golf clubs and hope, returning with only the clubs. David Mullin emerged victorious in both competitions, securing his second Trophy and third Green Jacket through a combination of strategic competence and watching his opponents implode with the regularity of cheap fireworks. Jon Baker held the Trophy lead for forty-nine holes before orchestrating a back-nine collapse of such spectacular magnitude that it deserved its own Wikipedia entry. Henry Meller posted the tournament's best round (36 points) in Round 2, briefly creating TEG's first tied leaderboard before reality reasserted itself with its customary brutality.

The week featured ten lead changes across Rounds 2-4, three different leaders, and a three-way battle that resembled less a sporting contest and more a psychological experiment gone catastrophically wrong. Gregg Williams earned his first career Wooden Spoon with 110 points and fourteen blow-ups spread across four courses like crime scene markers. The only eagle of the tournament came from Baker's H8 stunner in Round 4, a brief moment of brilliance before the wheels came off with the finality of a mortgage foreclosure.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**David Mullin (Winner, Trophy & Jacket):** Swept both competitions with 137 points and plus 81, leading sixty-four of seventy-two Trophy holes and all seventy-two Jacket holes in a display of relentless competence that probably felt less like victory and more like endurance sport. His Round 4 surge (36 points) came precisely when Baker's nervous system decided to retire from golf forever, transforming a tight battle into a comfortable three-point margin that suggested nothing had ever been in doubt.

**Jon Baker (2nd, Trophy):** Led or co-led for forty-nine holes before experiencing what can only be described as a catastrophic neurological event disguised as golf. An 11 on the Par 5 fifteenth followed by a 9 on the Par 3 twelfth in Round 4, plus six and plus six respectively, each scoring zero points with the precision of a man systematically destroying his own championship hopes. His eagle on H8 in the final round was the tournament's only one, proving he possessed the ability to achieve greatness and disaster with equal facility.

**Henry Meller (3rd, Trophy):** Posted the tournament's best round (36 points) in Round 2 to claim a share of the lead, then spent the remaining thirty-six holes demonstrating why momentary excellence is the enemy of sustained mediocrity. His catastrophic 12 on H11 in Round 1 (plus nine) remains the worst single hole of the tournament, a mathematical atrocity that set the tone for a week of glorious inconsistency.

**Stuart Neumann (4th, Trophy):** Finished with 120 points and plus 100, occupying fourth place with the dignity of a man who understood early that victory was not written in the stars. His birdie on H5 in Round 3 briefly suggested hope before blow-ups on H10 and H11 the same round confirmed that hope was merely postponed suffering.

**Gregg Williams (Wooden Spoon):** Collected his first career Spoon with 110 points and plus 152, recording fourteen blow-ups that averaged 3.5 per round with the consistency of a metronome. Led the Trophy for thirteen holes, the Jacket for two, and spent the remaining fifty-seven contemplating how quickly optimism can curdle into regret. His personal worst gross score of 43 in Round 4 now stands fifty-fifth of fifty-five in TEG history, a record that will outlive us all.

## Round 1: The Theatre of Initial Optimism {.round1 .round}

Royal Ashdown Forest Golf Club presented itself as the sort of heathland course that eschews bunkers entirely, relying on natural features to inflict damage. This proved sufficient. The course sits high above sea level with spectacular views, offering players the opportunity to see precisely how far off-course their balls had traveled.

Gregg Williams opened with a 4-point haul on H1, seizing both Trophy and Jacket leads with the confidence of a man who didn't yet know what was coming. Henry Meller recorded a blow-up on the same hole (7, plus three, zero points), falling to fifth in the Trophy standings before the first green had been properly appreciated. The Par 3 eleventh became the site of what can only be described as multiple acts of violence against scorecards. Meller posted a 12 (plus nine, zero points), the worst single hole of the entire tournament. Stuart Neumann added a 7 (plus four, zero points). Williams contributed a 6 (plus three, one point). Three grown men stood on an innocent par three and collectively decided sanity was negotiable.

The carnage continued. Holes 12 through 18 witnessed six additional blow-ups spread across four players like shrapnel. Williams recorded his sixth blow-up of the round on H17, having opened strong before discovering that strength is merely deferred weakness. Neumann closed with an 8 on the eighteenth (plus four, zero points), while Baker suffered a massive 9 on H14 (plus five, zero points), proving that even eventual contenders must first experience humiliation. David Morrison collected two birdies (H10 and H13) amidst four blow-ups, demonstrating that excellence and disaster can coexist within the same round like hostile roommates.

Jon Baker emerged with 35 points and a four-point lead. Morrison led the Jacket on plus 23. The standings suggested order. This was a lie.

## Round 2: The Emergence of False Patterns {.round2 .round}

Lingfield Park Golf Club is a mature parkland course featuring grand trees and water hazards, offering what the brochure described as a challenging but fair test. Fair is a relative term when applied to men carrying twenty-four handicaps and lingering trauma from yesterday's eleventh hole.

Henry Meller posted 36 points, the tournament's best round, vaulting from joint fourth to co-leader with David Mullin at 64 points total. This represented TEG's first tied leaderboard in its brief but emotionally scarring history. Baker managed only 28 points after a 9 on H17 (plus five, zero points) cost him the outright lead. Mullin closed poorly with blow-ups on H17 and H18, yet somehow maintained co-leadership through the mathematical magic of everyone else collapsing simultaneously.

The Par 3 first hole witnessed immediate disasters. Mullin recorded a 6 (plus three, zero points). Neumann matched it, hitting bottom in the Spoon standings before the round had properly begun. His 9 on the Par 5 second (plus four, zero points) confirmed that rock bottom has a basement. Baker produced the round's only birdie on H3 (3, minus one, five points), briefly suggesting competence before his late-round implosion on H17 reminded everyone that competence is merely a temporary condition. Williams contributed blow-ups on H3, H8, and H9, collecting 31 points total through sheer force of stubborn persistence.

The leaderboard churned. Mullin took the Trophy lead at H11, lost it at H12. Baker lost his lead at H14, briefly shared it, then watched it evaporate at H17 like morning dew in a furnace. The narrative arc resembled less a sporting contest and more a prolonged nervous breakdown conducted in public.

## Round 3: The Architecture of Collapse Begins {.round3 .round}

Crowborough Beacon Golf Club sits at high elevation on classic heathland, featuring eight holes redesigned by Alister MacKenzie. MacKenzie presumably designed them to test skill and strategy. They tested sanity instead. The Par 4 fifteenth became a mass casualty event, with Williams, Meller, Baker, and Neumann all recording blow-ups in a synchronized display of futility that suggested either cosmic intervention or performance art.

Meller lost the Trophy lead immediately on H1 (7, plus three, zero points). Baker reclaimed it two holes later with a 3-point haul on H2. Mullin seized control at H10 (5, even par, three points) before surrendering it one hole later. The lead changed hands with the frequency of a carnival game rigged against contestants who don't realize they're contestants. Stuart Neumann managed a birdie on H5 (3, minus one, four points) before joining the blow-up parade on H10 and H11, scoring zero points twice in succession like a man committed to statistical consistency.

Williams opened with blow-ups on H2, H4, and H5, collecting one point across the first six holes. He finished strong (relatively speaking) with seventeen points on the back nine, escaping last place on the final hole with a 7 on H18 (plus three, one point). This represented progress. Meller posted only eight back-nine points, his championship hopes evaporating like spilled gin on hot concrete. Baker held a one-point lead with eighteen holes remaining. This was not the advantage it appeared to be.

## Round 4: The Spectacular Unraveling {.round4 .round}

Bletchingley Golf Club is a modern parkland course known for excellent drainage and fast playing conditions. Fast conditions are ideal for good golf. This was not good golf. Jon Baker arrived at the final round leading the Trophy by one point, positioned to claim his second TEG championship. What followed was a psychological collapse of such comprehensive horror that it deserved academic study.

Baker opened brilliantly. Birdie on H2 (2, minus one, four points). Eagle on the Par 4 eighth (2, minus two, five points), the tournament's only eagle and a shot so pure it seemed to come from a different player entirely. Through eight holes he led comfortably. Then came H10: blow-up. Then H12: a 9 on the Par 3 (plus six, zero points). Then H14: another blow-up. Then H15: an 11 on the Par 5 (plus six, zero points). Four blow-ups in six holes. Twenty-three front-nine points became nine back-nine points, the sort of split that suggests not poor play but existential crisis.

David Mullin took the Trophy lead at H14 and never relinquished it. His 36-point round matched Meller's earlier best, seizing control while Baker's nervous system filed for bankruptcy. Meller posted 34 points, hampered by a 10 on H11 (plus five, zero points). Neumann managed 32 points and plus 22, his steadiest round. Williams collected his fourteenth and final blow-up on H14, posting 23 points and plus 43, a personal worst gross that now occupies fifty-fifth position in TEG's all-time rankings. The scoreboard at Bletchingley told the story in numbers. The faces told it better.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

David Mullin secured his second Trophy and third Green Jacket by posting 137 Stableford points and plus 81 gross across four rounds in East Sussex, leading the Trophy for sixty-four of seventy-two holes and the Jacket for all seventy-two in a display of sustained competence that resembled less domination and more refusing to self-destruct. His three-point Trophy margin over Jon Baker represented comfortable victory, though the nineteen-stroke Jacket margin told a more comprehensive story about who maintained composure while others discovered new frontiers in psychological collapse.

Baker's tournament arc followed the classic tragedy structure: early promise, mounting tension, catastrophic reversal, despair. He led or co-led for forty-nine holes before recording four blow-ups in six holes during Round 4, including an 11 and a 9 that transformed certain victory into statistical footnote. His eagle on H8 in the final round, the tournament's only one, proved he possessed genuine ability. His back nine proved ability is negotiable under pressure.

Henry Meller's 36-point Round 2 created TEG's first tied leaderboard and briefly suggested he might claim his first championship. He finished third on 121 points, undone by his catastrophic 12 on H11 in Round 1 and a Round 3 performance that collected only eight back-nine points. Stuart Neumann occupied fourth with steady if unspectacular play, posting 120 points and plus 100. Gregg Williams collected the Wooden Spoon with 110 points and plus 152, recording fourteen blow-ups across seventy-two holes at an average rate of 3.5 per round. His personal worst gross of 43 in Round 4 now stands permanently in TEG's record books, a mathematical monument to persistence in the face of overwhelming evidence that stopping might be wise.

The week witnessed ten lead changes, three different leaders, one eagle, seven birdies, and fifty-eight blow-ups spread across four pristine courses in East Sussex and Surrey. Royal Ashdown Forest, Lingfield Park, Crowborough Beacon, and Bletchingley Golf Club provided the stages. Five men provided the tragicomedy. Golf provided the script.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Blow-Up Analysis:**
Fifty-eight total blow-ups occurred across seventy-two holes, averaging 0.81 blow-ups per hole played per player. Gregg Williams led with fourteen (24.1% of tournament total), followed by Henry Meller with twelve and Jon Baker with eleven. The Par 3 eleventh at Ashdown accounted for three blow-ups in a single hole, the tournament's highest concentration of disaster per square meter of turf.

**Lead Change Volatility:**
Ten lead changes occurred from Round 2 onwards, with Mullin, Baker, and Meller each holding outright leads. Baker led for forty-nine holes before his Round 4 collapse. Mullin led for sixty-four Trophy holes total and all seventy-two Jacket holes, suggesting that consistency defeats brilliance when brilliance is interrupted by regular catastrophe.

**Front Nine vs Back Nine Performance:**
Jon Baker posted a plus fourteen split favoring the front nine in Round 4 (23 front, 9 back), the tournament's largest collapse differential. Gregg Williams showed the opposite pattern in Rounds 2 and 3, posting stronger back nines by five and seven points respectively, suggesting either improved play or lowered expectations as rounds progressed.

**Birdie Scarcity:**
Seven total birdies across two hundred and eighty individual holes (0.025 birdie rate). One eagle (Baker's H8 in Round 4). This represented a combined birdie-or-better rate of 2.9%, confirming that par remained aspirational rather than baseline throughout.

**Course-Specific Brutality:**
Round 1 at Ashdown produced seventeen blow-ups, the tournament's highest single-round total. Bletchingley in Round 4 yielded fourteen blow-ups despite being the final round when players theoretically understood their games. This suggested either course difficulty or complete abandonment of whatever lessons had been learned across the previous fifty-four holes.
