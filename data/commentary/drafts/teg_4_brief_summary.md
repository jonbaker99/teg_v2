# TEG 4: Mullin's Double Sweep Survives Baker's Epic Collapse

East Sussex, England, 2011. Four new courses—Ashdown, Lingfield, Crowborough, and Bletchingley.

David Mullin claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket, holding off Jon Baker by 3 points (137-134) and 19 strokes (+81/+113). But Mullin's double sweep nearly slipped away when Baker, leading after 63 holes, imploded spectacularly on the back nine. An 11-stroke meltdown on H15 and a 9-stroke car-crash on H12 evaporated Baker's lead instantly, handing Mullin control at H14 that he never surrendered.

Baker's collapse capped a chaotic week of lead changes and dramatic swings. Henry Meller's tournament-best 36-point Round 2 vaulted him from fourth to co-leader, creating the event's first tied leaderboard. The trio of former champions—Mullin (defending), Baker (TEG 1 winner), and Meller—traded blows through 10 lead changes across the final three rounds before Baker's catastrophic finale settled the outcome.

The week's only eagle belonged to Baker himself: a stunning 2-stroke conversion on H8 in Round 4, just holes before his championship dreams unraveled. Gregg Williams earned his first career Wooden Spoon (110 points/+152) after 14 blow-ups, including a quadruple-bogey opening salvo in Round 3 that briefly dropped him to last place before a final-hole escape.
