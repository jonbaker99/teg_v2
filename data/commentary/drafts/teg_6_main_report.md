## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams claimed his second TEG Trophy with a performance of jarring extremes, leading from wire to wire yet requiring a dramatic final-round escape to hold off Jon Baker by three points. Williams opened with a personal-best 48 points, then closed with a catastrophic 28-point round featuring eight blow-ups. David Mullin secured his record fourth Green Jacket by four strokes over Baker, who came agonisingly close to sweeping both competitions. The warm Catalan sun provided little relief for competitors battling Spain's championship courses for the first time.

The tournament split trophies for the third consecutive TEG. Williams dominated Stableford from start to finish. Mullin controlled Gross despite finishing fourth in the points competition. Baker's runner-up finishes in both formats told the story of opportunities lost, including a sextuple-bogey disaster at the ninth in the final round when briefly holding both leads. The tournament produced 53 triple-bogeys or worse, the most volatile scoring in TEG history.

## Round 1: Opening Salvo at PGA Catalunya {.round1 .round}

The TEG arrived in Catalonia for the first time, tackling PGA Catalunya's Tour Course under cloudless Spanish skies. Williams held a commanding position from the opening tee shots. Baker stumbled immediately with a triple at the first. The chase was on.

Williams seized control through the middle stretch. His birdie at the 11th sparked a surge. He collected 18 points across holes six through 11, mixing aggression with steady play. Another birdie at the 14th extended the run. Four points at the par-five 15th capped a remarkable sequence of 22 points across holes ten through 15. Baker recovered from his opening mishap with sustained scoring on the back nine, including a birdie at the 17th, but trailed by nine points.

Mullin took the Gross lead early but surrendered it at the second. Williams briefly held the Jacket before Mullin reclaimed it at the third. The Gross battle swung hole to hole in the opening stretch, settling with Mullin ahead by one stroke over Baker. Stuart Neumann suffered a quintuple-bogey at the ninth. Henry Meller endured blow-ups at both par fives on the back nine, setting an unfortunate tone for his week.

Williams closed on 48 points and 20 over par, both personal records. Baker posted 39 points and 18 over. Mullin's 17 over gave him the slenderest of Jacket margins. The nine-point Trophy gap looked substantial, but the volatility to come would test that cushion severely.

## Round 2: Costa Brava Carnage {.round2 .round}

Costa Brava's woodland parkland layout proved treacherous in the afternoon heat. Williams maintained his Trophy advantage despite six blow-ups. The Gross competition remained tightly contested. Mullin extended his Jacket lead to five strokes with steady play across the contrasting nines.

Williams endured a nightmare opening stretch with blow-ups at the second and third holes. Another disaster arrived at the seventh. He triple-bogeyed the 14th, blew up at the 15th, then suffered another at the 16th. Six catastrophic holes. Yet he salvaged something extraordinary from the wreckage. A birdie at the 17th rescued 36 points from a round threatening total collapse. Baker matched Williams on 36 points but also endured a horror show, including blow-ups at the second and 11th.

Meller produced the tournament's best single-round performance. His 41 points topped the field. Seventeen over matched Mullin's Gross score. Three consecutive pars through the turn steadied the ship before four points at the 12th highlighted a six-hole stretch of 18 points. His strong middle section contrasted sharply with continued struggles elsewhere in his round.

Mullin and Neumann both posted 37 points. Mullin's 17 over strengthened his Jacket position. Williams slipped to 52 over cumulative, conceding Gross contention but preserving his nine-point Trophy cushion. The gap to Baker remained unchanged. Control felt illusory.

## Round 3: Norman's Rosa Delivers Drama {.round3 .round}

El Prat's prestigious Rosa Course set the stage for a Jacket lead change. Williams held his Trophy margin at seven points entering the final round. Baker seized the Gross lead on the 18th hole with a dramatic intervention. Mullin's collapse changed everything.

The middle holes delivered punishment. Williams blew up at the seventh. Baker and Meller both carded disasters at the eighth, where Meller posted a sextuple and Baker a quintuple. The carnage defined the front nine. Williams recovered on the back nine to post 19 points across the final stretch, preserving his Trophy cushion. Baker matched the finish with 20 back-nine points.

Mullin appeared secure in the Jacket until the closing stretch unravelled. A quintuple at the 15th began the slide. Another blow-up at the 16th continued it. He reached the par-five 18th needing damage control. A quadruple-bogey nine handed Baker the lead by one stroke. Just 28 points across the round dropped Mullin to 63 over cumulative.

Neumann topped the round with 36 points but remained well back in third place overall. Baker's 35 points combined with his clutch par at the 18th flipped the Jacket standings. Williams led the Trophy by seven points. Baker led the Jacket by one stroke. Both competitions remained wide open.

## Round 4: Stadium Chaos Crowns Unlikely Victors {.round4 .round}

PGA Catalunya's world-class Stadium Course hosted the finale. Spain's premier layout delivered maximum drama. Williams faced the fight of his tournament life. Multiple lead changes in both competitions kept outcomes uncertain until the closing holes.

Williams lost the Trophy lead at the seventh hole. A quadruple there handed Baker the advantage. Williams regained it at the tenth. He lost it again at the 11th. He reclaimed it for good through the middle stretch, posting four points at the 12th. His back nine produced 18 points, salvaging victory from eight total blow-ups including disasters at the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth, 15th, 16th, and 18th. Twenty-eight points represented a 20-point swing from his opening round. He won by three.

Baker's charge fell apart at the ninth. A ten, six over par, handed the Gross lead to Mullin. Baker regained the Jacket lead briefly at the 16th before losing it again at the 17th. Triple-bogeys at the 12th and a quadruple at the 18th ended his hopes. Thirty-two points left him three short. Four strokes behind in Gross. So close. So far.

Mullin's birdie at the fourth ignited the best Gross round of the day. Twenty-two over reclaimed the Jacket from Baker's grasp. Three consecutive pars through the turn steadied the ship during the chaos. A blow-up at the 15th threatened the lead but Baker's collapse at the ninth had done the crucial damage. Mullin's fourth Jacket was secure.

Neumann matched Baker on 32 points. Meller managed just 26, sealing his third Wooden Spoon despite that brilliant second-round 41. Williams closed on 145 points and 128 over par. His wire-to-wire Trophy victory masked the most volatile winning performance in modern TEG history.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Williams claimed his second TEG Trophy through sheer force of will over Spanish championship courses. His 48-point opening round established control he never relinquished across 72 holes, though the final 18 tested that resolve to breaking point. Eight blow-ups in the closing round produced just 28 points, yet the nine-point cushion built earlier proved enough. Baker closed within three points despite his own struggles, finishing runner-up in both competitions for the second time in his career.

Mullin secured his record fourth Green Jacket with characteristic consistency when others faltered. Leading the Gross competition through 62 of 72 holes, he weathered Baker's third-round charge and final-day chaos to win by four strokes. The Jacket victory came despite finishing fourth in Stableford, highlighting the divergent paths to success in TEG's dual formats. For the third consecutive tournament, Trophy and Jacket split between different winners.

Meller's week epitomised the volatility that defined Catalonia. His second-round 41 points topped all performances, yet 15 blow-ups across the week secured his third Wooden Spoon. The tournament's 53 triple-bogeys or worse established a new record for scoring carnage. Williams and Meller combined for 36 of those disasters, battling opposite ends of the leaderboard with equal difficulty.

Baker's dual runner-up finishes told the story of a champion denied. Within touching distance of history in both formats, costly blow-ups at crucial moments prevented the sweep. His sextuple-bogey ten at the ninth in Round 4, arriving precisely when both leads were within reach, crystallised a week of near misses. Spain's finest courses had delivered their verdict with brutal clarity.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

The 53 triple-bogeys or worse established a new TEG record for scoring volatility, with Williams accounting for 21, Meller 15, Baker nine, Neumann eight, and Mullin seven. Williams's 20-point Stableford swing between rounds one and four represented the widest range in tournament history. His 21-stroke Gross range from 20 over to 41 over proved equally extreme.

Mullin's fourth Green Jacket broke the previous record of three, establishing clear dominance in Gross competition. Williams managed just three birdies across 72 holes, remarkably capturing two at par threes. His birdie at the par-three 11th in Round 1 and another at the par-three 17th in Round 2 provided rare scoring highlights in an otherwise turbulent week.

The tournament marked Catalonia's debut on the TEG calendar. PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course, ranked fifth in Continental Europe and first in Spain, proved the most demanding test. Costa Brava's contrasting nines delivered the highest single-round score in Meller's 41 points, while El Prat's Rosa Course hosted the dramatic third-round Jacket lead change.
