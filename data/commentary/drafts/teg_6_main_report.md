## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams claimed his maiden Trophy with a wire-to-wire triumph, leading all 72 holes before edging Jon Baker by three points. Yet his coronation was anything but serene. Williams posted the tournament's worst round on Sunday, a six-blow-up disaster that left Baker within striking distance until the final holes. David Mullin provided the perfect counterpoint, dominating the Gross competition for 62 holes en route to his fourth Green Jacket but finishing a distant fourth in Stableford.

The inaugural Catalan expedition exposed every player's frailties. Fifty-two blow-ups across the field painted a picture of sustained struggle on Spain's finest layouts. Henry Meller's nightmare culminated in a Wooden Spoon, his final two rounds yielding 12 combined disasters including a pair of tens. Baker's agonising double runner-up finish typified a week of near misses and dramatic reversals, where competence and chaos traded places with alarming frequency.

## Round 1: Williams seizes command amid early chaos {.round1 .round}

The Tour course at PGA Catalunya provided a stern opening examination on a crisp Catalan morning. Warm sunshine belied the challenge awaiting on Angel Gallardo's parkland design. Early lead changes rippled through the field before Williams imposed order.

Jon Baker's opening hole set the tone. A seven at the par four dropped him into early trouble. David Mullin and Williams traded the Jacket lead at the second before Williams blew up himself at the third, carding a seven. Baker added another triple bogey at the fourth. Stuart Neumann recorded a quintuple bogey at the ninth, one of three players to reach nine or worse that day.

Williams found his rhythm from the ninth. A birdie at the 11th ignited a sublime stretch. He collected five points at the 14th with another birdie, then four points at the 15th. Twenty-two points across six holes established a commanding advantage. Baker salvaged a birdie at the 17th but the damage was done.

Williams closed with 48 points and a nine-point cushion, equalling a personal best. Baker's 39 points left him runner-up despite two disasters. Mullin's 37 points masked his one-stroke Gross lead. The foundations were laid.

## Round 2: Meller's brief renaissance amid Williams's struggles {.round2 .round}

Costa Brava's woodland parkland presented a different challenge. The technical front nine gave way to a more forgiving back nine. Williams's lead looked vulnerable as his game unravelled. Meller sensed an opportunity.

Williams recorded six blow-ups across his round, including four in succession from the second. An eight at the par five second, followed by a six at the third, established an ominous pattern. The seventh brought another eight, starting a dismal stretch. Doubles at the 14th, 15th and 16th completed the carnage. Yet somehow he carded 36 points, matching Baker who also endured two disasters.

Meller conjured his finest round of the week. Forty-one points represented genuine excellence. Four points at the 12th anchored a steady display. Level par from the ninth through 11th showcased composure rarely glimpsed in his remaining rounds. He climbed to within 14 points of Williams.

Mullin extended his Gross lead to six strokes despite an unremarkable 37 points. The dual competitions were diverging dramatically. Williams maintained his nine-point Trophy cushion, weathering the storm through sheer accumulated advantage.

## Round 3: Jacket lead changes hands as Meller implodes {.round3 .round}

Greg Norman's Rosa course at Real Club de Golf El Prat provided a prestige setting. Spain's 13th-ranked layout would witness extraordinary drama. Meller's tournament collapsed in spectacular fashion. Baker mounted his most serious challenge.

Meller's opening hole produced a ten, five over par. Zero points registered. The seventh brought another blow-up, then the eighth yielded a second ten, this time six over. Eleven strokes lost on two holes. His campaign disintegrated entirely. The Wooden Spoon loomed.

Baker and Williams both recorded horrors at the seventh, Jon posting a nine to Gregg's eight. The eighth brought Jon another nine. Yet Baker recovered magnificently. His back nine surge brought 20 points, closing the Trophy gap to seven.

The 18th hole proved pivotal for the Jacket. Mullin's blow-up, a nine at the par five, coincided with Baker's regulation par. Jon seized the Gross lead with one round remaining. Neumann's 36 points topped the round but mattered little in the broader narrative.

Williams's 33 points maintained control without conviction. His advantage looked increasingly fragile heading to the Stadium course finale.

## Round 4: Seven lead changes crown chaotic finale {.round4 .round}

The Stadium course at PGA Catalunya, Spain's premier layout and fifth-ranked in Continental Europe, would determine everything. Seven lead changes across both competitions ensured breathless confusion. Williams's nightmare round threatened to derail his entire week.

Meller opened with his third ten of the tournament, a five-over horror at the first. Williams blew up at the third, Neumann recorded another ten at the same hole. The sixth brought Williams an eight. At the seventh, a par five, Williams posted a nine and lost the Trophy lead for the first time since Thursday afternoon. Baker held it briefly.

Then came the ninth. Baker's ten, six over par, represented the defining moment. Mullin took the Jacket lead simultaneously. Neither would relinquish it. Williams regained the Trophy advantage at the tenth and defended desperately thereafter.

Williams recorded eight-over for holes six through eight. His front nine yielded just 10 points. Six blow-ups in total dotted his card. Yet Baker's late faltering, including an eight at the 18th, allowed Gregg to cling on. Three points separated them at the death.

Mullin's steadier closing 33 points and 22-over gross secured the Jacket by four strokes. His Gross mastery contrasted starkly with fourth place in Stableford.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Williams claimed his first Trophy through sustained excellence and final-round survival. Leading every single hole across four days should denote dominance. Yet his 28-point Sunday horror exposed the tournament's essential truth: this was attrition warfare, where victory belonged to whoever collapsed least dramatically. Baker's double runner-up agony highlighted this perfectly. Three points and four strokes separated him from a sweep he never quite achieved.

Mullin's fourth Green Jacket arrived through relentless Gross accumulation. Sixty-two holes leading the competition told its own story. That he finished 10 points behind Williams in Stableford emphasised the diverging priorities. His worst-ever round, a 29-over third round, threatened his Jacket before Sunday's steadier display restored order.

Fifty-two blow-ups across five players defined the week. Meller's 12 disasters, including three scores of ten or worse, secured the Spoon with grim inevitability. His collapse from Thursday's competent 31 points through weekend horrors of 25 and 26 points represented the tournament's most precipitous decline. Neumann finished third in both competitions through sheer consistency, never leading either but avoiding the worst excesses.

Catalonia's championship courses extracted their toll with surgical precision. Williams's wire-to-wire triumph, sealed by the narrowest margin despite his commanding early advantage, encapsulated a week where competence proved fleeting and chaos reigned supreme.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Gregg Williams (1st):** Maiden Trophy secured through relentless front-running and Sunday survival. Led all 72 holes yet posted the week's worst round when it mattered most. Seven blow-ups, including six on the final day, nearly cost him everything. Opened with a personal-best 48 points that created an insurmountable cushion.

**Jon Baker (T2 Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Agonising double near-miss defined by catastrophic blow-ups at decisive moments. The ninth hole Sunday, a ten costing six strokes, surrendered the Jacket lead permanently. Eight disasters across the week, including three scores of nine or worse, undermined otherwise solid scoring. Three points shy of the Trophy, four strokes off the Jacket.

**Stuart Neumann (3rd):** Consistent mediocrity proved its value. Third in both competitions through steady accumulation. Led Sunday's round with 36 points. Eight blow-ups evenly distributed prevented genuine challenges for either title. Never held a lead in 72 holes but avoided the extremes that claimed others.

**David Mullin (4th Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Fourth Green Jacket secured through Gross mastery despite Stableford mediocrity. Led the Jacket for 62 holes, surrendering it briefly Saturday before reclaiming it Sunday at the ninth. Personal-worst 29-over third round threatened disaster. Finished 10 points behind Williams in Stableford, illustrating the dual competition's diverging demands.

**Henry Meller (5th):** Wooden Spoon secured through systematic collapse. Twelve blow-ups included three scores of ten, two at five over and one at six over. Thursday's respectable 31 points gave way to Friday's excellent 41 before weekend implosion. Twenty-five and 26 points across the final two rounds featured horror shows at Saturday's first and eighth, plus Sunday's opening hole nightmare.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Williams's 48-point opening round equalled the highest Stableford score in TEG history. His subsequent rounds of 36, 33 and 28 illustrated declining form salvaged by Thursday's excellence. Baker's 20-over par final round gross total matched his opening 18, yet his Stableford returns declined from 39 to 32 points. Meller's 12 blow-ups across 72 holes represented the tournament's highest individual disaster count, with Williams and Baker recording seven and eight respectively. The 52 combined blow-ups averaged 10.4 per player, reflecting Catalonia's stern examination.
