## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Henry Meller claimed his maiden TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire triumph that left every rival trailing in his wake across Portugal's Lisbon Coast. The 175-point performance never faltered. Meller led every single hole over four rounds, securing victory by five points and turning two previous Wooden Spoons into silverware. David Mullin took his fifth Green Jacket after an intense duel with Meller that featured eight lead changes before Mullin's superior consistency delivered a 15-stroke margin.

Praia D'El Rey provided the spectacular setting for Rounds One and Four, its clifftop links holes framing the drama. The contest split sharply after the opening round. Meller's Stableford dominance never wavered whilst Mullin gradually assumed Gross control. Gregg Williams tied for second in the Trophy alongside Mullin despite wildly erratic scoring. Jon Baker's title defence imploded spectacularly when an 11 at the tenth in Round Four destroyed his challenge.

Alex Baker collected his first Wooden Spoon, finishing 23 points adrift of fifth place after a catalogue of blow-ups punctured his challenge from the opening hole.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Praia D'El Rey {.round1 .round}

The tournament began under Atlantic skies at Praia D'El Rey's spectacular links-parkland hybrid, where fortunes turned sharply on the opening two holes. Jon Baker birdied the par-five first to seize both competitions. Then came the par-three second. Baker posted seven. The Jacket and Trophy leads vanished instantly.

Henry Meller emerged from the chaos. He took the Trophy lead at the first and never relinquished it again. The advantage changed hands repeatedly through the early holes as David Mullin's birdie at the fifth briefly grabbed the Gross lead. Baker battled back with a birdie at the sixth to reclaim the Trophy. Meller responded immediately, launching a decisive surge from the ninth.

His brilliance peaked through holes nine to 14 where he gathered 19 points across six holes. A four-pointer at the 14th secured the Jacket lead. Baker had taken it at the 12th but couldn't hold on. Meller wobbled only at the eighth, posting nine. That brief lapse handed Baker and Mullin a share of the Trophy lead for one hole. Otherwise, Meller was imperious.

Alex Baker's round disintegrated under five blow-ups. He posted eight at the first, another eight at the fifth, seven at the sixth, eight at the tenth, and another eight at the 14th. Thirty-six points told a grim tale. Williams suffered too, carding eight at the sixth as the course exacted a fierce toll. Baker claimed the Jacket lead by one stroke over Meller, but the Stableford picture already looked ominous.

## Round 2: Meller Breaks Clear at Bom Sucesso {.round2 .round}

Donald Steel's parkland challenge at Bom Sucesso witnessed Meller extend his Trophy command to double figures whilst the Jacket race tightened into a two-player duel. The front nine set the tone. Meller birdied the par-five seventh to anchor an extraordinary hot spell, gathering 20 points across holes four to nine. He took the Jacket lead at the 12th with a four-pointer.

David Mullin produced the round of the tournament. His 46 points and nine-over gross claimed the Gross lead outright and moved him to within ten points of Meller in the Stableford. A birdie at the seventh matched Meller's excellence through the stretch. Mullin's front nine yielded 27 points; the back nine 19. The pattern would repeat.

Stuart Neumann quietly excelled. His 49-point round featured birdies at the first and tenth, placing him second for the day. Baker held second place in both competitions but the margin had grown. Williams endured a torrid afternoon. Four blow-ups included nine at the 15th, part of a back-nine collapse. He posted 38 points.

Alex Baker managed 42 points but required four more blow-ups to get there. The eighth at the first started another painful day. Another seven at the 14th and the 15th added to mounting misery. Neumann wobbled late too, posting seven at the 18th to surrender momentum. Baker's Jacket hopes evaporated as Mullin seized control.

## Round 3: Meller Holds Firm at Royal Óbidos {.round3 .round}

Seve Ballesteros's final design brought drama and pain in equal measure as Meller maintained his Trophy stranglehold whilst Mullin protected a fragile two-stroke Jacket advantage. The lead changed three times. Mullin briefly lost it. Twice. His birdie at the third snatched the Gross lead, only to surrender it at the fourth. Then came the 15th.

David Mullin posted eight for five over. No points. Henry Meller retook the Jacket lead with a four-pointer at the 14th. Mullin fought back instantly, regaining control at the 16th. Meller's blow-up at the 17th, a seven for three over, sealed the matter. Mullin held a two-stroke cushion entering the final day.

The Trophy race stretched further. Meller's 37 points extended his lead to 12 as rivals faltered. Jon Baker's title defence crumbled spectacularly. A ten at the par-five second for five over. A seven at the third for four over. Two holes, no points, and 11 wasted strokes. He tumbled from second to third. Stuart Neumann suffered his own nightmare, posting eight at the 11th and nine at the 12th for eight over across two holes.

Gregg Williams surged despite chaos. His birdie at the eighth sparked a 19-point haul across holes seven to 12. Then came 13 and 14. Six at the 13th, nine at the 14th. Eight over, no points. The contradiction defined his tournament. Alex Baker posted 36 points as blow-ups continued. Meller's lead appeared unassailable.

## Round 4: Coronations and Catastrophes at Praia D'El Rey {.round4 .round}

The return to Praia D'El Rey brought contrasting emotions as Meller cruised to his maiden Trophy whilst Mullin sealed his fifth Jacket with a commanding late surge. The opening holes delivered immediate carnage. Jon Baker posted seven at the first for three over. No points. Alex Baker matched it. Seven at the first, seven at the third. The pattern held.

Jon Baker's implosion at the tenth entered tournament folklore. Eleven strokes, six over par, zero points. The quintuple bogey destroyed any lingering hopes of catching Meller. A seven at the 11th for four over completed a nightmarish stretch. Nine to 11 produced 11 over across three holes. Baker posted 41 points but tumbled to fifth.

David Mullin responded with authority. His birdie at the 11th answered the pressure of an eight at the tenth. Clinical consistency through holes four to nine kept Meller at bay. Then came the decisive moment. A five-point birdie at the 17th sealed the Jacket with 15 strokes to spare. Mullin's 45 points and ten-over gross claimed the round's Gross honours.

Gregg Williams and Stuart Neumann shared the Stableford honours with 48 points apiece. Williams posted his best Gross round, 20 over, to tie for second in the Trophy. Neumann collected two birdies at the second and seventh, cementing second in the Jacket. Meller's 38 points sufficed for victory. He wobbled at the sixth and ninth, posting seven and eight. The 18th brought another seven. None of it mattered.

Alex Baker's tournament ended with a whimper. Nine at the sixth for five over. Nine at the 16th for another five over. Seven at the 18th for three over. His lone highlight arrived at the 14th: a birdie for five points, the only one on the back nine. He finished 23 points behind fifth place.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Henry Meller's triumph rewrote his TEG narrative completely. Two previous Wooden Spoons became distant memories as he led every single hole across 72 played, securing the Trophy by five points over Mullin and Williams. The 175-point total never looked threatened. Meller held the lead from the opening hole at Praia D'El Rey and extended it methodically through Bom Sucesso and Royal Óbidos before closing out victory on the Lisbon Coast.

David Mullin claimed his fifth Green Jacket after an intense battle that featured eight lead changes before his superior consistency prevailed. His Round Two nine-over set a new TEG record. Mullin's 15-stroke margin over Stuart Neumann reflected his ability to recover from blow-ups, notably the eight at the tenth in Round Four, with immediate birdies. Neumann quietly collected second in the Jacket with five birdies across the tournament, more than any other player.

Gregg Williams tied for second in the Trophy despite wildly erratic scoring that mixed brilliance with catastrophe. His 48-point final round salvaged a share of the runners-up spot alongside Mullin. Jon Baker's title defence collapsed dramatically. The catastrophic 11 at the tenth in Round Four epitomised a tournament that began with promise but disintegrated into a sequence of blow-ups. He finished fifth.

Alex Baker endured a torrid debut, collecting his first Wooden Spoon after finishing 23 points behind fifth place. His tournament featured 13 blow-ups of seven or higher, including five across the opening two rounds. One bright moment arrived with a birdie at the 14th in Round Four, but it couldn't offset the accumulated damage. Meller's redemption arc stood complete: from back-to-back Spoons to maiden Trophy winner.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Henry Meller's 175-point total ranks as the second-highest Trophy score in Lisbon Coast competition. His wire-to-wire dominance marked only the second time in TEG history a player has led every hole across four rounds. David Mullin's +9 Gross round at Bom Sucesso bettered the previous TEG record by two strokes, showcasing remarkable consistency on a course that punished others severely.

Gregg Williams's 48-point final round matched Stuart Neumann's effort and represented the joint-highest Stableford score of Round Four. Jon Baker's quintuple bogey at the tenth in Round Four stands as one of the worst single-hole collapses in TEG history. Alex Baker's 13 blow-ups across four rounds placed him firmly at the bottom of the field despite occasional flashes of competence.

Stuart Neumann's five birdies led the tournament, with David Mullin's five matching that total. Henry Meller managed just one birdie en route to Trophy glory, demonstrating that consistency trumped brilliance in Stableford. Praia D'El Rey's clifftop links holes yielded the tournament's most dramatic moments, hosting both opening and closing rounds.
