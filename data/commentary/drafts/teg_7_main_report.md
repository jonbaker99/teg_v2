## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Henry Meller secured his maiden Trophy with a performance of metronomic precision, leading all 72 holes from start to finish. The 175-point total, built across four new Portuguese courses, delivered victory by five points over joint runners-up David Mullin and Gregg Williams. Mullin claimed his fifth Green Jacket with a historic plus-53 gross performance, fifteen strokes clear of the field. The dramatic coastal setting of Praia D'El Rey provided a spectacular backdrop for both opening and closing rounds.

Meller's triumph ends a three-tournament Spoon streak with emphatic authority. He never trailed. The battle for second proved tighter than the winner's march, Mullin and Williams finishing dead-level on 170 points. Alex Baker's debut yielded 152 points and the Spoon, 23 behind fifth place after a brutal final round featuring three quintuple bogeys.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Praia D'El Rey {.round1 .round}

The tournament began on Cabell Robinson's coastal masterpiece, where dramatic dunes frame the back nine. Early lead changes peppered the front nine as players adjusted to unfamiliar terrain. Jon Baker opened with a birdie at the first but immediately surrendered both competitions after a seven at the par-three second.

Meller seized the Trophy lead at the fifth and never relinquished it. His spell from the ninth through fourteenth yielded nineteen Stableford points, anchored by a four-pointer at the fourteenth that also claimed the Jacket lead. Baker responded through the middle holes, reclaiming the Jacket temporarily with a birdie at the twelfth.

Alex Baker's debut featured three blow-ups within fourteen holes. An eight at the fifth preceded another at the tenth, then a third at the fourteenth. David Mullin looked dangerous early but took eight at the eighteenth to close. The round concluded with Meller two points clear of Baker in the Trophy race, while Baker held a slender one-stroke Jacket advantage.

## Round 2: Fireworks at Bom Sucesso {.round2 .round}

Donald Steel's contrasting design produced the tournament's most explosive round. Three players posted personal bests, yet Meller's 51-point masterclass extended his Trophy cushion to ten. The flat opening nine transitioned to dramatic hillside holes with lagoon vistas. Baker briefly threatened at the second hole but Meller's response proved devastating.

The leader reeled off nineteen points across six holes from the second through seventh, including a five-point birdie at the seventh that delivered the Jacket lead. Stuart Neumann posted 49 points in his finest TEG display. Mullin's plus-nine gross round set the all-time tournament record, overtaking the Jacket lead at the fifteenth after Jon Baker took seven there.

Gregg Williams endured a nightmare finish. A quintuple bogey at the fifteenth followed triple bogeys at the fourteenth and seventh. Alex Baker achieved a personal-best 42 points despite opening with an eight at the first. The par-four fourteenth claimed multiple victims: three triple bogeys recorded as players navigated the back nine.

Meller's dominance now spanned both competitions. His combined 100 points and plus-22 gross after 36 holes represented a commanding position. Mullin trailed by thirteen Trophy points but led the Jacket by three strokes.

## Round 3: Royal Óbidos Tests Resolve {.round3 .round}

Seve Ballesteros' final design presented a stern championship test with dramatic water hazards. Meller's Trophy cushion grew to twelve points despite a ragged finish. His four-pointer at the fourteenth briefly delivered the Jacket lead, but consecutive blow-ups at the fifteenth and seventeenth handed control back to Mullin.

Jon Baker's round unraveled spectacularly at the second and third holes. A ten at the par-five second preceded a seven at the par-three third. The early carnage dropped him from second to third in the Trophy standings. Williams mounted a charge with a birdie at the eighth and four points at the ninth, only to take nine at the fourteenth.

Mullin's consistency on the front nine built a nine-point cushion. His birdie at the third briefly threatened Meller's Jacket position. An eight at the fifteenth caused momentary panic, but he regained the lead at the sixteenth. Neumann's nine at the twelfth derailed his challenge, offset only partially by a birdie at the thirteenth.

Through 54 holes, Meller's Trophy advantage appeared unassailable. Mullin and Williams tied for second on 127 points, twelve behind. The Jacket battle remained Mullin's property at plus-53, with Meller fourteen strokes adrift.

## Round 4: Meller Holds Firm Despite Wobbles {.round4 .round}

Returning to Praia D'El Rey for the finale, Meller faced his sternest test. Williams and Neumann shared the round honours with 48 points apiece, but Meller's 38-point closing effort secured the Trophy by five. The leader stumbled twice: a triple bogey at the sixth preceded a card-wrecker at the ninth where he took eight.

Jon Baker suffered catastrophic damage at the tenth. His sextuple bogey featured eleven gross strokes. The blow-up followed a triple bogey at the opening hole and preceded another four-over at the eleventh. Williams' late charge proved too little, his 48 points closing the gap but falling short.

Alex Baker's nightmare finale featured three quintuple bogeys. Nines arrived at the sixth and sixteenth, with a seven at the third completing the carnage. His solitary bright moment came at the fourteenth: a birdie worth five points. Mullin closed with authority, posting plus-ten gross including birdies at the eleventh and seventeenth to seal his fifth Jacket by fifteen strokes.

The final standings confirmed Meller's historic wire-to-wire triumph. Mullin and Williams dead-heated for second on 170 points. Neumann claimed fourth at 169, while Jon Baker's 164 secured fifth. Alex Baker's debut concluded 23 points adrift of the next finisher.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Meller's maiden Trophy arrived via the most commanding route possible. Leading all 72 holes without a single lapse represents a TEG first since comprehensive tracking began. His consistency across four unfamiliar layouts demonstrated maturity and patience, qualities that eluded him during his previous three-Spoon run. The five-point victory margin understates his control: twelve points clear entering the final round, he managed the pressure with composure.

Mullin's fifth Jacket showcased his remarkable gross prowess. The plus-53 total obliterated the field by fifteen strokes, yet Trophy success remained elusive. His fifteen-point deficit in the Stableford competition highlights the contrasting demands of each format. The joint second-place finish with Williams at 170 points produced the tightest runner-up battle in tournament history.

Williams' late surge to share second represented his finest TEG performance. Neumann's fourth-place finish at 169 points, featuring five tournament-leading birdies, marked career-best territory. Jon Baker's fifth place masked a turbulent week: early Jacket leadership gave way to devastating blow-ups, including that sextuple bogey in the finale.

Alex Baker's debut yielded harsh lessons. Three quintuple bogeys in the final round punctuated a tournament featuring eight zero-point holes. The 152-point total, 23 behind fifth place, reflects the unforgiving nature of Stableford scoring when disaster strikes. One birdie across 72 holes tells its own story. Meller's redemption narrative proves that TEG fortunes can reverse dramatically. From three consecutive Spoons to wire-to-wire dominance: the perfect riposte.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Henry MELLER (1st):** Maiden Trophy secured with metronomic precision. Led all 72 holes in the only such performance on record. His 175 points featured consistent scoring across all four rounds, anchored by a personal-best 51-point explosion in Round 2. Despite wobbles in the finale, maintained a five-point cushion to end his three-Spoon streak emphatically.

**David MULLIN (T2):** Fifth Jacket arrived via historic plus-53 gross performance, fifteen strokes clear. His plus-nine Round 2 set the all-time tournament record. Dead-heated with Williams for Trophy runner-up at 170 points, unable to convert Jacket dominance into Stableford success. Three birdies in the final round underlined his class.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (T2):** Career-best finish at 170 points, sharing second with Mullin. His 48-point finale represented the week's joint-best round alongside Neumann. Five tournament birdies demonstrated quality amid inconsistency. Struggled mid-tournament with a quintuple bogey in Round 2 and a nine at Royal Óbidos' fourteenth.

**Stuart NEUMANN (4th):** Fourth place at 169 points marked his finest TEG showing. Posted personal-best 49 points in Round 2 and joint-led the finale with 48. His five birdies topped the tournament leaderboard. A blow-up at Royal Óbidos' twelfth proved costly in the battle for the podium.

**Jon BAKER (5th):** Fifth place at 164 points reflected a tumultuous week. Led the Jacket after Round 1 before collapsing spectacularly: sextuple bogey at the finale's tenth hole compounded earlier carnage. Showed quality with opening birdie and periods of solid scoring, but lacked consistency when it mattered.

**Alex BAKER (6th):** Debut Spoon with 152 points, 23 behind fifth place. Three quintuple bogeys in the finale capped a brutal introduction featuring eight zero-point holes across the tournament. Managed a personal-best 42 points in Round 2 and recorded a solitary birdie at the final round's fourteenth. Harsh lessons learned on unfamiliar Portuguese terrain.
