# TEG 15: Lisbon Coast, 2022

Gregg Williams claimed his fourth Trophy and maiden Green Jacket in wire-to-wire fashion across four Portuguese courses—Estoril, West Cliffs, Penha Longa, and Oitavos Dunes. He seized both leads by Round 1 Hole 4 after Jon Baker's early implosion and never looked back, opening a 9-point cushion after Round 2 before extending to a commanding 21-point Trophy margin and 29-stroke Jacket cushion.

Stuart Neumann surged from fifth to second place despite a catastrophic quintuple bogey finish on H18—his 9/+5 meltdown capped chaotic final-hole carnage that saw five of six players record blow-ups. Jon Baker's tournament epitomized collapse: leading both competitions after H1, he suffered 13 disasters across 72 holes, including six car-crashes in seven holes during Round 1. David Mullin's lone eagle on H15 Round 2 couldn't overcome 12 total disasters.

Williams completed his career sweep—his first Green Jacket pairing with three previous Trophies—in a tournament of attrition featuring 61 total blow-ups. Alex Baker avoided his third Wooden Spoon despite 13 zero-point holes and tournament-worst +134 gross.
