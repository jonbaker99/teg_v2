# TEG 5: The Algarve Returns (2012)

Jon Baker claimed his second Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory in Portugal, holding off Gregg Williams by 3 points after a wild final-round battle. Baker led from Round 1, survived five lead changes on the closing day, and sealed the win with three birdies in four holes (H13-15). David Mullin dominated the gross competition for his fourth Green Jacket, leading all 72 holes with a crushing 54-stroke margin—yet earned his first Wooden Spoon by finishing last in Stableford (136 points).

Williams entered Round 4 ahead by a single point but collapsed spectacularly. After trading the lead five times with Baker through 13 holes, Williams' quintuple bogey on H16 ended his challenge. Stuart Neumann's Round 2 explosion—45 points including an 11-point birdie stretch (H8-10)—vaulted him from last place to fourth overall, the tournament's best round.

Mullin's paradox defined TEG 5: wire-to-wire Jacket dominance (+72) paired with last-place Trophy finish, 3 points behind fourth. The tournament featured 44 triple-bogeys-or-worse across 72 holes and zero Trophy lead changes after Round 2—despite five final-round swaps between Baker and Williams.
