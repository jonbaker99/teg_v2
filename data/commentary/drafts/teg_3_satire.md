## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Some sporting events unfold like psychological thrillers. Others resembled watching paint dry under laboratory conditions. TEG 3 belonged emphatically to the latter category. Jon Baker seized both leads on the opening hole, relinquished one four holes later, then conducted a 68-hole procession to inevitable coronation. The suspense was roughly equivalent to a general election exit poll reading "Conservative: 437 seats."

David Mullin executed a parallel demonstration of gross-score superiority that nobody particularly challenged. The field produced five birdies across 360 holes, suggesting either Boavista Golf Resort had been redesigned by Satan, or the concept of playing below par remained theoretical. Stuart Neumann's tournament concluded with a quintuple-bogey implosion on hole 17 that functioned as both competitive suicide and metaphor for the broader human condition.

This was golf as Kafka might have imagined it: inevitable, bureaucratic, and ending badly for nearly everyone.

## Round 1: The Theatre of Predetermined Operations {.round1 .round}

Boavista's opening hole is a par 4 that has hosted precisely one moment of genuine TEG drama. Baker produced four routine blows with a scoring iron, made par, collected three Stableford points, and assumed dual leadership of competitions he would largely never relinquish. What followed resembled less a sporting contest and more a controlled military operation against an opponent who'd forgotten to show up.

The carnage began at hole six, a par 3 that evidently contained some gravitational anomaly. Williams, Meller, and Baker all suffered simultaneous cognitive collapses, suggesting either coordinated ineptitude or localised temporal distortion. Four players manufactured triple-bogeys or worse. The scoring resembled a casualty list from the Somme.

Meller's round contained both tournament brilliance and psychological atrocity. His birdie at sixteen was immediately followed by a twelve-shot monstrosity at seventeen that violated several laws of probability. Eight over par on a single hole represents not misfortune but active participation in one's own destruction. Williams contributed five blow-ups, establishing volatility records that would stand throughout.

Baker closed 45 points clear of a field already displaying symptoms of existential surrender. Mullin held the gross lead despite having briefly misplaced it mid-round, like a man searching for spectacles currently perched on his forehead.

## Round 2: The Inevitability Intensifies {.round2 .round}

Boavista's front nine acquired reputation as Meller's personal theatre of redemption. His six-hole stretch from the fourth produced 18 points, including a proper birdie at five that suggested perhaps golf needn't be entirely catastrophic. This represented the tournament's sole sustained period of competence meeting intention.

Baker extended his Trophy advantage to eleven points through the methodical application of par golf. No fireworks. No drama. Just relentless accumulation of points whilst others volunteered for spectacular failure. His round resembled a corporate earnings call: predictable, slightly tedious, ultimately profitable.

Williams manufactured blow-ups at ten and eleven with such casual efficiency one suspected he'd scheduled them weeks prior. His back nine collapsed by seven points compared to the front, suggesting either strategic fatigue or active sabotage of his own interests. Mullin closed with consecutive disasters at seventeen and eighteen but retained the Jacket lead because nobody else particularly fancied challenging him.

The standings crystallised into their final configuration. Baker led everything that mattered. Mullin led the thing nobody was seriously contesting. The others occupied positions best described as "present but decorative."

## Round 3: The Formalities Continue {.round3 .round}

Round three opened with Meller apparently attempting performance art. His seven at the first, followed by a quintuple-bogey atrocity at the third, suggested someone testing the outer limits of scorecard infrastructure. Six points through six holes is less a golf round and more a cry for help rendered in numerical form.

Baker responded to his own blow-ups at two and five by manufacturing 18 points across the next six holes, because apparently even mediocrity contains gradations. His 45-point performance represented not excellence but adequate crisis management. The sixteen-point lead was now insurmountable barring literal kidnapping.

Williams contributed a 41-point round that somehow left him third despite Meller's front-nine implosion. Consistency at this level functions as relative virtue. Mullin's 14-over-par maintained his Jacket stranglehold through the elegant strategy of being less terrible than everyone else.

The birdie drought continued. Five through 54 holes. Boavista was either a masterpiece of course design or an elaborate practical joke at the field's expense. Possibly both.

## Round 4: The Catastrophe Arrives, Fashionably Late {.round4 .round}

Neumann arrived at the sixteenth tee holding second in the Jacket race, one birdie away from respectable tournament completion. He duly manufactured that birdie with professional competence, collecting four points and perhaps permitting himself one fleeting moment of satisfaction.

The seventeenth hole then reminded him that hope is essentially a malfunction of the imagination. Ten shots. Six over par. Zero points. The scorecard required archaeological excavation to locate precedent. One could pilot a small aircraft through the statistical crater left by that number. Neumann plummeted from Jacket contention to Wooden Spoon recipient in approximately seventeen minutes of psychological demolition.

Baker cruised home with 36 points, which in this context represented uncontested dominance. His seventeen-point margin was the largest in series history, achieved through the simple expedient of being first after hole one and never relinquishing leadership for 71 subsequent attempts. Mullin's twelve-stroke Jacket victory was equally untroubled, suggesting a man on holiday who occasionally remembered to play golf.

Williams contributed four more blow-ups because consistency demands commitment. Meller produced his usual paradox: moments of brilliance interspersed with acts of competitive self-harm.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Baker's coronation represented golf stripped to its essential bureaucracy: seize advantage, maintain advantage, ignore all subsequent developments. He led 72 of 72 Trophy holes and four gross holes, which mathematically represents perfection tempered by reality. No drama. No comeback narrative. Just methodical accumulation of points whilst others volunteered for spectacular failure.

Mullin's Jacket excellence was similarly uncontested, his worst round being 14 over par in a tournament where that qualified as domination. Five birdies across 360 holes suggested either course brutality or collective incompetence. Probably both. The field manufactured 44 triple-bogeys or worse, indicating either strategic ambition meeting physical limitation or mass psychological collapse rendered in statistical form.

Neumann's quintuple-bogey finale functions as tournament epitaph. One hole destroyed 71 holes of solid competence, which is both tragedy and farce performed simultaneously. Meller's four birdies and ten disasters captured the essential TEG paradox: hope and horror occupying identical postcodes.

This was golf as predetermined outcome. The opening hole decided everything; the subsequent 359 merely confirmed it. Kafka would have appreciated the inevitability. Beckett would have recognised the futility. The rest of us simply documented the wreckage.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (Trophy Winner):** Executed the most comprehensively dominant Trophy performance in series history through the radical strategy of being first after hole one and remaining first thereafter. Seventeen-point margin represents not excellence but adequate crisis management against a field volunteering for self-destruction. His 164 points came via methodical accumulation rather than brilliance, which is both criticism and compliment.

**David MULLIN (Jacket Winner, 2nd Trophy):** Conducted a parallel demonstration of gross-score superiority that nobody particularly challenged. Twelve-stroke margin achieved through consistency rather than fireworks. His worst round was 14 over par, which in this theatre of operations qualified as domination. Led 69 of 72 gross holes, suggesting a man on holiday who occasionally remembered to play golf.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd):** Contributed eleven blow-ups across 72 holes, establishing volatility records that may stand indefinitely. Five disasters in round one alone suggested either ambitious target-setting or active participation in one's own competitive demise. Finished 26 points behind Baker, which represents less a gap and more a philosophical chasm.

**Henry MELLER (4th):** Produced the tournament's most vivid paradox: four birdies (tournament-high) paired with ten catastrophic blow-ups. His twelve-shot atrocity at round-one's seventeenth represents not misfortune but mathematical hate crime. The 18-point stretch in round two suggested competence was theoretically possible; the surrounding carnage proved it remained largely theoretical.

**Stuart NEUMANN (Wooden Spoon):** Conducted a solid if unspectacular tournament before hole seventeen's final round delivered a quintuple-bogey that functioned as both competitive suicide and existential commentary. One hole destroyed 71 holes of adequate work. The birdie immediately preceding this disaster makes the tragedy almost operatic. Sometimes golf is Shakespearean; sometimes it's just cruel.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**The Birdie Famine:** Five birdies across 360 holes represents a conversion rate of 1.39%, suggesting Boavista was designed either by genius or sadist. Meller manufactured four; Neumann contributed one immediately before his quintuple-bogey catastrophe. The course average hovered around double bogey, indicating either brutal design or collective incompetence. Possibly both.

**Blow-Up Epidemic:** Forty-four scores of triple-bogey or worse scattered across four rounds like landmines in a poorly-marked minefield. Williams led with eleven, suggesting either ambition or masochism. Hole seventeen claimed five victims in round one alone, establishing itself as the tournament's primary execution site.

**Front-Nine Dominance:** Mullin and Williams both scored five points higher on front nines than back, suggesting either strategic energy deployment or back-nine psychological collapse. Meller reversed this pattern in rounds three and four with seven-point swings, indicating either tactical adjustment or random variance masquerading as pattern.

**Lead Stability:** Zero lead changes after round one. Baker held Trophy leadership for 72 consecutive holes; Mullin held Jacket for 69 of 72. This represents either dominance or boring inevitability depending on one's tolerance for suspense. The tournament resembled a predetermined outcome with decorative interludes.

**Statistical Carnage:** Williams posted a 1.24 standard deviation per hole, the tournament's most erratic performance. His round scores ranged from 31 to 41 points, suggesting a man experimenting with multiple personality disorder via scorecard. The consistency was consistently inconsistent.
