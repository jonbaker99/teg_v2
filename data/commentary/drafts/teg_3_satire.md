# TEG 3: Jon Baker's 72-Hole Coronation, A Study in Zero Drama {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 3 | Algarve | 2010</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker achieved something approaching golfing perfection at Boavista, which is to say he led all 72 holes and won by 17 points. This is the competitive equivalent of turning up to a knife fight with a tank. David Mullin claimed the Green Jacket with similar ruthless efficiency, his 12-stroke margin suggesting less a contest than a polite formality. The birdie famine of epic proportion suggests five men spending four days in a state of collective cognitive meltdown. Only five birdies across 360 holes. The Atlantic Ocean provided stunning views while men committed acts of scorecard violence against themselves with impressive consistency.

Stuart Neumann's quintuple bogey on the 17th hole of Round 4 represents the tournament's defining moment: a brief flash of brilliance on the preceding hole followed by complete structural collapse. Henry Meller recorded four birdies yet finished fourth, which tells you everything about the volatility on display.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon Baker (Trophy Winner):** Led from the first hole to the 72nd, extending his advantage each round with the methodical efficiency of a man dismantling furniture. His wire-to-wire dominance never wavered despite losing the Jacket lead early, suggesting a man who knew exactly which competition he was entering. Two blow-ups across 72 holes represents discipline bordering on the sociopathic.

**David Mullin (Green Jacket Winner):** Held the gross lead for 69 of 72 holes, his worst score a perfectly respectable +14 in Round 3. The 12-stroke margin of victory suggests he was playing a different sport to the rest of the field. Three blow-ups all tournament, two of them occurring in the same closing stretch of Round 2 when the outcome was already settled.

**Gregg Williams (3rd):** Recorded 11 blow-ups across four rounds, his standard deviation of 1.24 points per hole making him the tournament's most volatile performer. Strong front-nine performances repeatedly undermined by back-nine carnage. Think Icarus, but with multiple opportunities to learn from his mistakes.

**Henry Meller (4th):** Four birdies, 10 blow-ups. The man exists in a state of permanent psychological whiplash. Round 3's consecutive birdies on 11 and 12 came immediately after a quintuple bogey on the 3rd, suggesting a relationship with consistency that could generously be described as hostile.

**Stuart Neumann (Wooden Spoon):** One birdie on the 16th hole of Round 4, immediately followed by a quintuple bogey that dropped him from contention to catastrophe. The scorecard for that 17th hole should be framed as a warning to future generations.

## Round 1: The Establishment of Natural Order {.round1 .round}

Jon Baker seized both leads on the opening hole with a par, the golfing equivalent of declaring your intentions at a dinner party. The Atlantic breeze carried the scent of optimism. It wouldn't last.

David Mullin briefly claimed the Trophy lead on the 6th, a Par 3 where four of the five competitors recorded blow-ups simultaneously, as if responding to some inaudible signal. Baker reclaimed both leads by the 7th, never to relinquish the Trophy again. Henry Meller's opening nine holes contained genuine promise: a birdie on 16 suggested competence. The 17th hole disagreed. A 12 ensued, eight over par, the sort of number that appears on scorecards and in nightmares. Gregg Williams recorded five blow-ups across 18 holes, his back nine collapsing like a badly constructed souffl√©. He bogeyed 17 and made an eight on 18, the finishing straight transformed into a theater of operations where hope went to die.

Baker's 45 points established an eight-point lead. Mullin's +17 gross claimed the Jacket. The field scattered behind them like refugees from a minor conflict.

## Round 2: The Inexorable Widening {.round2 .round}

Baker extended his lead to 11 points with another 45-point performance, the sort of scoring that transforms competition into procession. Henry Meller mounted a valiant challenge with 38 points, his best round. A birdie on the 5th sparkled briefly.

Meller's hot spell from holes 4 through 9 yielded 18 points, including consecutive four-point holes. This represents the tournament's single sustained period of competence. Naturally, it couldn't last. Williams recorded blow-ups on the 10th and 11th, his middle-round collapse becoming a signature move. His front-nine 21 points suggested promise. His back-nine 14 points suggested reality reasserting itself with prejudicial force.

Mullin's +21 gross included catastrophic blow-ups on 17 and 18, nines and sevens appearing where fours and fives belong. Even in dominance, the course demanded tribute. Baker's 38 points matched Meller's but he maintained the Trophy lead with ruthless efficiency. The Green Jacket remained Mullin's property, though his closing holes suggested vulnerability.

## Round 3: The Consolidation of Power {.round3 .round}

Baker posted another 45-point round, extending his Trophy lead to 16 points. This represents dominance bordering on the tyrannical. Mullin's 40 points and +14 gross solidified the Jacket position, his worst gross score of the tournament still comfortable enough to discourage challenges.

Meller's round contained the tournament's most schizophrenic stretch: a quintuple bogey on the Par 5 3rd, followed by consecutive birdies on the 11th and 12th. From 10 to back-to-back four-pointers inside four holes. This is what trauma looks like in Stableford format. Baker and Williams both recorded blow-ups on the 2nd, a Par 3 that claimed victims with democratic zeal. Baker suffered a quintuple on the 18th, his first serious blemish across 54 holes, though by then the outcome was academic.

Williams recorded 41 points, his best round, yet remained fourth in Trophy standings. The mathematics of futility. Neumann's 36 points kept him fifth, his solid play unremarked and unrewarded.

## Round 4: The Quintuple Catastrophe {.round4 .round}

Baker cruised home with 36 points, his victory margin of 17 points representing the most comprehensive Trophy performance in series history. The closing round resembled a coronation, albeit one conducted on a Portuguese parkland while men suffered various forms of numerical violence.

Stuart Neumann arrived at the 17th hole having just birdied the 16th. Four glorious points. Then came the 10, a quintuple bogey that represents this tournament's singular moment of pure tragedy. Six over par on a single hole. The Wooden Spoon was claimed not through sustained mediocrity but via one catastrophic act of self-administered trauma. Williams recorded four blow-ups including nines on the 3rd and 7th, his volatility reaching its natural conclusion. Meller and he both made eights on the 7th, synchronized suffering.

Mullin's 35 points and +20 gross secured the Green Jacket by 12 strokes, never threatened after the opening round. Baker, Mullin, and Williams all recorded opening-hole triple bogeys, as if the course demanded immediate sacrifice. The back nine saw Baker and Williams implode on 11, both recording blow-ups on the Par 3, while Neumann's birdie-then-quintuple sequence on 16-17 provided the tournament's defining narrative arc.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire Trophy victory represents the most complete individual performance in TEG history. He led all 72 holes from the first tee shot to the final putt, extending his advantage each round with mechanical precision. His 164 points finished 17 clear of David Mullin, whose own 147-point total would have won most tournaments but here served merely as supporting evidence of Baker's dominance.

Mullin's Green Jacket triumph proved equally comprehensive, leading 69 of 72 holes gross and winning by 12 strokes. His worst round, +14 in Round 3, would represent many players' best effort. The birdie famine of biblical proportions suggests five men existing in a state of sustained technical crisis: only five birdies across 360 holes, with Meller claiming four of them while still finishing fourth.

Stuart Neumann's quintuple bogey on the 17th hole of Round 4 provided the tournament's tragic centerpiece, a single catastrophic moment destroying an otherwise solid performance and earning him the Wooden Spoon. Gregg Williams recorded 11 blow-ups across 72 holes, his standard deviation of 1.24 points per hole making him the most volatile performer in a field not short on volatility. The Atlantic views remained stunning throughout. One assumes the ocean appreciated the irony of men struggling this magnificently while surrounded by such beauty.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Birdie Famine:** Only five birdies recorded across 360 holes (1.39% birdie rate). Henry Meller claimed four of them, his Round 1 birdie on 16 immediately followed by a 12 on 17. Stuart Neumann's lone birdie came on Round 4's 16th hole, one hole before his quintuple-bogey catastrophe. The universe maintains balance through cruelty.

**Blow-Up Epidemic:** 44 total scores of triple-bogey or worse were recorded, an average of 8.8 per player across 72 holes. Gregg Williams led with 11, followed by Henry Meller's 10. Jon Baker's two blow-ups across four rounds suggests either discipline or luck. Possibly both.

**Lead Changes:** Zero after Hole 7 of Round 1. Baker claimed both leads on the 1st hole, briefly lost them, reclaimed them by the 7th, and never relinquished the Trophy lead again. This represents competitive suspense at its absolute minimum.

**Front-Nine Dominance:** David Mullin averaged 20.75 points across front nines versus 15 points on back nines, a 5.75-point differential suggesting either morning person tendencies or structural collapse after lunch. Gregg Williams showed similar patterns until they stopped mattering.

**The H17 Par 4 Curse:** Round 4's 17th hole: Neumann's quintuple bogey, Williams' blow-up. Round 2's 17th: Mullin and Williams both recorded blow-ups. This hole demanded human sacrifice with disturbing regularity.

**Consistency Paradox:** Henry Meller recorded the tournament's highest birdie count (4) yet finished fourth, suggesting volatility as his defining characteristic. His 10 blow-ups canceled out four moments of brilliance, the golfing equivalent of one step forward, 2.5 steps backward.
