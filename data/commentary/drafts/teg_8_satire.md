# TEG 8: Gregg Williams Won Despite Twelve Acts of Self-Sabotage {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 8 | Lisbon Coast | 2015</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Gregg Williams led for 72 consecutive holes and won by 12 points, which sounds straightforward until you learn he experienced 12 separate nervous breakdowns during the process. David Mullin claimed his sixth Green Jacket despite finishing fourth in Stableford, proving once again that amateur golf operates on logic accessible only to those who've spent four days arguing with Portuguese pine trees. Jon Baker held the Jacket lead through 54 holes before surrendering it at the second hole of the final round, a capitulation so swift it barely qualified as resistance. Stuart Neumann collected his first Wooden Spoon after 23 blow-ups across four rounds, including a quintuple bogey or worse on Round 1's opening hole that announced his intentions with admirable clarity.

The tournament unfolded across four pristine courses along the Lisbon Coast, each offering unique opportunities for public humiliation. Williams never trailed, extending his lead from four points after Round 1 to 11 after Round 2, before maintaining enough composure through a catastrophic middle stretch to cruise home. The defining feature was watching two competitions diverge like estranged spouses, with the Trophy winner and Jacket winner sharing precisely nothing except geography and regret.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Gregg Williams (1st Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Led every single hole in Stableford scoring whilst experiencing the emotional stability of a man defusing bombs in the dark. Twelve blow-ups, including back-to-back quintuple bogeys on Round 3, yet never came close to relinquishing first place. A masterclass in domination despite clear evidence of ongoing psychological warfare with Par 5s.

**David Mullin (4th Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Seized the Jacket lead at Round 4's second hole and won by six strokes despite posting the fourth-best Stableford total. His sixth Jacket extends a record that looks increasingly like a deliberate campaign to corner the market. Four birdies, six blow-ups, and the kind of consistent net play that makes mockery of the Stableford scoring system.

**Jon Baker (3rd Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Held the Jacket lead through 54 holes with the confidence of a man who'd done the mathematics, then lost it at the 56th hole with the inevitability of a man who'd forgotten to carry a one. Finished runners-up in both competitions, which is either admirable consistency or a comprehensive failure to commit.

**Alex Baker (2nd Trophy, 6th Jacket):** Posted the tournament's second-best Stableford total despite 25 worse-than-double scores that read like a criminal record. Strong finisher in Round 4 with 39 points, but doomed by a gross score suggesting he'd played several holes with his eyes closed.

**Henry Meller (5th Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Suffered a catastrophic final-round front nine that featured eight points and four consecutive blow-ups from holes two through five. Finished watching others collect silverware whilst contemplating whether golf is really necessary.

**Stuart Neumann (6th Trophy, 6th Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Opened the tournament with a quintuple bogey or worse, then spent the next 71 holes confirming first impressions. Started the final round with a birdie in what appeared to be satire, before subsiding to a 49-point deficit. Twenty-three blow-ups across four rounds suggest a man committed to exploring the outer limits of what constitutes golf.

## Round 1: The Establishment of Predictable Hierarchies {.round1 .round}

Quinta da Marinha presented itself as a classic Robert Trent Jones Sr. design, which is golfing code for "elevated targets you won't reach and bunkers where you'll spend most of your afternoon." The field arrived at this pine-forested estate with varying levels of optimism, all of which would be comprehensively addressed over the next four hours.

Stuart Neumann opened proceedings with an eight on the Par 5 first hole, scoring zero Stableford points in a performance that functioned as both warning and prophecy. By the time the group reached the tenth, Alex Baker held a fragile Trophy lead that lasted precisely until Gregg Williams carded a birdie and Baker produced a nine. Williams seized first place with the efficiency of a man reclaiming stolen property. Jon Baker imploded on the 13th with a quintuple bogey that cost him the Jacket lead he'd been nurturing like a fragile seedling. David Mullin maintained steady progress at the top of the gross leaderboard, recording a birdie on the Par 3 second and generally behaving as though he'd read the course manual.

Williams posted 38 points to establish a four-point lead over Jon Baker, whilst Mullin led the Jacket by a single stroke. Neumann limped home with 17 points after adding blow-ups on the ninth, tenth, 11th, 12th, and 14th, a sequence suggesting profound disagreement with the concept of scoring. Alex Baker contributed three consecutive blow-ups to close his round, finishing with 30 points despite leading at the turn. Henry Meller recorded both a blow-up and a birdie within three holes, demonstrating the kind of volatility normally reserved for cryptocurrency markets.

## Round 2: The Consolidation of Suffering {.round2 .round}

Penha Longa's Atlantic Course climbed into the Sintra hills like a man fleeing reason, offering dramatic mountain terrain and the kind of elevation changes that make you question whether golf should involve sherpa support. Robert Trent Jones Jr. had designed something ranked 26th Best Value Course Worldwide, though "value" seems a curious descriptor for psychological torment at altitude.

Williams extended his lead to 11 points with a magnificent 41, including three separate four-point scores that suggested he'd found the instruction manual everyone else had misplaced. David Mullin posted the round's best gross score, carding a birdie on the Par 5 sixth and maintaining the Jacket lead with the calm of a man who'd already won this thing five times before. The 12th hole became a theater of collective disasters, with Williams, Meller, and Neumann all posting blow-ups in what appeared to be coordinated self-harm. Williams recorded a quintuple bogey or worse, scoring zero points in a moment that would have ended most Trophy challenges. He shrugged and maintained an 11-point cushion.

The 16th hole witnessed its own apocalypse, as four players posted blow-ups simultaneously. Williams scraped a single point. Jon Baker managed zero. Alex Baker and Neumann joined the carnage, whilst Meller added a blow-up on the 17th for good measure. Baker somehow emerged with 36 points despite the wreckage, moving into third place overall. Neumann posted 31 points from the ruins, which felt aspirational.

## Round 3: The Emergence of False Hope and Real Disasters {.round3 .round}

Back at Quinta da Marinha for the penultimate round, with Williams holding a commanding lead and the Jacket race tightening like a noose. The course sat waiting in the Portuguese sunshine, offering no clues about the violence to come.

Neumann opened with another blow-up on the first hole, a quintuple bogey that suggested he'd developed a personal vendetta against Par 5 opening holes specifically. Jon Baker posted a blow-up on the fourth before recovering to seize the Jacket lead at the 12th hole, overtaking Mullin with the confidence of a man who'd finally solved the puzzle. Alex Baker produced a six-over-par blow-up on the eighth that scored zero points, a number that perfectly captured its contribution to his ambitions. Williams appeared comfortable until the tenth, where he recorded a four-over blow-up, followed immediately by a quintuple bogey on the 11th. Back-to-back disasters that would have sunk lesser leads vanished into his 11-point cushion like pebbles into an ocean.

Baker finished with a birdie on the 17th, posting 35 points and maintaining the Jacket lead he'd seized mid-round. Williams limped home with 29 points, his worst round of the tournament, yet still held a five-point Trophy advantage. Mullin lost and regained the Jacket lead twice during the round before finishing third, one stroke behind. Neumann contributed 20 points after a third blow-up on the tenth, bringing his tournament total of scoreless holes to a number requiring scientific notation.

## Round 4: The Restoration of Predictable Outcomes {.round4 .round}

Oitavos Dunes, Portugal's premier golf course, presented itself for the finale. A pure links design along the Atlantic coast, ranked first in the country and 55th worldwide. The field arrived knowing that whatever happened next would be recorded for posterity, which proved unfortunate for several participants.

Neumann opened with a birdie, scoring four points in what appeared to be either satire or temporary insanity. The illusion lasted precisely one hole. Jon Baker lost the Jacket lead at the second hole with a triple bogey, surrendering to Mullin with the resistance of wet tissue paper. Mullin seized first place and never looked back, posting birdies on the 13th and 16th to seal his sixth Jacket by six strokes. Henry Meller recorded zero points from holes two through five, a four-hole sequence featuring four consecutive blow-ups that resembled a man systematically demolishing his own tournament. He posted eight points on the front nine, a score suggesting he'd played several holes whilst unconscious.

Williams cruised home with 41 points, matching his Round 2 performance and extending his final margin to 12 points. Alex Baker posted 39 points to claim second place, demonstrating that consistency in mediocrity eventually yields results. Baker finished with 28 points, watching Mullin collect the Jacket he'd held for 54 holes. Neumann contributed 32 points before collecting his Wooden Spoon with the dignity of a man who'd seen this coming since the first tee of Round 1.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Williams led for 72 consecutive holes whilst experiencing 12 separate blow-ups, a statistic that captures amateur golf's essential paradox: you can dominate whilst simultaneously falling apart. His 12-point margin represented the kind of comfortable victory that looks inevitable in retrospect, though watching him post back-to-back quintuple bogeys in Round 3 suggested otherwise at the time. Mullin claimed his sixth Green Jacket with the methodical precision of a man collecting stamps, winning by six strokes despite finishing fourth in Stableford. The divergence between competitions reached philosophical dimensions: the Trophy winner posted 149 Stableford points but finished third in gross scoring, whilst the Jacket winner posted 126 Stableford points but led the gross leaderboard by six strokes.

Jon Baker's collapse from the Jacket lead represented the tournament's most visceral drama, losing at the second hole of the final round after holding first place through 54 holes. Alex Baker finished second in the Trophy after posting 25 worse-than-double scores, proving that volume eventually overwhelms quality. Henry Meller's front nine in Round 4 featured eight points and four consecutive blow-ups, a sequence suggesting he'd confused golf with some other sport entirely. Neumann finished 49 points behind the winner despite opening Round 4 with a birdie, demonstrating that hope is just optimism meeting reality in a car park.

The Lisbon Coast courses provided pristine backdrops for comprehensive humiliation, from Quinta da Marinha's pine forests to Penha Longa's mountain drama to Oitavos Dunes' links perfection. Four new venues, four rounds of proof that changing location does nothing to alter fundamental incompetence. Williams collected his third Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance. Mullin added a sixth Jacket to his collection. And somewhere in the Portuguese sunshine, six men contemplated whether they'd actually enjoyed any of this, or were simply committed to the performance.
