# TEG 16: Stuart Neumann Finally Wins Something, 360 Holes Without an Eagle {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 16 | Lisbon Coast | 2023</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Across four Portuguese golf courses and 360 holes of voluntary psychological experimentation, TEG 16 delivered a case study in parallel universes. Stuart Neumann claimed his maiden Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance that never wavered, leading all 72 holes. Gregg Williams completed his own processional march to a second Green Jacket, also leading wire-to-wire but finishing runner-up in the Stableford. For the first time since TEG 12, the two competitions crowned different monarchs.

The tournament unfolded with the grim inevitability of a Greek tragedy performed by men with 24 handicaps. Ten birdies across 360 holes suggested either brutal course conditions or a collective abandonment of ambition. Zero eagles confirmed both. Alex Baker collected his third career Wooden Spoon with 13 scoreless holes, including a 12th-hole horror show in Round 3 that summarised his week. David Mullin's closing 45-point surge arrived too late to trouble Neumann's 13-point victory margin.

The Lisbon Coast provided the backdrop. Oitavos Dunes opened proceedings with its Atlantic winds. Troia's Robert Trent Jones Sr. design hosted Round 2. Penha Longa's mountain parkland delivered the defining H12 carnage in Round 3. Estoril's classic parkland closed the show.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Stuart Neumann (Winner, Trophy):** Secured his first Trophy with 156 points across four rounds of relentless competence, leading from H1 to H72 without once relinquishing control. His Round 3 blow-up on the 1st and Round 4's quintuple bogey on the 8th represented brief lapses in otherwise clinical execution. Finished fourth in the Jacket standings with +105 gross, proving that Stableford mastery requires consistency over brilliance.

**Gregg Williams (Winner, Green Jacket; Runner-up, Trophy):** Completed wire-to-wire Jacket dominance with +66 gross, 16 strokes clear of the field, yet finished 13 points behind Neumann in the Trophy race. His 143 Stableford points revealed the harsh arithmetic: gross excellence without conversion. A Round 5 birdie and mostly steady play couldn't overcome Neumann's superior scoring efficiency.

**David Mullin (3rd):** Produced the tournament's finest round with a closing 45-point masterpiece, including two birdies and an +11 gross performance. Too little, too late. His 142-point total fell 14 short of Neumann after earlier rounds failed to maintain contention. The man who could have been champion finished third.

**Jon Baker (4th):** Collected 131 points whilst navigating three momentary Jacket leads during Round 2, all immediately surrendered. His Round 3 quintuple bogey on H12 defined his tournament more than any birdie. Finished with +93 gross, which somehow felt optimistic.

**Alex Baker (Wooden Spoon):** Recorded 13 zero-point holes and 22 scores worse than double bogey en route to his third career Spoon. His H12 Round 3 quadruple and H12 Round 4 septuple bookended a week where hope arrived each morning and departed by the 6th. Finished 29 points behind the winner. The scorecards read like accident reports.

## Round 1: When Delusion Met Oitavos {.round1 .round}

Oitavos Dunes welcomed five men with varying degrees of self-belief onto its Atlantic-facing links. The wind arrived like an unwelcome dinner guest. Stuart Neumann seized the Trophy lead on the 1st hole and simply refused to let go for the next 71. Gregg Williams, Jon Baker, and David Mullin tied for the Gross lead with pars on the opening hole, establishing early credentials that would matter differently by Sunday.

Alex Baker opened with a quintuple bogey, scoring zero points and establishing a pattern that would define his tournament like a recurring nightmare. By H7, Neumann had suffered his first blow-up (triple bogey, one point) whilst Alex collected another zero on the same Par 5. The 8th hole claimed Mullin and Jon Baker with matching triple bogeys. By H10, Mullin added another triple. H11 delivered Alex his third blow-up in eleven holes.

The closing stretch resembled a disaster montage. H17 produced a sextuple bogey from Alex (zero points) and another triple from Neumann. The 18th collected four blow-ups: Alex, Mullin, Jon Baker, and Neumann all recording triples. Neumann led by five points despite three blow-ups of his own. Williams and Jon Baker tied for the Gross lead at +18, three shots clear.

## Round 2: Troia's Three-Birdie Renaissance {.round2 .round}

Troia's Robert Trent Jones Sr. design hosted Round 2 with the championship course's strategic demands. The front nine proceeded with mathematical grimness until H10 delivered the tournament's first genuine cause for celebration: three simultaneous birdies from Alex Baker, Jon Baker, and Stuart Neumann. It wouldn't last.

Alex suffered blow-ups on H2 and H4 (both Par 3s, both triple bogeys). Neumann joined him on H4's triple. Jon Baker's triple on H7 arrived amid a round where he briefly seized the Jacket lead on H11, lost it on H12, regained it on H14, and surrendered it again on H16. Williams never relinquished Trophy control.

The back nine descended into familiar patterns. Mullin and Neumann both tripled the 8th. H13 claimed Alex and Neumann with matching triples. Neumann's H16 quadruple represented his worst hole of the round but somehow extended his Trophy lead to seven points. H17 collected both Jon Baker and Neumann with triple bogeys. Neumann's 35 points cemented his dominance despite four blow-ups.

Williams posted 30 points and +22 gross, maintaining his Jacket lead with quiet competence. His front nine featured steady pars. His back nine avoided disasters. Sometimes golf rewards the absence of catastrophe.

## Round 3: Penha Longa's H12 Apocalypse {.round3 .round}

Penha Longa's mountain parkland delivered the tournament's defining moment on its 12th hole, where Jon Baker recorded a quintuple bogey that suggested existential collapse and Alex Baker added a quadruple that seemed almost sympathetic. Before the carnage, the round had proceeded with ominous normalcy.

Neumann opened with a quadruple on H1, surrendering zero points. Williams and Jon Baker both tripled the 3rd. Then came redemption: Williams birdied H5, Neumann birdied H6, and Jon Baker birdied H7 before Williams immediately tripled the same hole. The narrative lurched between competence and chaos.

H12 arrived like a reckoning. Jon Baker's 10 strokes represented five over par and zero Stableford points. Alex's nine strokes (four over) also scored zero. H13 added insult: Alex tripled, Jon Baker quadrupled. Neumann and Mullin both quadrupled H14. Mullin added a quadruple on H16 for symmetry. Neumann's 39-point round extended his Trophy lead to 12 points. Williams's 37 points and +15 gross strengthened his Jacket control despite three blow-ups.

The round ended with Williams demonstrating a strong back nine (22 points versus 15 on the front) whilst Alex and Jon Baker contemplated their H12 scorecards like archaeological evidence of poor decision-making.

## Round 4: Estoril's Closing Arithmetic {.round4 .round}

Estoril's classic parkland provided the stage for Mullin's magnificent 45-point finale and Neumann's comfortable coronation. The opener delivered immediate theatre: Alex Baker's quintuple bogey (zero points) contrasted with Neumann's birdie on H2 (five points) and Mullin's matching birdie (four points). The Trophy race ended before the turn.

Alex tripled the 3rd and quadrupled the 6th, establishing familiar patterns. Mullin birdied H7, his second of the day. Neumann's quintuple on H8 represented his only serious wobble, scoring zero points but arriving with a 12-point cushion. Jon Baker tripled H9 before birdieing H10, which summarised his tournament.

H11 saw Alex score four points (a personal triumph) whilst Jon Baker quadrupled. H12 delivered Alex's tournament-worst septuple bogey (11 strokes, zero points) whilst Neumann calmly collected four points. Williams quadrupled H14, his rarest mistake, but maintained Jacket dominance with +11 gross.

Mullin's 45 points (best round) and +11 gross (tied with Williams) secured first place for the day but second overall. Neumann's 43 points clinched the Trophy by 13. Williams completed wire-to-wire Jacket dominance by 16 strokes. Alex finished with a strong back nine (20 points versus 13 on the front), which felt like mockery.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Stuart Neumann claimed his maiden Trophy through 72 holes of unbroken leadership, extending his opening five-point margin to 13 by Sunday whilst never trailing. His 156 Stableford points represented consistent conversion across four rounds, demonstrating that wire-to-wire victories require sustained competence rather than moments of brilliance. Three birdies across 72 holes suggested efficient rather than spectacular golf.

Gregg Williams completed his own processional march to a second Green Jacket, leading all 72 gross holes and finishing 16 strokes clear with +66. His 143 Stableford points confirmed the harsh arithmetic: gross excellence without Stableford conversion leaves trophies on the table. His Round 3 back-nine surge (22 points) and consistent par golf throughout demonstrated technical superiority that somehow translated into second place.

David Mullin's closing 45-point masterpiece (tournament-best round, +11 gross) arrived too late to threaten Neumann's control but secured third place with 142 points. His two birdies and absence of blow-ups in Round 4 suggested what might have been. Jon Baker navigated three momentary Jacket leads in Round 2 before his Round 3 H12 quintuple defined his tournament.

Alex Baker's third career Wooden Spoon emerged from 13 zero-point holes, 22 scores worse than double bogey, and two H12 horrors (quadruple in Round 3, septuple in Round 4). Ten total birdies and zero eagles across 360 holes confirmed brutal scoring conditions or collective abandonment of ambition. Sixty-six blow-ups (triple bogey or worse) suggested the former. For the first time since TEG 12, Trophy and Jacket crowned different winners. Two competitions, two rulers, seventy-two holes of unbroken dominance. Mathematics never lies.
