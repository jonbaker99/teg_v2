**TEG 8 (2015): Lisbon Coast, Portugal**

Gregg Williams claimed his third Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance across four courses on Portugal's Lisbon Coast. Williams never trailed in 72 holes, extending his lead from 4 points after Round 1 to a final 12-point margin over Alex Baker. David Mullin captured his sixth Green Jacket—a tournament record—finishing 6 strokes clear of Jon Baker despite placing fourth in Stableford.

The Jacket lead changed hands dramatically in the final round. Jon Baker held it through 54 holes but lost it at Oitavos Dunes' second hole to Mullin, who sealed victory with closing birdies on the 13th and 16th. Williams's dominance masked chaos: 12 blow-ups including back-to-back calamities on Round 3's 10th and 11th holes. Stuart Neumann earned his first Wooden Spoon, finishing 49 points back despite a birdie start to Round 4—23 blow-ups proved insurmountable.

Henry Meller's final round epitomized the courses' brutality: four blow-ups in five holes (H2-H5) yielded just 2 points and ended his top-three hopes.
