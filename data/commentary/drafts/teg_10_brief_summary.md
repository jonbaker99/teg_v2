# TEG 10: Algarve, Portugal (2017)

Alex Baker claimed his first Trophy with an 11-point victory, overcoming an 8-point first-round deficit to seize control in Round 3. David Mullin collected his eighth Green Jacket in dominant fashion, leading wire-to-wire and finishing 12 strokes clear. Baker's breakthrough came after three consecutive runner-up finishes, his final-round 51 points—a new all-time TEG record—pulling him clear of Gregg Williams.

John Patterson's tournament ended in catastrophe: quintuple bogeys in Round 3, then a sextuple on the 8th hole in Round 4, part of a 21-point collapse that sealed his first Wooden Spoon. Williams, chasing a fourth Trophy, led entering the final round but blow-ups on the 1st, 6th and 18th holes dropped him to second. Jon Baker finished runner-up in the Jacket, 12 strokes behind Mullin's relentless pace.

The Algarve hosted TEG for the first time since 2012, with Boavista appearing twice and two new Palmares combinations testing the field across 72 holes.
