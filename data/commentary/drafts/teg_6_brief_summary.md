**TEG 6, Catalonia, Spain (2013)**

Gregg Williams claimed his second Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory, leading all 72 holes but surviving a catastrophic final round to prevail by just 3 points over Jon Baker. David Mullin captured his fourth Green Jacket—a TEG record—winning by 4 strokes despite finishing fourth in the Stableford. Baker came agonizingly close to the sweep, finishing runner-up in both competitions.

Williams's dominance masked extreme volatility: a tournament-best 48-point opening round collapsed to a horror-show 28 points in the finale, featuring eight blow-ups on the Stadium Course. The final round delivered chaos—Williams lost the Trophy lead on H7, regained it on H10, and hung on as Baker melted down with a sextuple-bogey on H9 that cost him the Jacket lead. Mullin reclaimed the gross title with a steady closing +22, while Baker's +27 left him 4 strokes short in both competitions.

The tournament set a grim record: 53 triple-bogeys or worse across the field, with Williams suffering 21 alone. Henry Meller earned his third Wooden Spoon despite posting the week's best single round—41 points in Round 2 at Costa Brava.
