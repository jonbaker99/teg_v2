# TEG 14: David Mullin Survives Alex Baker's 43-Point Surge by Two Points {.report-title}

<p class="dateline">TEG 14 | Kent | 2021</p>

---

## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

David Mullin led for seventy-two consecutive holes and still nearly lost. This is amateur golf distilled to its essence: a man spending four days constructing an elaborate defensive structure only to watch it catch fire in the final hour while he fumbles for a bucket. His third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket arrived via the tournament's narrowest margin, a two-point survival act over Alex Baker whose volcanic final round of forty-three points might be the most spectacular failure in TEG history. Jon Baker simultaneously finished second in gross and dead last in Stableford, a feat requiring such precise incompetence it borders on performance art.

Kent bore witness to this three-day collapse filmed at half speed. Four rounds across Royal Cinque Ports, Littlestone, and Prince's tested championship resolve. All four players recorded catastrophic blow-ups exceeding ten shots. Every participant hit double-digit carnage at some point. Mullin's wire-to-wire dominance became a masterclass in nervous preservation. Victory margins shrank like ice cream in sunshine.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**David MULLIN (Trophy Winner, Green Jacket Winner):** Led from the first hole, which sounds triumphant until you realise it meant seventy-two holes of watching your lead evaporate like confidence. His 154 points and plus-sixty-eight gross represented steadiness in a field defined by volcanic instability. Four birdies, six zero-point holes, and the standard deviations of a man clinging to sanity by his fingernails. When his closest rival mounted a final-round charge capable of overtaking him, Mullin responded with thirty-seven points, which is the golfing equivalent of defending your home with a rolled-up newspaper.

**Alex BAKER (Trophy Runner-up):** Closed a nine-point gap to two with the tournament's best round, forty-three points of pure rage against mathematics. Finished second by margins requiring microscopes. Zero birdies across four rounds, which makes his near-victory even more absurd. Nine zero-point holes including a catastrophic ten on the sixteenth in Round Four, moments after threatening genuine contention. His scorecard reads like someone fighting their way out of quicksand by climbing on their own shoulders.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (Trophy 3rd, Green Jacket 3rd):** Posted the tournament's best Stableford round, thirty-nine points in Round Three, which moved him precisely nowhere. Finished seventeen points behind in Trophy, eight behind in Jacket. Zero birdies. Seven zero-point holes. His front-nine-to-back-nine differentials suggest a man who takes six holes to remember how golf works.

**Jon BAKER (Trophy Spoon, Green Jacket Runner-up):** Five birdies, most in the field. Runner-up in gross by seven shots. Wooden Spoon in Stableford with 125 points. This man exists in quantum superposition, simultaneously excellent and catastrophic. Eleven zero-point holes. Eight on three separate occasions. His scorecards need trigger warnings.

## Round 1: Hope Meeting Royal Cinque Ports {.round1 .round}

Royal Cinque Ports hosted the opening act, a championship links with a reputation for consuming hubris. The wind came off the Channel like an audit. Four men teed off believing in their preparations. By the third hole, three of them knew better.

Mullin and Alex Baker shared the early lead through one hole, a moment of optimism that lasted approximately eight minutes. The third hole, a par five, became a theatre of operations. Gregg Williams posted nine. Jon Baker managed eight. These numbers require context: par was five. Both men recorded zeros in Stableford, which is golf's way of saying "we'll pretend that didn't happen except we're writing it down."

Jon Baker doubled down on the fifth with another eight. Two holes, two catastrophes, a front nine that read like accident reports. Ten points across six holes. Meanwhile, Mullin suffered his own seven on the seventh, losing the Jacket lead. He responded like a man who'd actually read the assignment, birdieing the tenth to reclaim first place. Alex Baker, in contrast, posted ten on the sixteenth, a score requiring sustained commitment to disaster. Then a seven on the eighteenth, because why not.

Mullin closed with forty points and a five-shot gross lead. Alex Baker held second on thirty-seven points despite three blow-ups. Jon Baker's twenty-nine points earned last place. The margins established themselves early. Gregg Williams occupied third, plotting his eventual escape from irrelevance.

## Round 2: Littlestone and the Art of Extending Leads {.round2 .round}

Littlestone-on-Sea sits on the Romney Marshes like a challenge written in grass. Purves designed it, Braid and MacKenzie refined it. Championship pedigree. The field approached it like men approaching a particularly aggressive dentist.

Mullin posted forty-one points, including birdies on the seventh and eighteenth. Eight pars or better. One zero-point hole, the fourth, where his seven felt almost apologetic. He extended his Trophy lead to nine points, his Jacket advantage to three shots. These numbers matter because they represent breathing room. Or what passes for breathing room in amateur golf.

Alex Baker recorded five blow-ups. Five. Two zero-point holes. His thirty-five points kept him second but the gap yawned. Jon Baker managed twenty-nine points again, which demonstrates impressive consistency in mediocrity. Gregg Williams posted twenty-seven with four zero-point holes, a round requiring sustained commitment to damage limitation.

The standings crystallised. Mullin led both competitions. Alex Baker sat second in Trophy, fourth in Jacket. The stage was set. Nobody bothered checking if the stage was structurally sound.

## Round 3: Prince's and the Beginning of Unraveling {.round3 .round}

Prince's Shore-Dunes combination represents the club's strongest routing. The field approached it like men who'd forgotten their previous two rounds. Mullin immediately posted eight on the second, zero points, his lead suddenly flammable. Then a seven on the seventh. Then nine on the eighth, zero points, the mathematical equivalent of self-harm.

Jon Baker birdied the second, moments after Mullin's collapse. Then posted seven on the fourth, seven on the sixth, five on the eleventh, eight on the thirteenth, six on the seventeenth. His round contained a birdie and five blow-ups, which is like building a house and setting five rooms on fire. Twenty-eight points. But his gross score held steady, maintaining Jacket contention through pure spite.

Gregg Williams posted the day's best Stableford round, thirty-nine points. His gross of plus-fourteen closed the Jacket gap from eighteen shots to twelve. In normal circumstances, this represents a charge. In TEG terms, it's a gentle jog towards relevance.

Mullin's thirty-six points kept him eight clear in Trophy despite his struggles. Alex Baker's thirty-seven points moved him into second place. The final round awaited. Leads could be defended or surrendered. Probably both simultaneously.

## Round 4: The Two-Point Survival {.round4 .round}

Prince's again. Familiarity breeds not contempt but catastrophe. Alex Baker opened with four points on the first. Four on the seventh. Four on the thirteenth. Four on the fourteenth. Between these moments of brilliance, he posted seven on the tenth, eight on the twelfth. Then the sixteenth arrived.

Ten shots. Plus-six. Zero points. The most spectacular self-administered wound in tournament history, coming precisely when victory seemed mathematically viable. His forty-three points still represented the tournament's best round. He closed the gap from nine to two. It wasn't enough.

Jon Baker posted four birdies, the second, sixth, twelfth, and thirteenth. His gross of plus-eleven secured Jacket runner-up by seven shots. His Stableford total of 125 points earned the Wooden Spoon. He also posted eight on the eighteenth, because consistency matters. This man contains multitudes, all of them contradictory.

Mullin needed only thirty-seven points. He delivered precisely that, including an eight on the tenth that briefly made coronary arrests a possibility. His lead shrank to two points. Wire-to-wire victory, maintained by the width of a putting stroke.

Gregg Williams finished seventeen points back in Trophy, eight behind in Jacket. He posted thirty-eight points, which in any other tournament might matter.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

David Mullin defended his leads across seventy-two holes and arrived at victory gasping like a man who'd run a marathon in dress shoes. His third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket represent cumulative excellence rather than dominant performance. He led wire-to-wire, which sounds impressive until you realise he nearly surrendered everything in the final nine holes. Two-point margins don't inspire confidence. They inspire therapy.

Alex Baker's forty-three-point final round represented the tournament's single best performance and its most spectacular failure. His catastrophic ten on the sixteenth, coming moments after genuine contention, might be the most perfectly timed disaster in TEG history. Zero birdies across four rounds. Nine zero-point holes. Still nearly won. This is golf as Greek tragedy, assuming the Greeks played off twenty-four handicaps.

Jon Baker finished second in gross, last in Stableford. Five birdies, most in the field. Wooden Spoon recipient. He exists in permanent contradiction, simultaneously brilliant and catastrophic. His scorecards require philosophical analysis.

TEG 14 belonged to no one and everyone. All four players posted double-digit blow-ups. Every participant suffered complete unravelings. The margins between victory and defeat shrank to two points in Trophy, seven shots in Jacket. Kent's championship links witnessed golf at its most beautifully futile. Mullin survived. Baker charged. Williams closed. Jon Baker birdied his way to last place. Nobody claimed dominance. Several claimed survival.

## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}

- **Jon BAKER:** Course Record (Prince's - Shore/Dunes): 83 gross, Round 4, TEG 14

No new TEG records were set during this tournament.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

**Catastrophic Blow-ups (10+ shots)**
All four players recorded double-digit disasters, confirming TEG 14's status as a masterclass in voluntary suffering:
- Alex BAKER: 10 on H16 R4 (catastrophic +6)
- Gregg WILLIAMS: 9 on H3 R1 (blow-up +4)
- Jon BAKER: 8 on three separate occasions (H3 R1, H5 R1, H18 R4)
- David MULLIN: 9 on H8 R3 (blow-up +4)

**Zero-Point Hole Accumulation**
- Jon BAKER: 11 zero-point holes (led field in mathematical erasure)
- Alex BAKER: 9 zero-point holes
- Gregg WILLIAMS: 7 zero-point holes
- David MULLIN: 6 zero-point holes (fewest, yet still six acts of scorecard violence)

**The Birdie Paradox**
- Jon BAKER: 5 birdies, Wooden Spoon (125 pts)
- David MULLIN: 4 birdies, Trophy and Jacket winner (154 pts)
- Alex BAKER: 0 birdies, Trophy runner-up (152 pts)
- Gregg WILLIAMS: 0 birdies, Trophy 3rd (137 pts)

This statistical reality confirms that excellence and disaster coexist in perfect harmony, that birdies guarantee nothing, and that consistency in mediocrity defeats brilliance punctuated by catastrophe. Jon Baker's five birdies earned him last place. David Mullin's four won both titles. Golf remains fundamentally absurd.

**Trophy Margin Analysis**
The two-point final margin represents the tightest finish in TEG 14 history despite zero lead changes after Round One. Mullin led for seventy-two consecutive holes yet arrived at victory like a man fleeing a burning building. Alex Baker closed from nine points back with a forty-three-point eruption and still finished second. Twenty-nine points separated second from fourth place (Baker 152, Williams 137, Jon Baker 125), confirming that the field existed in three distinct categories: survived, nearly survived, and Jon.
