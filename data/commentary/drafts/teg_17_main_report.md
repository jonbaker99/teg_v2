## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker claimed his fourth TEG Trophy and fourth Green Jacket with a performance that redefined control. The Lisbon Coast return saw familiar venues but unprecedented command, as Baker seized both leads in Round Two and never looked back across 54 holes. His 18-point Stableford margin and 13-stroke gross victory represented the largest winning gaps in recent TEG memory. David Mullin's tournament showcased remarkable contrasts: a best-round 47 points in Round Two, rendered futile by an opening catastrophe that saw him register nought on the first two holes. John Patterson's campaign told an equally dramatic story, from Round One leader to the worst single-round collapse in recorded TEG history, before clawing back to joint second place.

West Cliffs provided the backdrop for Round Two's decisive shift. Baker never trailed again, leading 67 of 72 holes in the Stableford competition and an extraordinary 70 of 72 in the gross battle. The margins only widened as the tournament progressed through Royal Óbidos and back to Praia D'El Rey, where Baker's coronation became a procession rather than a contest.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Praia D'El Rey {.round1 .round}

Praia D'El Rey's links and parkland mix set the stage for early fireworks. Patterson held a slender one-point Stableford advantage, while Baker and Gregg Williams shared the gross lead at +20. The opening holes separated contenders from casualties immediately.

Mullin's tournament unravelled before it began. Seven at the first, a triple bogey that yielded nothing. Eight at the second, another par five blown apart. By the time he reached the third tee, Mullin had played 15 strokes for nought and sat fifth in the standings. Alex Baker's start proved equally calamitous, a six at the third marking the beginning of a stretch that would define his week. Holes three through five brought disaster, blow-up, and catastrophe in sequence: a triple at the par three, an eight at the fourth, then ten strokes at the fifth for no return. The damage measured 24 over par across three holes.

Patterson, meanwhile, constructed his lead through steadier golf and a purple patch from holes 11 through 16. Birdies bookended a run that delivered 18 points, culminating in a four-pointer at the 16th that moved him clear. Baker remained in touch despite his own implosion at the 17th, an eight at the par five costing valuable ground. By day's end, Patterson led by the narrowest of margins. Williams claimed a share of the gross lead. The tournament remained wide open.

## Round 2: Collapse and Brilliance at West Cliffs {.round2 .round}

West Cliffs delivered the tournament's pivotal moments within its opening holes. Baker struck immediately, taking the Trophy lead at the first when Patterson found seven and surrendered zero points. Williams lost the Jacket lead on the same hole. The die was cast.

What followed will live long in TEG lore. Patterson's implosion across the middle holes reached historic proportions. Ten at the 13th, a quintuple bogey. Then 11 at the 15th, a sextuple blow-up. Between holes eight and 15, he averaged close to four over per hole, registering just two points from eight holes. His round total of 22 points marked the worst single performance in recorded TEG history, a collapse that saw him plummet from first to fifth in a single day.

Mullin responded to his opening disaster with the tournament's finest round. Back-to-back birdies at the ninth and tenth sparked a run that would reach 47 points, the best 18-hole performance of the week. His birdie at the 15th, the same hole where Patterson found ruin, exemplified the day's contrasts. By the 18th, Mullin had claimed the Jacket lead on gross, though Baker's Stableford position remained secure.

Baker himself crafted a birdie at the fourth and navigated the chaos with 44 points. His two-point Trophy advantage felt more commanding than the number suggested. Alex Baker found a birdie at the 12th amid his own struggles, while Williams posted 35 points to stay within range. The battle lines had been redrawn entirely.

## Round 3: Baker Breaks Clear at Royal Óbidos {.round3 .round}

Seve Ballesteros' final design provided the setting for Baker's statement round. An 11-point Trophy advantage by day's end and an eight-stroke Jacket margin told the story of one man pulling away from the field. The contest for supremacy was effectively over.

Baker stumbled early, a triple at the first costing him the Jacket lead briefly. He regained it at the second. Lost it again at the sixth. Reclaimed it at the seventh. These skirmishes proved mere footnotes to his growing dominance. Birdies at the 11th and 13th anchored a back nine stretch that delivered 26 points, his 44-point round matching Round Two's output and extending both leads decisively.

Patterson mounted a recovery of sorts, his 41 points lifting him back to fourth in the Trophy standings. A birdie at the eighth showed quality remained, though a blow-up at the ninth and a nightmare nine at the 11th demonstrated fragility persisted. Williams claimed a birdie at the 11th but suffered through the closing holes, his 26-point round dropping him to Spoon position when Alex Baker's ten at the 14th sent him tumbling back.

Mullin's 35 points kept him second but now trailed by double figures. Alex Baker's round featured extremes in miniature: a five-point birdie at the third, immediately followed by a card-wrecker at the fourth. His tournament of contradictions continued unabated. Baker led both competitions by margins that spoke to superiority rather than fortune.

## Round 4: Coronation at Praia D'El Rey {.round4 .round}

The closing round became a coronation rather than a contest. Baker's 40 points and controlled gross play brought him home with 166 points total, 18 clear of Mullin's 148. The 13-stroke Jacket advantage underlined complete dominance across both formats. Williams, Mullin, and Patterson all found disasters at the opening hole, handing Baker an unassailable position from the outset.

Baker's birdies at the fourth and fifth provided early punctuation, though blow-ups at the seventh, tenth, and 17th showed even champions endure rough patches. The difference lay in cushion and consistency. His six zero-point holes across 72 holes told a story of steady accumulation that others could not match.

Mullin secured sole second place with 33 points, his tournament average betrayed by the opening day catastrophe. Patterson's 33 points lifted him to joint second in the Trophy standings, a remarkable recovery from his Round Two nadir. His birdie at the second and four-pointer at the 16th bookended a round marred by a nine at the 14th and a ten at the 15th, close to five over per hole across that stretch. The volatility that defined his week never fully disappeared.

Alex Baker's closing 32 points, featuring blow-ups at the seventh, eighth, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 15th, exemplified his tournament of extremes. Williams posted 29 points but could not escape the Spoon position, dropping from joint gross leader after Round One to wooden holder by tournament's end. Baker stood alone at the summit, his fourth Trophy and fourth Jacket secured with rounds to spare.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's fourth Trophy triumph represented dominance of a rare order. Leading 93 per cent of holes after seizing control in Round Two, he constructed victories through accumulation rather than pyrotechnics. Five birdies across 72 holes might seem modest, but his consistency told the real story: just six zero-point holes all week, an average that left rivals scrambling to keep pace. The 18-point Stableford margin and 13-stroke gross advantage marked the largest winning gaps in recent memory, testament to sustained excellence across four demanding layouts.

David Mullin's tournament split neatly into catastrophe and brilliance. His 47-point second round, featuring back-to-back birdies and four in total, stood as the week's finest performance. Yet the opening day blow-up, nought on the first two holes, proved too large a deficit to overcome. He finished second in both competitions, a runner-up whose best golf arrived too late to challenge for supremacy.

John Patterson's week encapsulated volatility. From Round One leader to historic 22-point collapse, then recovery to joint third by the close, his 19-point range between best and worst rounds illustrated wild fluctuations. Eighteen zero-point holes betrayed fragility, yet his ability to rebound demonstrated character. Alex Baker's tied third-place finish, achieved despite 12 blanks across the tournament, spoke to resilience amid chaos. Just two birdies all week highlighted scoring struggles, yet he hung on where others faltered.

Gregg Williams' fall from joint gross leader after Round One to Spoon holder by tournament's end completed the narrative arcs. Baker stood alone, his command absolute from West Cliffs onward, a champion who seized control and never relinquished it.
