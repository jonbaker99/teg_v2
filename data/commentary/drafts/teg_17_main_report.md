## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker secured his fourth TEG Trophy and fourth Green Jacket with a comprehensive sweep across four days of Portuguese golf. The margin tells the story: eighteen points in Stableford, thirteen strokes in Gross. Baker led for 67 of 72 Trophy holes and 70 of 72 Jacket holes after seizing control in Round Two. Zero lead changes followed over the final 54 holes. This was command, not contest.

David Mullin finished runner-up in both competitions despite producing the tournament's finest round, a 47-point masterclass at West Cliffs that came too late to matter. The opening morning at Praia D'El Rey saw coastal winds gusting across the links nine, testing every player's resolve. John Patterson's defence of his overnight Trophy lead collapsed spectacularly in Round Two with a 22-point implosion featuring eight zero-pointers. Gregg Williams, who co-led the Jacket after Round One, finished last in the Trophy by 43 points to claim the Spoon.

## Round 1: Opening Salvoes at Praia D'El Rey {.round1 .round}

John Patterson held a fragile one-point Trophy lead after 18 holes at Praia D'El Rey. Gregg Williams and Jon Baker shared the Jacket lead on plus-20. The Atlantic winds made scoring treacherous across the clifftop back nine, where calamity lurked at every turn.

Baker took the Trophy lead at the third hole but surrendered it to Patterson at the 16th, where the latter collected his third four-pointer in six holes. Patterson's hot streak from the eighth through the 17th yielded 18 points in a purple patch built around a birdie at the par-five 12th. David Mullin endured a wretched start with back-to-back horror holes at the first and second, both yielding zero points as he scrambled to seven and eight respectively. He recovered steadily through the middle section, stringing together level par golf from the 11th and finding a birdie at the 13th.

Alex Baker's round became a war of attrition. Three consecutive blow-ups from the third through the fifth cost him 13 strokes and zero points, leaving him nine, eight and ten over par. He rallied with four-pointers at the 11th and 16th but limped home with a nine at the last. Williams registered eight blow-ups but somehow shared the Jacket lead. Patterson's late surge gave him 39 points. Baker sat second on 38. The Trophy battle looked poised.

## Round 2: Patterson's Catastrophic Collapse at West Cliffs {.round2 .round}

West Cliffs, Cynthia Dye's award-winning links, greeted the field with dramatic ocean views and unforgiving dune terrain. Baker seized both leads by the first hole. Patterson relinquished his overnight advantage with a triple-bogey seven and never recovered. What followed was carnage.

Patterson's round became a catalogue of devastation: eight zero-point holes, nine triple-bogeys or worse. The 13th yielded a ten. The 15th, an eleven. Between the sixth and 17th, he registered just six points across 12 holes, averaging close to four over per hole. His 22-point total represented the worst round in his TEG career and the joint-worst in all-time history. Finished with plus-44 gross. Baker, by contrast, opened with birdies at the fourth and three consecutive four-pointers to establish breathing space. He led the Trophy by two points at day's end.

Mullin produced the tournament's masterclass: 47 points and plus-10 gross. He birdied the ninth and tenth consecutively, added another at the 15th, and seized the Jacket lead with a solid finish at the 18th. Alex Baker registered 37 points despite blow-ups at the tenth and 11th, both yielding zeros. Williams mustered 35 points but slipped from the Jacket summit. Patterson's implosion meant Baker held both competitions. The runaway had begun.

## Round 3: Baker's Breakaway at Royal Óbidos {.round3 .round}

Seve Ballesteros' final design provided the stage for Baker's assertion of dominance. He briefly lost the Jacket lead at the first with a triple-bogey seven but reclaimed it by the second and never looked back. Royal Óbidos rewarded precision and punished profligacy. Baker delivered both the former and avoided the latter.

Baker's back nine became a procession: birdies at the 11th and 13th anchored a stretch yielding 20 points across six holes. His 44-point round extended his Trophy lead to eleven points and his Jacket margin to eight strokes. Patterson rebounded with 41 points, climbing from fifth to fourth in the Trophy standings after his Round Two nightmare. His birdie at the eighth offered brief hope before a triple at the ninth and a quadruple at the 11th reminded everyone of his volatility. Mullin's 35 points kept him second in both competitions but the gap had widened.

Alex Baker endured a catastrophic ten at the 14th, surrendering six over par and zero points in a single blow-up that epitomised his round. He finished with 34 points and plus-38. Williams collected 26 points, fell to last in the Trophy, and found himself staring at the Spoon. Patterson briefly occupied the Spoon position after the 14th but his late surge lifted him clear. Baker's 86 gross set a new Royal Óbidos course record. The tournament was decided.

## Round 4: Baker's Coronation at Praia D'El Rey {.round4 .round}

The final round returned to Praia D'El Rey, where the story had begun four days earlier. Baker required only steady progress to secure both trophies. He delivered precisely that. Opening birdie pairs at the fourth and fifth provided the early flourish, though blow-ups at the seventh, tenth and 17th reminded everyone that par golf on this exposed links remains a battle.

Mullin opened with a triple-bogey seven at the first, undermining his challenge before it started. He finished with 33 points and plus-24, identical in Stableford to Patterson but nine strokes superior in Gross. Patterson matched Mullin's 33 points but his back nine collapsed with a sextuple-bogey nine at the 14th and a ten at the 15th. He salvaged four points at the 16th with a level-par four but blow-ups at the 17th and 18th capped another turbulent day. Front nine: 21 points. Back nine: twelve. The pattern held.

Alex Baker's round became a grind through the back nine, where he registered just 13 points compared to 19 on the front. Blow-ups at the 12th and 13th yielded consecutive zeros. Williams opened with a quintuple-bogey nine at the first and never recovered, finishing with 29 points. Baker's 40-point final round secured victory by 18 points in the Trophy and 13 strokes in the Jacket. Mullin claimed runner-up in both competitions. Baker had led unchallenged for 54 consecutive holes.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's fourth Trophy and fourth Jacket arrived with an authority seldom seen in TEG competition. He led 67 of 72 Trophy holes and 70 of 72 Jacket holes, establishing control in Round Two and never relinquishing it. Zero lead changes followed across the final three days. The 18-point Trophy margin and 13-stroke Jacket cushion told a story of sustained excellence across four demanding Portuguese courses.

David Mullin's runner-up finish in both competitions carried the frustration of what might have been. His 47-point Round Two at West Cliffs represented the tournament's finest individual performance but came after an opening-day deficit he could never bridge. John Patterson's tournament arc traced disaster and recovery. His Round One lead vanished in a catastrophic 22-point Round Two collapse at West Cliffs, the worst round in his career. Eight zero-point holes and nine triple-bogeys or worse summed up the carnage. He rallied with 41 points in Round Three but never threatened again.

Gregg Williams claimed the Spoon despite co-leading the Jacket after Round One. His 123-point total left him 43 behind Baker in the Trophy, illustrating the gulf that emerged over four days. Alex Baker's four rounds between 32 and 37 points yielded joint-third in the Trophy but left him 31 points adrift, consistency without the peaks required to challenge. Baker's sweep represented only the second time a player has won both Trophy and Jacket at the same TEG. Command, not contest. Coronation, not combat. The Lisbon coast witnessed a rout.

**David MULLIN (2nd):** Runner-up in both competitions despite tournament-best 47-point Round Two at West Cliffs. Opening-day deficit proved insurmountable. Solid consistency across all four rounds but lacked the early pace.

**Alex BAKER (T3rd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Four rounds between 32 and 37 points illustrated remarkable steadiness without dramatic peaks. Multiple blow-ups each day prevented higher finish. Consistency without conquest.
