## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker swept both competitions with ruthless efficiency, claiming his fifth TEG Trophy and fourth Green Jacket across four Lisbon Coast courses. The 18-point Trophy margin and 13-stroke Jacket advantage represented the most comprehensive victory in tournament history. Baker led 67 of 72 holes in the Stableford and 70 of 72 in the Gross, establishing control at West Cliffs on Round 2 and never relinquishing either title.

The tournament hinged on contrasting fortunes. John Patterson opened with 39 points to lead by one, then suffered the worst single-round collapse ever recorded when 22 points in Round 2 dropped him from first to fifth. David Mullin's tournament-best 47-point response at West Cliffs featured back-to-back birdies but couldn't overcome opening struggles. Gregg Williams led the Jacket after Praia D'El Rey's opener yet faded to the Wooden Spoon despite finishing third in stroke play.

Baker's triumph was built on remarkable steadiness rather than fireworks. Five birdies across 72 holes told only part of the story. His consistency proved decisive.

## Round 1: Patterson Edges Opener at Praia D'El Rey {.round1 .round}

John Patterson held a precarious one-point Trophy lead over Jon Baker after 18 holes at Praia D'El Rey, with Gregg Williams sharing the Jacket lead at plus-20. The coastal parkland course played tough. Nobody broke par.

Patterson's opening round featured four-point holes at the 9th, 12th, 15th and 16th, including a birdie at the par-five 12th. He seized the Trophy lead at the 16th. Baker led for 15 holes before a double bogey at the same hole cost him the advantage. Alex Baker's round disintegrated spectacularly between the 3rd and 5th, recording three consecutive zeroes including a sextuple bogey at the par-four 5th. He carded nine at the 18th to drop into last place in the Trophy standings.

David Mullin opened with blow-ups at the 1st and 2nd to fall to the bottom but recovered brilliantly. A birdie at the 13th sparked a six-hole stretch at level par. Williams and Baker shared the Jacket lead at plus-20, three strokes clear.

## Round 2: Mullin's Masterclass as Patterson Implodes {.round2 .round}

Jon Baker seized both leads at West Cliffs' opening hole when Patterson's triple bogey handed him control. What followed redrew the entire tournament. David Mullin posted 47 points, the best round in TEG history, while Patterson suffered the worst recorded collapse.

Mullin's brilliance peaked with back-to-back birdies at the 9th and 10th, part of a six-hole run yielding 18 points. Another birdie followed at the 15th. The round of 47 points and plus-10 gross lifted him from third to the Jacket lead, which he surrendered only on the final hole to Baker. Jon Baker's birdie at the par-four 4th anchored an opening stretch worth 18 points across six holes. He extended his Trophy advantage to two points.

Patterson's nightmare unfolded after the opening triple bogey. Further blow-ups at the 3rd and 6th preceded the real horror. A 10 at the par-five 13th was followed by an 11 at the 15th. Eight zero-point holes across the round produced just 22 points and plus-44 gross. The implosion dropped him from first to fifth.

Alex Baker managed 37 points despite blow-ups at the 10th and 11th, his birdie at the par-three 12th offering some compensation. Williams posted 35 points to sit fourth.

## Round 3: Baker Breaks Clear at Royal Óbidos {.round3 .round}

Jon Baker extended his Trophy lead from two points to 11 at Royal Óbidos, Seve Ballesteros' final design. His 44-point round featured birdies at the par-five 11th and par-three 13th. The Jacket lead changed hands four times across the opening eight holes before Baker established permanent control.

The round began poorly for Baker. A triple bogey at the 1st cost him the Jacket lead. He regained it at the 2nd, lost it again at the 6th, then reclaimed it for good at the 7th. An 11-point surge from the 11th through 13th, powered by those two birdies, secured both competitions. David Mullin challenged briefly but finished with 35 points to slip to second, now trailing by 11.

Alex Baker's birdie at the par-three 3rd proved his highlight before a quintuple bogey at the 14th destroyed momentum. His 10 at that hole was followed by a nine at the 18th, finishing with 34 points. Patterson recovered composure with 41 points, including a birdie at the par-three 8th, but blow-ups at the 9th and 11th prevented any real challenge.

Gregg Williams posted the round's lowest score with 26 points and dropped to fifth in the Trophy. His Wooden Spoon position solidified.

## Round 4: Baker Cruises Home at Praia D'El Rey {.round4 .round}

Jon Baker returned to Praia D'El Rey with both titles secured, posting 40 points to complete the sweep. Back-to-back birdies at the 4th and 5th underlined his control. The final margins told the story: 18 points in the Trophy, 13 strokes in the Jacket.

David Mullin's 33-point final round secured second place in both competitions, 18 points and 13 strokes behind. His consistency across the final three rounds couldn't overcome the opening setback. Patterson and Alex Baker both managed 32 points, but Patterson's superior Gross score lifted him to joint-third in the Trophy.

Patterson endured more misery. A birdie at the par-five 2nd offered hope before blow-ups at the par-three 14th and par-four 15th brought nines and a 10. Williams opened with a nine at the 1st and never recovered. Twenty-nine points confirmed the Wooden Spoon. He finished third in the Jacket but fifth in the Trophy.

Baker's fifth Trophy title equalled his Jacket count at four. Wire-to-wire dominance across 72 holes made this his most authoritative triumph.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire dominance redefined TEG excellence. Leading 67 of 72 Stableford holes and 70 of 72 Gross holes represented the most comprehensive control in tournament history. His fifth Trophy and fourth Jacket arrived through relentless consistency rather than spectacular golf. Five birdies across four rounds told a modest story, but steadiness proved decisive. The 18-point Trophy margin and 13-stroke Jacket advantage dwarfed previous winning margins.

The tournament's drama centred on John Patterson's spectacular collapse. Leading after Praia D'El Rey's opener with 39 points, his Round 2 implosion produced just 22 points with eight zero-point holes. The 10 at West Cliffs' 13th and 11 at the 15th ranked among the worst holes in TEG history. He recovered partial dignity with 41 points in Round 3 and 33 in Round 4 but finished joint-third, 31 points behind.

David Mullin's tournament-best 47-point Round 2, featuring back-to-back birdies at the 9th and 10th, couldn't overcome his opening struggles. Second place in both competitions represented a strong finish. Alex Baker's tournament featured extreme volatility, including a sextuple bogey in Round 1 and quintuple bogey in Round 3.

Gregg Williams claimed the Wooden Spoon despite leading the Jacket after Round 1. His third-place Gross finish couldn't prevent fifth in the Trophy.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

**Jon BAKER (1st):** Five birdies across 72 holes understated the achievement. Led 67 Stableford holes and 70 Gross holes, establishing control at West Cliffs and never faltering. Fifth Trophy title, fourth Jacket. Most dominant TEG victory on record.

**David MULLIN (2nd):** Tournament-best 47 points in Round 2 featured back-to-back birdies and extraordinary consistency. Four birdies total. Second place in both competitions, finishing 18 points and 13 strokes behind after opening-round struggles cost him any realistic title challenge.

**John PATTERSON (T3):** Led after Round 1 with 39 points before catastrophic Round 2 collapse. Twenty-two points with eight zero-point holes, including a 10 at the 13th and 11 at the 15th, dropped him from first to fifth. Recovered with 41 and 33 points in final rounds but joint-third finish represented disappointment.

**Alex BAKER (T3):** Twelve zero-point holes defined a volatile tournament. Sextuple bogey at Round 1's 5th, quintuple bogey at Round 3's 14th. Birdie at Round 3's par-three 3rd offered brief promise. Joint-third in Trophy, fifth in Jacket.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (5th):** Wooden Spoon winner despite leading Jacket after Round 1. Eight zero-point holes. Third place in Jacket couldn't prevent fifth in Trophy. Blow-ups at Round 3's 5th and Round 4's opener undermined any challenge.
