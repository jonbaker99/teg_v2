## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

John Patterson claimed the TEG Trophy in his maiden appearance, seizing control with a record 49-point performance in Round 2 and holding firm through volatile final rounds to win by six points. David Mullin added an seventh Green Jacket to his collection with a wire-to-wire display of gross scoring consistency, leading all 72 holes from the 15th of the opening round and prevailing by 21 strokes. Royal Óbidos provided the rugged backdrop, Seve Ballesteros' final design demanding respect across two visits.

The tale of two competitions could hardly have been starker. Patterson's Stableford mastery built an unshakeable foundation early, whilst Mullin's relentless accuracy in gross terms never wavered. Alex Baker staged a dramatic resurrection after a disastrous opening 32 points, posting back-to-back 44-point rounds to snatch second place. Thirty-eight blow-ups across four days told the story of brutal scoring conditions; only ten birdies surfaced tournament-wide. Patterson alone managed four.

## Round 1: Opening Salvo at Royal Óbidos {.round1 .round}

Royal Óbidos greeted the field with its trademark water hazards glinting under Portuguese sun. Jon Baker led the Trophy chase by a single point. David Mullin held a two-stroke advantage in the Jacket race. The margins suggested volatility ahead.

Patterson seized the Trophy lead at the opening hole with a three-pointer, though Jon Baker reclaimed it by the sixth. Disaster struck multiple players early. Gregg Williams carded a quintuple at the first. Alex Baker suffered a quadruple at the second, then an 11 at the 14th. Stuart Neumann posted four blow-ups before the turn, accumulating just six points across holes seven through 12. Patterson himself endured a sextuple at the fourth, surrendering the lead briefly, before rallying with a birdie at the 17th. Mullin quietly assembled level par golf from the 13th through the 15th, moving into the Jacket lead at the par-three 15th. He never relinquished it.

Jon Baker closed with 39 points despite a quadruple at the last. Patterson sat one behind on 38. Mullin matched that Stableford total whilst leading on gross at 15 over. Alex Baker limped in with 32 points and 43 over par, his worst gross score in nine TEG appearances. Williams and Neumann trailed the leaders by eight and 16 points respectively. The tournament's brutal nature had declared itself.

## Round 2: Patterson's Explosion at Praia D'El Rey {.round2 .round}

Praia D'El Rey unfurled its spectacular dunes and coastal drama. Patterson trailed by a point. The Trophy remained anybody's prize. Within an hour, the landscape had transformed entirely.

Jon Baker's defence collapsed at the opening hole with a triple bogey. Patterson took the Trophy lead with a three-pointer. He never looked back. A birdie at the seventh launched an extraordinary spell: 11 points across holes ten through 12, capped by another birdie at the par-five 12th. He posted four points at both the 15th and 17th, closing with 49 points, a mark 11 clear of Alex Baker's resurgent 44. The deficit was suddenly ten points. Williams and Neumann both suffered quadruples at the ninth. Baker endured another blow-up at the tenth. Jon Baker managed a birdie at the 17th but trailed by 13 points. Mullin tied Patterson's gross score at 14 over, briefly sharing the Jacket lead before Patterson's Stableford deluge pulled him clear in both competitions.

Patterson stood on 87 points with a cushion that felt unassailable. Baker's twin 44-point rounds had dragged him from 20 points behind to second place, eight adrift. Jon Baker remained in touch on 76 points. Mullin's 14-over round kept him within touching distance in gross terms, tied with Patterson at 43 over. The Jacket battle remained alive.

## Round 3: Volatile Struggle at Royal Óbidos {.round3 .round}

Royal Óbidos reclaimed the stage. Patterson led by ten points. Mullin held a seven-stroke Jacket advantage. Both men faced stern examinations of their composure.

Patterson's first significant wobble arrived at the par-three third with a triple bogey. He scrambled 34 points, his worst Stableford return, whilst carding 29 over par, his ugliest gross mark. Jon Baker posted a birdie at the second and compiled 34 points, matching Patterson's total but closing no ground. Baker also suffered car-crash holes at the seventh and 11th, the latter a quadruple. Mullin birdied the third but endured a catastrophic nine at the tenth, his only serious lapse in gross terms all week. He still tied Baker's 22-over round, maintaining solo Jacket leadership. Alex Baker produced 42 points despite a horror show at the 14th, his fifth at the par four, moving within striking distance. Williams and Neumann both posted 37 points or better, their strongest rounds, though both remained far from contention.

Patterson clung to a three-point Trophy cushion over Alex Baker, his lead cut by more than half. Mullin extended his Jacket margin to seven strokes over Jon Baker. The final round promised fireworks.

## Round 4: Final Act at Praia D'El Rey {.round4 .round}

Praia D'El Rey hosted the denouement. Patterson's three-point Trophy lead appeared precarious. Mullin's Jacket advantage looked secure. Both competitions delivered late drama.

Alex Baker surged early with a five-point birdie at the eighth and four points at the 11th. A five-pointer at the 13th saw him briefly nose ahead at the 14th hole. Patterson had blown up spectacularly at the fifth with a quintuple but recovered immediately with four points at the sixth. His birdie at the 12th steadied the ship. Baker's challenge crumbled with a quadruple at the 15th and a triple at the 16th. Those two holes conceded ten strokes. Jon Baker suffered a quadruple at the 17th, ending his own late charge. Williams endured an 11 at the seventh, a sextuple that encapsulated his struggles. Neumann posted a birdie at the 13th, one of only three in the round, salvaging respectability with 37 points.

Patterson closed with 47 points, extending his Trophy margin to six over Alex Baker's 44. The final tally read 168 to 162. Mullin cruised home with 38 points and 16 over par, sealing an seventh Green Jacket by 21 strokes over Patterson. Jon Baker finished fourth. Williams claimed fifth. Neumann collected his third Wooden Spoon with 127 points and 125 over par, his 14 blow-ups the most of any competitor.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

John Patterson became the first player to claim the TEG Trophy in his debut appearance, a feat built on the tournament's defining moment: his 49-point explosion at Praia D'El Rey in Round 2. That performance seized both leads, constructed a ten-point cushion, and withstood two volatile closing rounds at Royal Óbidos. His final margin of six points over Alex Baker reflected sustained excellence across 72 holes, punctuated by four birdies and 168 total points.

David Mullin's seventh Green Jacket arrived via a masterclass in consistency, leading from the 15th hole of Round 1 and never conceding ground. His 21-stroke victory over Patterson underscored the gulf in gross scoring. Mullin posted just four blow-ups across the week, fewer than any other competitor, and navigated the brutal conditions with poise. His wire-to-wire command extended an already imposing Jacket collection to eight.

Alex Baker's tournament split into two acts: the disastrous 32-point opener at 43 over par, and the redemption arc that followed. Back-to-back 44-point rounds in Rounds 2 and 4, featuring birdies at the eighth and 13th holes on the final day, propelled him to second place. Nine blow-ups told the cost of his volatile week, yet his finishing surge denied Jon Baker and Mullin podium places in the Trophy standings. Jon Baker's opening 39-point lead evaporated in Round 2, though three birdies and a third-place Jacket finish salvaged respectability. Gregg Williams battled to fifth with 143 points despite an 11 at the seventh in Round 4. Stuart Neumann's third Wooden Spoon reflected 14 blow-ups and 127 points, though his birdie at the 13th on the final day hinted at flashes of competence.

Thirty-eight blow-ups against just ten birdies framed the tournament's savage arithmetic. Patterson stood alone with four birdies; only he recorded multiple red numbers. The Lisbon Coast's twin venues demanded accuracy and nerve. Few possessed either consistently. Patterson's debut dominance announced a formidable new presence. Mullin's relentless accumulation of Jackets continued unabated.
