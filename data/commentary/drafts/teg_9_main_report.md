## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

John Patterson claimed the Trophy in his first TEG appearance, surviving the worst collapse by any leader in tournament history to secure a six-point victory. David Mullin extended his Green Jacket record to seven, leading every hole across seventy-two to complete a wire-to-wire masterclass. The coastal winds of Portugal's Lisbon Coast proved unforgiving, with forty-one zero-point holes scattered across the field.

Patterson commanded from Round 2 onwards, building a ten-point cushion before a catastrophic twenty-two-point drop in Round 3 nearly handed the Trophy to Alex Baker. Baker mounted a furious final-round charge with forty-four points, briefly seizing the lead on the fourteenth. Patterson's forty-seven-point recovery sealed the title. Stuart Neumann collected his second Wooden Spoon, finishing forty-one points adrift.

The split between competitions told its own story. While Patterson led fifty-four of seventy-two holes for the Trophy, Mullin's Gross dominance was absolute, never trailing across four rounds.

## Round 1: Calamity at Royal Óbidos {.round1 .round}

Seve Ballesteros' final design proved a brutal opening examination, with blow-ups littering the leaderboard from the first hole. The parkland layout near Obidos offered little mercy in blustery conditions. Jon Baker led by a single point as darkness fell.

The carnage began immediately. Gregg Williams carded nine at the opening hole, Alex Baker followed with triple bogey. Baker's torment continued: blow-ups at the second, twelfth and fourteenth left him scrambling. Stuart Neumann suffered four zero-point holes. Patterson, one behind Baker in the Stableford, endured a ten at the fourth before recovering with four points at the fifth and a birdie at the seventeenth.

The closing hole provided late drama. Jon Baker's nine dropped him from the Gross lead. Mullin claimed the Jacket with a regulation par. Williams joined the carnage with his second blow-up of the day.

Baker held a fragile one-point advantage. Patterson and Mullin sat tied for second on thirty-eight points. The stage was set.

## Round 2: Patterson breaks clear at Praia D'El Rey {.round2 .round}

Cabell Robinson's spectacular links-parkland hybrid stretched along the Atlantic dunes. Patterson seized control with forty-nine points, building a commanding ten-point cushion. Mullin maintained his Gross lead with steady authority.

Jon Baker's defence collapsed at the opening hole. Seven and a blob handed the Trophy lead to Patterson. Mullin briefly led after a par at the second before Patterson reclaimed top spot on the eleventh. Three birdies across holes seven, twelve and seventeen underscored his dominance.

Alex Baker climbed to second with forty-four points despite early struggles. Williams suffered catastrophically at the ninth: ten and a blob. Stuart Neumann's run of four consecutive zero-point holes from the ninth to the thirteenth left him anchored to the bottom.

Patterson's back nine surge produced thirty points. Baker and Mullin split the consolation positions. The debutant looked unstoppable.

## Round 3: Catastrophic collapse threatens Patterson {.round3 .round}

Royal Óbidos returned with vengeance as Patterson's game imploded. Four zero-point holes produced a twenty-two-point drop, the worst by any Trophy leader in TEG history. His lead evaporated to three points. Mullin extended his Jacket advantage with ruthless consistency.

The nightmare began at the third: six and a blob. Triple bogey at the fourth followed. Eight at the twelfth brought another zero. The eighteenth completed the horror show. From forty-nine points to thirty-four. His cushion reduced to scraps.

Alex Baker capitalised brilliantly with forty-two points, split evenly across both nines. Williams and Neumann joined the chase on thirty-eight and thirty-seven respectively. Jon Baker collected three blobs. Mullin's solitary disaster at the tenth, a nine, barely dented his Gross command.

Patterson clung to first place by his fingernails. Baker lurked. The Trophy hung by a thread.

## Round 4: Recovery masterclass seals maiden Trophy {.round4 .round}

Patterson answered his critics with forty-seven points at Praia D'El Rey, extending his lead to six and securing the Trophy. Mullin cruised to his seventh Jacket by ten strokes. Baker's pursuit fell agonisingly short.

The final drama arrived mid-round. Patterson's nine at the fifth threatened another meltdown. Four points at the sixth steadied the ship. Baker surged ahead on the fourteenth with consecutive birdies at the eighth and thirteenth powering his charge. Blow-ups at the fifteenth and sixteenth ended his challenge. Patterson's birdie at the twelfth locked down the title.

Williams suffered the round's most catastrophic moment: eleven at the seventh for his third zero-point hole. Neumann's birdie at the thirteenth briefly enlivened his Spoon battle. Jon Baker's nine at the seventeenth summed up a frustrating finale.

The debutant held firm. Mullin never looked threatened. Baker's heroics proved insufficient.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

John Patterson's maiden Trophy triumph will be remembered less for its dominance than for the extraordinary resilience required to defend it. After establishing a ten-point lead through Round 2, his twenty-two-point collapse in Round 3 represented the worst single-round drop by any Trophy leader in TEG history. Four zero-point holes at Royal Óbidos nearly cost him everything. His forty-seven-point recovery in Round 4 showcased the mental fortitude that defines champions.

David Mullin's seventh Green Jacket extended his record haul with characteristic authority. Leading all seventy-two holes, he never wavered. His consistency across the four rounds, ranging from thirty-three to thirty-nine points, provided a masterclass in eliminating errors. The ten-stroke Jacket margin underscored his Gross superiority.

Alex Baker's campaign deserved better. Career-best rounds of forty-four points in Rounds 2 and 4 propelled him to second place, six points shy of Patterson. His brief Round 4 lead on the fourteenth demonstrated attacking intent, but consecutive blow-ups at the fifteenth and sixteenth ended his challenge. Jon Baker's opening-round leadership proved fleeting as consistency deserted him. Stuart Neumann collected his second Wooden Spoon, forty-one points behind the winner.

The Portuguese coast extracted a heavy toll: forty-one zero-point holes across the field, with only twelve birdies recorded in four hundred and thirty-two attempts. Patterson's journey from debutant to Trophy winner, via the worst collapse in recorded history, defines TEG 9.
