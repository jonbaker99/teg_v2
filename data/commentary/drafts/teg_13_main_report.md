## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker secured his third TEG Trophy and third Green Jacket with a performance of complete control across Kent's finest links. The formidable Royal Cinque Ports hosted the opening round. He led every single hole of the tournament in both competitions. No lead changes occurred across 72 holes. This was dominance of the rarest order. Gregg Williams pursued relentlessly, briefly claiming the Trophy lead at the 15th in Round 2, but finished second in both competitions. John Patterson's wild swings from a 49-point round to eagle-and-blow-up chaos defined volatility. David Mullin's fall from eight-time Jacket winner to Wooden Spoon holder, sealed by a quintuple bogey on the penultimate round's 10th hole, provided the tournament's starkest subplot.

## Round 1: Opening Salvo at Royal Cinque Ports {.round1 .round}

The championship links at Deal provided a formidable opening test, particularly when the coastal wind stiffened. Baker and Williams shared both leads after the opening hole with regulation pars worth three points apiece. The battle for supremacy would be settled quickly.

Williams lost both leads at the second hole with a triple bogey. Baker struck immediately. His birdie at the par-five third gave him breathing room. Williams endured another horror at the same hole, taking eight. That was a seven-over stretch for holes two through four. Baker never trailed again. Patterson's round disintegrated with blow-ups at the seventh, 10th and 16th, including a quintuple at the seventh. Alex Baker suffered back-to-back disasters at the 11th and 12th, taking eight then seven.

Williams rallied on the inward half with a birdie at the 15th, claiming five points. Baker blotted his copybook at the same hole with a triple. That was a fleeting wobble. Baker's front nine of 23 points had built an unassailable platform. He closed with 39 points and a 13-over-par gross score. Williams finished at 33 points, trailing by six.

## Round 2: Drama at Prince's {.round2 .round}

The Dunes and Himalayas nines at Prince's presented a different challenge, with Mackenzie and Ebert's design offering strategic complexity. Baker held a comfortable six-point Trophy lead and nine-stroke Jacket advantage. Williams needed a statement round.

Baker opened with a birdie at the sixth but immediately surrendered it with a blow-up at the 11th. Williams made his move. He played holes 11 through 16 in level par, collecting 18 points. At the 15th, Williams carded four points while Baker took eight. Williams seized the Trophy lead. The advantage lasted precisely one hole. Baker birdied the 18th for four points while Patterson imploded with a triple. That was Patterson's sixth blow-up of the round, the worst performance of the day in both competitions.

Williams had posted the day's best round with 41 points and 14-over gross. Magnificent. Not enough. Baker's 36 points restored his Trophy lead by a single point. The Jacket margin remained comfortable at nine strokes. Williams had given everything and still trailed.

## Round 3: Patterson's Brilliance Amid Baker's Extension {.round3 .round}

Littlestone's Championship Links, refined by Braid and MacKenzie on the Romney Marshes, demanded precision. Baker's one-point Trophy lead remained precarious. Williams briefly grabbed the lead at the opening hole before immediately surrendering it with a triple bogey at the second.

Patterson produced the round of the tournament. His birdie at the fourth sparked an extraordinary spell. He collected 18 points between holes eight and 13. His 49-point total vaulted him from fifth to joint third in the Trophy standings. It was the best gross and net performance of Round 3. Baker responded with his own birdie at the ninth, maintaining control with 44 points. That extended his Trophy lead to five points.

Alex Baker struggled with four blow-ups and three zero-point holes. David Mullin's triple at the 14th signalled growing vulnerability. Williams remained in touch with 40 points but had lost ground. Baker's Jacket lead stretched to 14 strokes. The gaps were widening.

## Round 4: Coronation and Collapse {.round4 .round}

The Shore and Dunes combination at Prince's would determine the final margins and the Wooden Spoon recipient. Baker held a five-point Trophy lead and 14-stroke Jacket advantage. Barring catastrophe, both titles were his.

Patterson provided the round's most dramatic sequence. He eagled the par-five second for five points. Immediately afterwards, he triple-bogeyed the third. That was eagle to nothing in two swings. He added blow-ups at the 12th and 15th, taking nine at the latter. Mullin's tournament ended in calamity. He took nine at the 10th, a quintuple bogey worth no points. That sealed the Wooden Spoon for an eight-time Jacket winner. Alex Baker briefly occupied the Spoon position before Mullin's disaster.

Alex Baker salvaged pride with the day's best round of 44 points. Williams closed with 38 points, finishing strongly on the back nine with 22 points. Baker secured 39 points and 13-over gross, posting identical numbers to his opening round. The consistency was remarkable. He finished six points clear in the Trophy, 18 strokes ahead in the Jacket.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's third TEG Trophy and third Green Jacket were secured through a masterclass in sustained excellence. Leading every hole of every round in both competitions represented an unprecedented level of control. Williams mounted the only serious challenge, briefly holding the Trophy lead for a single hole in Round 2, but could never sustain the pressure. His second-place finishes in both competitions, six points and 18 strokes behind respectively, marked a valiant pursuit that ultimately fell short.

Patterson's tournament oscillated between brilliance and chaos. His 49-point Round 3 hauled him from fifth to joint third in the Trophy standings. His eagle-to-blow-up sequence in Round 4 epitomised the volatility. He finished joint third despite registering 14 blow-ups across 72 holes, the most erratic performance statistically. Alex Baker joined Patterson on 141 points for Trophy bronze.

David Mullin's fall from grace provided the tournament's saddest arc. An eight-time Green Jacket winner claimed his first Wooden Spoon after the quintuple bogey at Round 4's 10th sealed his fate. From champion to last place. The margin from first to fifth spanned 23 points and 56 strokes, testament to Baker's comprehensive superiority. Kent's links courses had witnessed dominance of the purest kind.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}

Posted rounds of 39, 36, 44, and 39 points with gross scores of 13, 16, eight, and 13 over par. Five birdies and six blow-ups across 72 holes reflected steady rather than spectacular golf.

**Gregg Williams (2nd Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Mounted the only serious challenge with 152 points and 18-over gross. Briefly held the Trophy lead at Round 2's 15th hole but could not sustain it. His 41-point second round was the best of that day. Finished six points and 18 strokes behind the winner despite relentless pursuit.

**Alex Baker (T3 Trophy):** Joint third in the Trophy with 141 points but fourth in the Jacket at 103 over. Struggled with consistency throughout, including back-to-back blow-ups in Round 1 and four disasters in Round 3. Rallied with the best Round 4 performance of 44 points to salvage bronze.

**John Patterson (T3 Trophy):** Shared third in the Trophy with 141 points despite the most volatile play of the tournament. His 49-point Round 3 vaulted him from fifth to the podium. An eagle at Round 4's second was immediately followed by a triple at the third. Fourteen blow-ups across four rounds told the story.

**David Mullin (Wooden Spoon):** An eight-time Green Jacket winner claimed his first Wooden Spoon after a stunning collapse. Finished with 135 points and 80 over par. The quintuple bogey at Round 4's 10th hole sealed the inglorious outcome. From champion to last place in brutal fashion.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire dominance without a single lead change across 72 holes marked only the second such occurrence in TEG history. His eight-point round range between 36 and 44 reflected remarkably steady scoring. Williams led five holes across the tournament but only the 15th in Round 2 actually gave him the Trophy lead. Patterson's 21-point round range, from 28 to 49, represented the widest scoring variance of the tournament. The final Trophy margin of six points and Jacket margin of 18 strokes were both comfortable victories. Mullin's collapse from perennial contender to Wooden Spoon recipient marked the most dramatic fall from grace in recent TEG history.
