## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

Jon Baker completed TEG's first sweep of Kent's championship links, leading every hole of all four rounds to claim both Trophy and Green Jacket. The Deal-based architect of this dominance finished six points clear in the Stableford and eighteen strokes ahead in the Gross. His consistency proved decisive across four demanding courses that tested every facet of links golf. Gregg Williams challenged throughout, twice seizing the Trophy lead only to surrender it minutes later, finishing runner-up in both competitions. John Patterson authored the tournament's most dramatic subplot: a catastrophic opening act followed by a 49-point masterclass, then an eagle-to-blow-up finale that epitomised his wild ride. David Mullin, despite nine career Jackets, collected his fourth Spoon after a ninth at the tenth in the final round sealed his fate.

## Round 1: Opening Salvoes at Royal Cinque Ports {.round1 .round}

Royal Cinque Ports provided the opening test, a formidable championship links on the Deal coastline that once hosted the Open. The field faced one of Kent's toughest examinations, particularly exposed to coastal winds. Stakes were immediately clear: establish early authority or spend three rounds chasing.

The first hole produced instant drama. Both Baker and Williams registered three points. Williams held the lead. For approximately four minutes. Baker's birdie at the par-five third put him ahead for good, though nobody knew it yet. Williams endured immediate torment, posting nought at both the second and third to fall back. Patterson's quintuple bogey at the seventh announced his nightmare start. He followed with another eight at the tenth. Alex Baker contributed eights at the eleventh and twelfth, a grim sequence that left him eight over for those two holes alone.

Baker's front nine delivered 23 points. That cushion absorbed a triple bogey at the fifteenth, allowing him to navigate the closing stretch comfortably. Williams rallied with a birdie at the fifteenth, collecting ten points over the final three holes to salvage respectability. Patterson limped home with 28 points, his round featuring three zeros in a six-hole stretch.

## Round 2: Drama Unfolds at Prince's {.round2 .round}

The Dunes and Himalayas nines at Prince's offered a different examination, a 27-hole championship links preparing to host the 2030 Walker Cup. Baker held a six-point Trophy cushion and a nine-stroke Jacket margin. Williams had other ideas.

Williams constructed a magnificent back nine, accumulating eighteen points across holes eleven through sixteen. At the par-five fifteenth he registered four points, level par but crucially gaining ground. He took the Trophy lead. Baker stood one behind. One hole later, Williams could only par the short sixteenth. Baker matched him. The lead returned. Then came the decisive moment: Baker's birdie at the final hole, a four-pointer that reclaimed full control and left Williams one point adrift.

Patterson's misery continued. Eights at the first, third, seventeenth and eighteenth contributed to another 28-point return. He'd now posted 56 points across 36 holes, an average suggesting sustained struggle. Alex Baker managed 34 points despite a triple bogey at the tenth, his front nine yielding 21 points before the back nine collapse.

## Round 3: Patterson's Redemption at Littlestone {.round3 .round}

Littlestone Golf Club, a classic remote links on the Romney Marshes designed by Royal St George's architect William Laidlaw Purves, provided the third act. Baker's single-point Trophy lead appeared vulnerable. His Jacket margin stood at seven strokes over Williams.

Patterson exploded. His 49-point round, the tournament's best, featured a birdie at the fourth and relentless accumulation of fours and threes. He collected eighteen points across holes eight through thirteen, steady rather than spectacular but devastatingly effective. A triple bogey at the seventeenth barely dented his momentum. He'd climbed from fifth to third, erasing the nightmare of 56 points in two rounds with one transcendent performance.

Baker posted 44 points, his most complete round yet. A birdie at the ninth anchored a six-hole stretch that yielded eighteen points. Williams managed 40 points, solid but insufficient to close the gap. The Trophy lead stretched to five points. Alex Baker and Mullin both struggled to 32 points, falling further behind as the tournament entered its final act.

## Round 4: Baker's Coronation at Prince's {.round4 .round}

The Shore and Dunes combination at Prince's, considered the club's strongest routing, hosted the finale. Baker required merely steady golf to secure his sweep. Williams needed a miracle. Patterson's volatility suggested further drama.

Patterson provided it immediately. An eagle at the par-five second, a rare five-pointer. One hole later, a triple bogey at the short third. Zero points. The pattern continued: another eight at the twelfth, then a nine at the fifteenth, four over par and pointless. His round distilled the entire tournament into eighteen holes of extremes.

Mullin's Spoon was sealed at the tenth. A nine, five over par, representing total collapse on a par four. He'd averaged close to three over per round across the week, a stark contrast to his nine career Jackets. Baker briefly wobbled with a triple bogey at the tenth, then a double bogey at the sixteenth, but a birdie at the seventeenth steadied the ship. Thirty-nine points matched his opening round, perfect symmetry for a perfect week.

Williams finished with 38 points, respectable but seventeen points shy across four rounds. Alex Baker posted the day's best Stableford score, 44 points, but finished seventeen behind his brother in the Trophy race.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

Jon Baker's control was absolute. He led all 72 holes of the Trophy competition and all 72 holes of the Jacket race, never trailing once across four days on Kent's championship links. His six-point Trophy margin and eighteen-stroke Jacket advantage represented dominance of a rare order, built on relentless consistency rather than spectacular fireworks. Five birdies and only six zeros across 72 holes told the story: steady accumulation, minimal carnage, perfect execution of the wire-to-wire blueprint.

Gregg Williams endured the agony of double runner-up, having twice held the Trophy lead for fleeting moments in rounds one and two. His challenge ultimately foundered on too many costly mistakes, unable to sustain the pressure required to dislodge a leader who refused to crack. John Patterson's tournament defied conventional narrative: 56 points in two rounds, 49 in the third, wild swings between eagles and quintuple bogeys, a climb from fifth to joint third despite sustained chaos. His consistency was his inconsistency.

David Mullin collected his fourth Spoon, the catastrophic ninth at the tenth in round four sealing a fate that seemed improbable for a nine-time Jacket winner. Alex Baker tied for third in the Trophy but finished fourth in the Jacket, his best round of 44 points bookending his worst of 31. Baker's fifty over par represented the lowest Gross score in TEG history, breaking the previous mark by eighteen strokes. Perfect command, perfectly executed.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Jon Baker's fifty over par represented not only the lowest Gross score in TEG history but also the most consistent performance, his scores varying less than any other competitor. His four-round Stableford total of 158 points marked the second-highest points accumulation at any multi-venue championship. Gregg Williams' 152 points would have won most TEG events but proved insufficient against Baker's relentless accumulation. John Patterson's 49-point round three stood as the tournament's single best Stableford return, yet his overall finish reflected wild variation rather than sustained excellence. The Kent links proved worthy hosts for TEG's first visit to England's southeast, Royal Cinque Ports and Prince's providing examinations that tested every facet of championship golf.
