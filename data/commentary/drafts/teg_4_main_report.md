## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

David Mullin became the first player to sweep both competitions at TEG 4, claiming his second Trophy and third Green Jacket with a commanding three-point victory in East Sussex. Royal Ashdown Forest's bunkerless heathland layout opened the tournament in spectacular fashion. Mullin seized control midway through and never relinquished it, holding firm through a chaotic finale.

Jon Baker led or co-led for 49 of 72 holes before suffering a catastrophic final-nine collapse, including an 11 at the par-five 15th. Henry Meller's tournament-best 36-point second round briefly created a tied leaderboard, sparking a three-way battle that produced ten lead changes. Gregg Williams endured a woeful week, never recovering from six first-round blow-ups to claim his first career Wooden Spoon.

The tournament visited four new courses across East Sussex and Surrey, showcasing heathland and parkland challenges that tested every facet of the field's game.

## Round 1: Ashdown's Bunkerless Challenge {.round1 .round}

Royal Ashdown Forest's unique layout, devoid of a single bunker and perched high above sea level, set the stage for an opening round of dramatic swings. Williams surged to an early lead with a four-point opener and a birdie at the fourth, only to see his advantage evaporate. Baker lurked ominously, waiting for his moment.

The 11th proved pivotal. Henry Meller posted a catastrophic 12, the tournament's worst single hole. Stuart Neumann recorded a seven for nought. Williams also stumbled with a six. Baker capitalised, and by the 15th had claimed the Trophy lead. His advantage grew when he avoided the carnage at the 14th, where disaster found him instead in the form of a nine. Still, he held firm through the closing stretch.

David Morrison added two birdies to stay within range. Mullin, meanwhile, posted a solid 91 to lead the Jacket standings by three strokes. Williams, despite his bright start, leaked six blow-ups in all and fell to fifth in the Gross standings.

Baker closed with 35 points, four clear of Morrison. Mullin's steady 23-over left him leading the Jacket by three. The field dispersed to Surrey's parkland challenge at Lingfield with the leaderboard wide open.

## Round 2: Meller Surges to Share the Lead {.round2 .round}

Lingfield's mature parkland and strategic water hazards provided a different challenge, and Meller answered emphatically. His 36-point round, the tournament's finest, vaulted him from fourth into a tie for the Trophy lead. Mullin matched his surge with a 33-point effort, closing the four-point gap to join Meller atop the leaderboard. Baker's lead had evaporated.

Baker began brightly with the round's only birdie at the third, a five-pointer. But his momentum stalled late. A nine at the 17th cost him the lead, and he finished one point adrift. Mullin suffered his own stumble, recording blow-ups at the 17th and 18th, but his earlier steadiness kept him level with Meller.

Williams continued to struggle, posting eight over on holes seven through nine, including blow-ups at the eighth and ninth. Neumann, who had held early promise, recorded blow-ups at the first and second to slip to fifth. The Trophy standings showed a genuine three-way battle brewing.

Meller and Mullin shared the Trophy lead on 64 points. Baker sat one back. In the Jacket race, Mullin extended his advantage to four strokes over Meller, with Neumann a further five behind. The tournament headed to Crowborough Beacon's heathland with everything to play for.

## Round 3: Baker Reclaims Trophy by a Single Point {.round3 .round}

Crowborough Beacon's MacKenzie-redesigned holes and high-elevation challenge produced a round of brutal attrition. Baker posted 39 points to reclaim the Trophy lead by a single stroke. Mullin, posting 37, kept pace in second. Meller's challenge crumbled with five blow-ups.

Meller lost the lead immediately. A seven at the first yielded nothing. Baker pounced at the second, taking the lead with a three-point five. Mullin answered at the tenth, briefly seizing control, but lost it a hole later. The lead changed hands four times as the round unfolded. Baker's steadiness on holes 11 through 13, including a four-point return at the 12th, proved decisive.

The 15th hole delivered carnage. All four front-runners posted blow-ups and zero points. Williams, already struggling near the bottom, avoided the very worst with a par to escape last place on the final hole. Neumann picked up the pieces with a birdie at the fifth and 32 points overall, keeping his Jacket hopes alive.

Baker led the Trophy by one point over Mullin, with Meller and Neumann tied for third. Mullin held a commanding six-stroke Jacket lead. Bletchingley's parkland awaited, with everything still to be decided.

## Round 4: Mullin Dominates As Baker Collapses Spectacularly {.round4 .round}

Bletchingley's fast-running parkland became the stage for one of TEG's most dramatic finales. Mullin posted 36 points and 19-over to sweep both competitions. Baker, carrying a one-point Trophy lead into the round, imploded on the back nine. His collapse handed Mullin the double.

Baker started superbly. A birdie at the second gave him breathing room. At the eighth, he produced the tournament's only eagle, a stunning two at the par four. He led comfortably. Then came the horror stretch. A seven at the tenth. A nine at the par-three 12th. A seven at the 14th.

At the 15th, Baker posted an 11. Six over par. Zero points. His lead vanished. Mullin seized control at the 14th and never looked back, posting steady numbers to finish three points clear. Meller rallied with 34 points, including a birdie at the sixth, to claim runner-up honours. Neumann's 32 secured second in the Jacket.

Williams endured another dreadful showing, posting 43-over and 23 points. Blow-ups at the fifth, sixth, 13th, and 14th left him with his worst round yet. He finished on 110 points and 152-over, claiming the Wooden Spoon by ten points. Baker, who had led for so long, salvaged 32 points to finish second in the Trophy but fourth in the Jacket.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

David Mullin's double triumph marked a new milestone for TEG. He led the Jacket from start to finish and seized the Trophy at the decisive moment. His consistency proved unbeatable. Across four rounds and four distinct courses, he posted 137 points and 81-over, a dominant performance by any measure. He became the first player to hold both trophies simultaneously.

Jon Baker's tournament will be remembered for what might have been. He led or co-led for 49 holes. His eagle at the fourth-round eighth showcased his brilliance. But the back-nine collapse, anchored by that 11 at the 15th, undid all his good work. He finished three points behind Mullin in the Trophy and 32 strokes back in the Jacket.

Henry Meller's second round, a sparkling 36 points, briefly made him co-leader. His subsequent struggles, particularly five blow-ups in Round 3, left him third in both competitions. Stuart Neumann's steady play earned him fourth in the Trophy and second in the Jacket. Gregg Williams, plagued by 14 blow-ups across the week, claimed his first Wooden Spoon with a tournament-worst 152-over performance. East Sussex and Surrey had delivered drama, chaos, and ultimately, Mullin's coronation.
