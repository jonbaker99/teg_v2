## TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW {.tournament-overview}

David Mullin claimed both Trophy and Jacket at TEG 4, becoming the first player to complete the double sweep in the tournament's brief history. His three-point victory came courtesy of Jon Baker's catastrophic final-round collapse, which saw the former champion surrender a lead he'd held or shared for 49 holes. Baker's back-nine implosion featured an 11 at the 15th and a nine at the 12th, transforming a one-point advantage into a three-point defeat. East Sussex provided the dramatic backdrop for this inaugural visit to England's south coast, with four new venues testing the field across 72 holes.

The tournament witnessed ten lead changes from Round 2 onwards. Henry Meller's Round 2 surge with 36 points vaulted him into a tie atop the leaderboard, creating the first co-leadership in tournament history. Gregg Williams collected his first career Wooden Spoon after averaging 38 over par across four rounds, registering 14 blow-ups in total.

## Round 1: Baker Survives Ashdown Carnage {.round1 .round}

Royal Ashdown Forest's bunkerless heathland layout relied on natural features for its challenge. The course extracted a heavy toll. Jon Baker emerged with a four-point cushion despite his own blow-up at the 14th.

Williams opened with a four-point salvo and a birdie at the eighth to seize both Trophy and Jacket leads. His momentum evaporated spectacularly. Williams recorded six blow-ups across 18 holes, including a triple at the 17th that saw him plummet down the standings. The middle holes proved murderous. Henry Meller's 12 at the par-three 11th stood as the round's defining calamity, a nine-over-par disaster that torpedoed his challenge before it began. Stuart Neumann joined Meller in recording a seven at the same hole, then immediately followed with another seven at the 12th.

Baker's own blow-up at the 14th cost him five strokes and registered nought on the scorecard. He steadied thereafter. David Morrison posted two birdies but couldn't sustain consistent scoring after his own blow-ups at the 12th. Baker's 35 points opened a four-point gap over Morrison, with Williams third despite his late collapse.

## Round 2: Meller's Surge Creates Tie {.round2 .round}

Lingfield's parkland test produced the tournament's best round and its first tied leaderboard. Henry Meller stormed through with 36 points to vault from fourth into a share of the Trophy lead. David Mullin matched his total in terms of leadership, closing a four-point gap to join Meller on 64 points.

Baker managed just one birdie, at the third, where his five points briefly extended his advantage. The back nine unravelled. A blow-up at the 14th cost him the Trophy lead. Mullin seized it momentarily at the 11th before losing it a hole later. Lead changes came in rapid succession as each contender faltered. Baker's nine at the 17th cemented his fall from the summit.

Williams recorded blow-ups at three holes in the opening nine, including a nine at the third. His 31 points kept him within striking distance. Neumann suffered early with blow-ups at the first and second, including a nine at the par-five second. He never recovered from those opening holes.

Meller's steady accumulation across 18 holes lifted him level with Mullin atop the Trophy standings. Morrison's Jacket lead had evaporated. Mullin now controlled the Gross competition outright.

## Round 3: Baker Reclaims Slender Lead {.round3 .round}

Crowborough Beacon's elevated heathland brought MacKenzie design and spectacular views. It also delivered chaos. Baker posted 39 points to edge back ahead by a single point, whilst Mullin maintained iron control of the Jacket with another steady round.

Meller lost the co-lead immediately. A seven at the opening hole registered nought. Baker took the Trophy lead at the second with a three-point bogey. Mullin reclaimed it at the tenth with a three-point par at the par five. He lost it again a hole later. The pendulum swung relentlessly. Four players managed nought at the 15th, a collective implosion that scrambled the standings. Williams finally escaped bottom place on the final hole after blow-ups at five holes during the round.

Baker's 39 points came via consistent accumulation rather than fireworks. His front nine yielded 22 points. The back nine registered 17 despite blow-ups at the tenth and 18th. Mullin's 37 points kept him within a point. Neumann posted the round's only birdie, a four-pointer at the fifth, but blow-ups at the tenth and 11th prevented a serious challenge. Williams averaged eight over for the opening six holes, recording blow-ups at the second, fourth and fifth.

Baker led by one. Mullin lurked. The stage was set.

## Round 4: Baker's Nightmare Hands Mullin The Double {.round4 .round}

Bletchingley's modern parkland design provided fast conditions and undulating terrain. Baker's tournament ended in ruins. Jon Baker began the final round nursing a one-point Trophy lead. His front nine featured brilliance. A birdie at the second yielded four points. His eagle at the eighth, a rare two at the par four, delivered five more points and extended his advantage. Twenty-three points across nine holes suggested a coronation.

The back nine brought carnage. Baker recorded a nine at the par-three 12th for six over. He followed with another blow-up at the 14th. Then came the 15th. Eleven strokes. Six over par. Nought points. His lead evaporated instantly. Mullin seized control at the 14th and never relinquished it.

Baker's cold spell from the ninth onwards averaged nearly four over per hole. His final-nine total of nine points contrasted savagely with his opening 23. The collapse handed Mullin both competitions. Meller posted 34 points to claim second place in the Trophy. Neumann's 22 over par secured Jacket runner-up. Williams endured another torrid afternoon, blow-ups at four holes confirming his Wooden Spoon.

Mullin's 36-point final round matched his best of the week. His 19 over par gave him the Jacket by 19 strokes. The double sweep was complete.

## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}

David Mullin's double sweep at TEG 4 owed as much to Jon Baker's spectacular collapse as to his own consistency. Mullin led the Jacket for all 72 holes. His Trophy victory required Baker's late-round implosion. Baker held or shared the Trophy lead for 49 of 72 holes before succumbing to back-nine horrors at Bletchingley. His 11 at the 15th and nine at the 12th transformed a one-point advantage into a three-point defeat.

The tournament produced ten lead changes from Round 2 onwards. Henry Meller's 36-point second round vaulted him into a co-lead with Mullin, creating the first tied leaderboard in tournament history. Meller faded thereafter, his collapse at the 11th in Round 1 setting the tone for a week of wild swings. Stuart Neumann posted steady Gross scoring to claim Jacket runner-up, whilst Gregg Williams' 14 blow-ups across four rounds secured his first career Wooden Spoon. Williams averaged 38 over par per round, culminating in a 43 in the final round that tied his worst mark.

Baker's eagle at the eighth in Round 4 stood as the tournament's only one. The field combined for just seven birdies across 72 holes, with Baker and Morrison accounting for half of them. Mullin's victory margin of three points in the Trophy and 19 strokes in the Jacket represented the first simultaneous sweep since TEG's inception. His second Trophy and third Jacket confirmed his status as the tournament's early standard-bearer.

## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}

Jon Baker's final-round front nine of 23 points represented the second-highest nine-hole total at Bletchingley, surpassed only by David Mullin's consistency across both nines. Baker's subsequent collapse of nine points across the back nine marked the tournament's widest intra-round swing. Henry Meller's 36-point second round at Lingfield tied for the best single-round performance of the week. The tournament's lone eagle came at Bletchingley's par-four eighth, a rare feat that temporarily extended Baker's advantage before his subsequent meltdown. Royal Ashdown Forest's bunkerless design produced the week's most blow-ups in a single round, with 18 recorded across five players.
