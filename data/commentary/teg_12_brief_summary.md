## TEG 12: Patterson Prevails as Williams Collapses

**Catalonia, Spain, 2019.** PGA Catalunya's Tour and Stadium courses hosted a tournament of dramatic contrasts: John Patterson claimed his second Trophy with a record-breaking 172 points, while Jon Baker captured his second Green Jacket with a wire-to-wire +63 gross performance—third-best all-time.

Patterson seized control in Round 3 after Gregg Williams' catastrophic back-nine implosion. Williams had led the Trophy for 33 consecutive holes before a quintuple bogey on H13 (11/+7) ended his title defense. Patterson's consistency machine never wavered: four rounds between 40-45 points, extending to a commanding 10-point victory over Williams.

Baker's Jacket dominance was absolute—leading all 72 holes by 8 strokes over David Mullin. Yet Mullin's tournament epitomized golf's cruelty: he tied the Tour course record (84) in Round 2, finished runner-up in gross (+71), but claimed his third career Wooden Spoon with 139 points. Stuart Neumann provided the week's lone eagle in Round 4 at H15.
