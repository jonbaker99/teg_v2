**TEG 15: Lisbon Coast, Portugal (2022)**  
Four courses across the Lisbon Coast: Estoril, West Cliffs, Penha Longa, and Oitavos Dunes.

Gregg Williams swept both the Trophy and Green Jacket in wire-to-wire fashion, becoming the first player in tournament history to claim both titles. Williams never trailed across 72 holes, winning by 21 points and 29 strokes. His Round 3 score of 82 at Penha Longa set a new course record.

Stuart Neumann mounted a stunning recovery from last place after Round 1—where catastrophic blow-ups on H3 (9/+5) and H15 (10/+6) left him 18 points adrift—to claim runner-up with a tournament-best 43 points in Round 3. John Patterson's quintuple-bogey on the opening hole of Round 4 (10/+6) dropped him from second to third. David Mullin's final-round collapse (22 points, worst round in his tournament history) cost him third place despite his Round 2 eagle. Alex Baker finished last in both competitions for his second career Wooden Spoon.
