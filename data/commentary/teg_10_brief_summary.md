# TEG 10: Portugal 2017

**TEG Trophy Winner:** Alex Baker (184pts, +11 over Gregg Williams)  
**Green Jacket Winner:** David Mullin (+51, +12 over Jon Baker)

Portugal 2017 returned to the Algarve after a five-year gap, playing Boavista (Rounds 1 & 4) and two new Palmares combinations (Rounds 2 & 3).

Alex Baker claimed his first Trophy with a decisive second-half surge, seizing sole control after Round 3's multi-player scramble and breaking away with a tournament-record 51 points in the finale. David Mullin collected his ninth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance, leading all 72 holes to a 12-stroke margin despite a Round 3 collapse (31 points) that ended his Stableford bid. Both winners set new tournament recordsâ€”Baker's 184 points and Mullin's +51 gross.

The tournament featured ten lead changes before Baker's R4 breakaway. Gregg Williams led or co-led from Round 2 through Round 3 but fell 11 points short in his maiden Jacket bid. John Patterson endured the tournament's worst-ever finish: 112 points, 20 zero-scores, and a catastrophic 11 on Round 4's eighth hole.
