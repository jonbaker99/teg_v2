# TEG 11 - Catalonia 2018

Jon Baker swept both Trophy and Green Jacket in Spain, dominating for 70 of 72 holes to win by 6 points and 3 strokes. His consistency trumped the field's chaos across four rounds at PGA Catalunya and El Prat.

Alex Baker briefly led after Round 3 but suffered a career-worst collapse in Round 4—27 points with five blow-ups including zeros on holes 6 and 9. David Mullin earned his second Wooden Spoon (125 points, 18 behind) despite finishing second in the Jacket. John Patterson epitomized the tournament's volatility: eight disasters in Round 1 (+40) followed by a redemptive 39-point finale—the week's best round.

The four rounds in Catalonia produced 39 blow-ups and just six birdies across 360 holes played. Jon Baker's wire-to-wire dominance marked his first Green Jacket after two prior Trophy victories.
