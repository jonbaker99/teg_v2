# TEG 14: Mullin's Wire-to-Wire Masterclass

**Kent, England (2021)** — Royal Cinque Ports, Littlestone, Prince's Shore/Dunes

David Mullin claimed his third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket with a wire-to-wire victory, leading all 72 holes before holding off Alex Baker's furious final-round charge by just 2 points. Mullin's consistency—four birdies, 23 pars—anchored his dominant Gross performance (+68, 34-stroke margin), while his 154 Stableford points survived Baker's tournament-best 43-point closing round that nearly erased a 9-point deficit.

Defending champion Jon Baker's collapse from contender to his first career Wooden Spoon defined the tournament's chaos. Baker's 11 zero-point holes—including five blow-ups in Round 3 alone—dropped him to last place (125 points) despite setting Prince's Shore/Dunes course record with an 83 (+11) in Round 4 featuring four birdies. The tournament's carnage included 28 triple-bogeys or worse, capped by Alex Baker's catastrophic sextuple-bogey on the par-4 16th in the final round—a 10 that obliterated his comeback hopes.
