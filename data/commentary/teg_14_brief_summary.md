David Mullin claimed his third Trophy and tenth Green Jacket at TEG 14 in Kent, sweeping both competitions wire-to-wire. The 2-point Stableford margin marked the tightest Trophy finish in tournament history, while his 7-stroke Jacket victory proved comfortable.

Alex Baker's tournament-best 43-point finale nearly stole the Trophy, slashing Mullin's lead from 8 points to 2 in a furious final-round charge. Jon Baker earned his first Wooden Spoon, finishing 29 points behind in Stableford despite claiming second place in the Jacket at +75. Mullin led after all four rounds in both competitions, controlling 60 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross.

Mullin's tenth Green Jacket cements his dominance in the tournament's gross competition. The field played Royal Cinque Ports, Littlestone, and Prince's Shore/Dunes across four rounds in 2021.
