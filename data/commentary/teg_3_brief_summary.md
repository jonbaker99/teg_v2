# TEG 3: 2010, Algarve

Jon Baker claimed his first Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance at Boavista, leading all 72 holes and winning by 17 points over David Mullin. Mullin secured his second Green Jacket with a comfortable 12-stroke margin, leading from the fourth hole onwards.

Stuart Neumann's tournament collapsed on the 17th hole in Round 4—a quintuple bogey (10 strokes, +6) destroyed his Jacket hopes and dropped him to the Wooden Spoon with 135 points. Henry Meller produced the week's wildest swings: four birdies (tournament-high) but ten blow-ups cost him any chance at the Trophy, finishing fourth.

The tournament saw a birdie famine—just five across 360 holes played. Baker never faced a serious Trophy challenge, extending his lead each round (8→11→16→17 points). Mullin's worst round (+14 in Round 3) still left him in cruise control for the Jacket.
