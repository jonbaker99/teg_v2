Jon Baker claimed his first TEG Trophy in Portugal's Algarve in 2010, dominating wire-to-wire across four rounds at Boavista. Baker led all 72 Stableford holes, extending his margin each round (8→11→16→17 points) despite volatile scoring (36-45 points per round). David Mullin secured his second Green Jacket by 12 strokes, finishing runner-up in the Trophy by 17 points.

Mullin's consistency—never worse than 21 strokes per round—contrasted with Baker's extremes: two 45-point rounds bracketing his worst (36 points in Round 4). Henry Meller recorded four birdies but suffered twin meltdowns: a 12 on the 17th in Round 1, and a 10 on the par-5 3rd in Round 3.

Stuart Neumann earned his first Wooden Spoon with 135 points, while Gregg Williams accumulated 11 blow-ups for zero across the week.
