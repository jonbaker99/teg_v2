# TEG 16: Neumann's Wire-to-Wire Breakthrough in Portugal

Stuart Neumann claimed his first Trophy with crushing wire-to-wire dominance on the Lisbon Coast, leading all 72 holes and winning by 13 points over Gregg Williams. Williams secured his second Green Jacket by 16 strokes—also wire-to-wire—making TEG 16 the first tournament where both competitions were led from first hole to last by different players.

Neumann's victory erased three career Wooden Spoons, never trailing once as he posted consistent scores across Oitavos Dunes, Troia, Penha Longa, and Estoril. Williams posted the tournament's best gross performance at +66 (under par per hole), remarkably consistent across all four rounds with 30 pars in 72 holes. David Mullin's late surge—a tournament-best 45 points in Round 4—came too late, leaving him one point shy of Williams in second.

Alex Baker earned his third Wooden Spoon by 29 points, posting 13 zero-pointers across the week including a catastrophic +7 blow-up on Estoril's 12th hole in the final round. Jon Baker's challenge collapsed at Penha Longa's par-5 12th—a quintuple-bogey 10—part of a two-hole meltdown that cost him 19 points and any chance at silverware.
