**TEG 16 (2023) – Lisbon Coast, Portugal**

Stuart Neumann claimed his first Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory, leading all 72 holes and never threatened en route to a 13-point triumph. Gregg Williams earned his second Green Jacket, dominating the gross competition from start to finish with a commanding 16-stroke margin. The competitions split cleanly—Neumann's net dominance (156 points) and Williams's gross mastery (+66) unfolded simultaneously with zero drama after Round 1.

Alex Baker endured a nightmare week: 13 zero-point disasters including an 11 on Estoril's 12th earned him his third career Wooden Spoon, finishing 82 strokes back. David Mullin's brilliant final-round 45 points came too late, leaving him 14 points adrift. Only four players recorded birdies all week—Neumann led with three—while 52 combined blow-ups scarred the scorecard, 15 belonging to Baker alone.
