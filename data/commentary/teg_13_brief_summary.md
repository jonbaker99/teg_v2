# TEG 13: Baker's Wire-to-Wire Sweep

Jon Baker claimed his third Trophy and third Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance across four new Kent links courses in 2020. Leading all 72 holes in both competitions, Baker's 6-point Stableford margin over Gregg Williams and historic 18-stroke gross victory marked the most controlled performance in tournament history.

Williams challenged throughout, briefly seizing the Trophy lead twice—on the opening hole and late in Round 2—but couldn't sustain. He finished runner-up in both competitions. John Patterson's wild ride defined the week: a tournament-best 49 points in Round 3 sandwiched between a 28-point collapse and a quintuple bogey in Round 1, plus an eagle-to-triple sequence in the finale.

David Mullin sealed his fourth career Wooden Spoon with a catastrophic 9 (+5) on Round 4's 10th hole, finishing last despite being a nine-time Green Jacket champion. Baker's +50 gross remains the lowest score ever recorded in tournament play.
