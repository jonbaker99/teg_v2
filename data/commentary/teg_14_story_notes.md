# TEG 14 Story Notes

## Key Points
- David MULLIN's 3rd Trophy & 9th Green Jacket - swept both competitions, leading all 72 holes despite a narrow 2-point final margin
- Alex BAKER's late charge fell just short - closed gap from 9 points to 2 with 43-point final round but couldn't catch MULLIN
- MULLIN's 4 birdies and 23 pars anchored consistent performance (+68 gross) despite 6 blow-ups
- Jon BAKER's tournament collapse - defending champion plummeted from contention to Wooden Spoon (1st career) with 11 zero-point holes
- Catastrophic blow-ups defined the tournament - 28 triple bogeys or worse across field, including Alex BAKER's +6 on H16 (Par 4) in Round 4

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** DM 40pts leads by 3; DM +15 leads Gross by 5
- **Round 2:** DM extends to 9-point Trophy lead with 41pts; DM maintains Jacket dominance
- **Round 3:** DM's 36pts keeps 8-point Trophy cushion; blow-up fest with 11 disasters across field
- **Round 4:** AB's 43pts closes gap to 2 but MULLIN's 37pts holds off late charge; JB sets course record 83 gross

## Story Angles
- Wire-to-wire dominance meets nail-biting finish - MULLIN led every hole yet finished just 2 points ahead
- Defending champion's nightmare - Jon BAKER dropped from TEG 13 winner to first-ever Wooden Spoon with 11 blow-ups
- Tale of two competitions - MULLIN cruised in Gross (+68, 34-stroke margin) but held on by fingernails in Stableford
- Alex BAKER's heroic final round (43pts) nearly erased 9-point deficit but came up 2 points short
- Blow-up epidemic - 28 triple bogeys or worse, including Jon BAKER's 5 zero-pointers in R3 and Alex BAKER's catastrophic +6 on H16 (Par 4) in R4
- MULLIN's remarkable consistency - 4 birdies, 23 pars, led every round despite rough patches (R3: 3 blow-ups)

- "Defending champion to Wooden Spoon"
