# TEG 14 Story Notes

## Key Points
- David MULLIN's 3rd Trophy & 9th Green Jacket - swept both competitions with wire-to-wire dominance, never trailing across 72 holes
- Won by narrowest margin of tournament (2 points over Alex BAKER in Trophy, 7 strokes over Jon BAKER in Jacket)
- Alex BAKER's epic final-round surge (43pts) fell just short - closed from 9 points back but couldn't catch MULLIN
- Jon BAKER's contrasting fortunes - 2nd in Gross (+75) despite Wooden Spoon in Stableford (125pts), 5 birdies overall
- All four players recorded catastrophic blow-ups (10+) - trademark volatility

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** DM 40pts leads Trophy by 3; DM +15 leads Gross by 5
- **Round 2:** DM extends both leads with 41pts/+14 - now up 9pts (Trophy), 3 strokes (Jacket)
- **Round 3:** DM holds Trophy lead (8pts) despite struggles; GW's 39pts (best round) closes Jacket gap to 12
- **Round 4:** AB's tournament-best 43pts closes to 2pts but DM's 37pts holds on; JB's +11 best Gross round secures 2nd in Jacket

## Story Angles
- MULLIN's defensive masterclass - led from first hole but survived Alex BAKER's ferocious final-round charge
- The 2-point thriller - closest finish in Trophy despite MULLIN leading wire-to-wire (Alex BAKER's 43-point R4 nearly stole it)
- Jon BAKER's split personality - runner-up in Gross (+75) yet dead last in Stableford (125pts), only 29pts gap between 2nd/4th in Trophy
- Catastrophic blow-ups defined TEG 14 - every player hit 10+ on a hole (AB's +6 on H16 R4, GW's +4 on H3 R1, JB's +4 on H18 R4, DM avoided double-digit)
- MULLIN's consistency triumph - standard deviations of 2.94 (gross) and 2.38 (Stableford) steadiest in field despite 6 zero-point holes
- The birdie paradox - Jon BAKER led field with 5 birdies but won Wooden Spoon; MULLIN's 4 birdies won both titles
