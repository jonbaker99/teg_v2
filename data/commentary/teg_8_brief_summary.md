**TEG 8: Lisbon Coast, Portugal (2015)**

Gregg Williams claimed his third Trophy with a wire-to-wire masterclass, leading all 72 holes and cruising to a 12-point victory. David Mullin seized his seventh Green Jacket with a dramatic final-round comeback—trailing Jon Baker through 54 holes before overtaking him on R4 H2 and pulling clear by six strokes.

Jon Baker endured heartbreak in both competitions. His stellar Round 3 gross 18 (+2) secured the Jacket lead, only to surrender it when Mullin pounced on the second hole of the final round. Baker finished runner-up in both Trophy and Green Jacket, a double near-miss. Stuart Neumann collected his first Wooden Spoon with 100 points—49 behind Williams—after 23 zero-point holes across four rounds. Alex Baker's roller-coaster week epitomised the tournament's drama: a blistering 20-point front nine in R1 contrasted with a catastrophic 10 (+6) on R3 H8.

Four new courses debuted across Lisbon's coast, with Hole 10 at Quinta da Marinha emerging as the week's villain—four blow-ups in Round 1 alone, including both Bakers. Penha Longa's H12 and H16 continued the carnage in Round 2, claiming seven victims between them.
