[ ] Round commentary + speculation as to what's to come if tournament is in progress


[ ] now massively overboard on the FIRST EAGLE EVER stuff

[ ] Make sure there are good story notes? Review all of the story

[ ] work at round level as less data to digest? then build overall story from that

[ ] review the files generated for commentary, is it still useful? is it being used?

[ ] any new analysis for commentary should be used

-> the momentum should look at specific holes to illustrate or identify


is multipass dual level?
1 - data type
2 - round by round (+total tournament)
