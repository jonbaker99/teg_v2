# TEG 9: Patterson's Debut Masterclass Secures Historic Double Lead

## Tournament Summary

John Patterson arrived at the Lisbon Coast as a TEG debutant. He departed as a champion, having led the Stableford competition for 53 of 72 holes in a commanding performance that yielded his first Trophy by six points. Yet this tournament will be remembered as much for its contrasts as its victor—because while Patterson dominated the handicapped scoring, David Mullin authored an entirely separate masterpiece, claiming his eighth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire supremacy in gross scoring, leading all 72 holes save one catastrophic opening moment.

The pivotal moment arrived in Round 2 at Praia D'El Rey, where Patterson unleashed a 49-point eruption—tied for the greatest single round in tournament history. The ten-point margin it created seemed insurmountable, yet Alex Baker had other ideas. His late charge in the final round briefly saw him seize the Stableford lead at the 14th hole, offering a tantalizing glimpse of what might have been before Patterson steadied himself to claim victory by six. Baker's 162 points secured second place, while Mullin's Gross dominance (winning by ten strokes despite opening Round 4 with a quadruple bogey) illustrated perfectly how two distinct competitions can unfold simultaneously on the same fairways.

At the other end of the leaderboard, Stuart Neumann collected his third career Wooden Spoon despite a spirited final-round rally—finishing last in both competitions with 127 points and +125 gross. It was a tournament of extremes: Patterson's 15-point range between rounds (49 to 34) showcased volatility rewarded, while just eleven birdies total marked the fewest in tournament history through TEG 9. Jon Baker's opening-round 39 points briefly promised contention, but his challenge faded as Patterson's star rose. The debut champion had announced himself in emphatic fashion.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Royal Óbidos Chaos Sets the Stage

The tournament opened at Royal Óbidos in a state of delicious confusion, with the lead changing hands seven times across eighteen holes. Gregg Williams immediately plunged to the bottom of the Spoon race with a quintuple-bogey-or-worse opening disaster, while Alex Baker matched his misery at the second with a four-over calamity that briefly saw him sharing Williams' wooden ignominy. Patterson seized an early lead before his own disaster at the fourth (six over par) handed momentum to Williams of all people, who held the Stableford advantage for precisely one hole before Patterson's four points on the fifth reclaimed top spot.

By the turn, Jon Baker had surged into the dual lead in both competitions, but the back nine belonged to chaos theory. Stuart Neumann's nightmare stretch began at the tenth—disasters at 11, 12, 15, and 16 left him marooned at the bottom with just 23 points, his front-nine promise (17 points) utterly erased by a six-point back nine. Alex Baker's collapse was scarcely less dramatic, with disasters at 12 and 14 (a seven-over horror show) leaving him scrambling. Only David Mullin navigated the madness with calm purpose, his steady +15 gross score (including a perfect stretch from holes 13-15) allowing him to snatch the Gross lead on the 18th hole when Jon Baker carded a quad bogey.

Patterson's birdie at the 17th (four points) provided a glimpse of what was to come, but it was Jon Baker who emerged from the carnage atop the Stableford leaderboard on 39 points—a single point ahead of Mullin and Patterson (both 38). The margin was wafer-thin, the battle wide open. Mullin led by two strokes gross, with Baker on +17 giving chase.

**Round 1 scores:** JB 39pts/+17, DM 38pts/+15, JP 38pts/+28, AB 32pts/+43, GW 31pts/+35, SN 23pts/+42

### Round 2: Patterson's 49-Point Eruption Rewrites the Script

If Round 1 was chaos, Round 2 at Praia D'El Rey was biblical reckoning. Jon Baker's defence of his overnight lead lasted precisely one hole—a triple bogey handed Patterson the Stableford advantage, which the debutant would never relinquish. What followed was the finest individual round in tournament history: 49 points, matching the all-time record, delivered with a swagger that left the field gasping.

The destruction was surgical. Patterson's front nine (19 points) was merely prolific; his back nine (30 points) was historically dominant. Birdies at the seventh and twelfth anchored a stretch from holes 7-12 where he accumulated 20 points, while his run from 10-15 and 12-17 yielded identical 20-point hauls. The 49-point total came paired with a 14-gross round—tied with Mullin for the day's best absolute score—meaning Patterson had swept both leads by the 11th hole. His ten-point Stableford margin was the largest single-round gap all tournament.

Behind him, Alex Baker mounted a recovery charge with 44 points (including a strong 25-point front nine), climbing from fourth to second. Mullin's 39 points kept him in touching distance, though his bid for dual dominance had been crushed. Jon Baker's challenge imploded with a triple bogey at the seventh, while Stuart Neumann's disaster sequence from holes 11-13 (zero points, three consecutive catastrophes) left him with a grim 30-point total. Even Williams' 36 points couldn't save him from isolation in fifth place.

Patterson's lead was now ten points (87 to Baker's 76). Mullin's gross advantage had shrunk to nothing—he and Patterson were tied at +14, but Patterson's Stableford supremacy was the story. The debutant had seized control.

**Round 2 scores:** JP 49pts/+14, AB 44pts/+27, DM 39pts/+14, JB 37pts/+19, GW 36pts/+28, SN 30pts/+32

### Round 3: The Lead Shrinks as Royal Óbidos Bites Back

Royal Óbidos exacted revenge in Round 3, and Patterson bore the brunt. His 34-point round—a personal worst—featured disasters at the third, eighth, twelfth, and a quad-bogey finale at the 18th (zero points). The ten-point cushion deflated to just three as Alex Baker (42 points) continued his relentless pursuit, climbing from third to second overall. Baker's front-nine excellence (24 points) offset back-nine struggles, but his consistency was proving formidable.

Jon Baker briefly threatened relevance with an opening burst (18 points from holes 1-6, anchored by a birdie at the second), but his 34-point total merely matched Patterson's struggles. The back nine was brutal: disasters at the seventh and eleventh (quad bogey, zero points) yielded just six points across holes 7-12. Mullin, too, found disaster—a quintuple bogey at the tenth (nine on a par four, zero points) following a triple at the sixth—yet his 33 points and +22 gross round retained Gross supremacy. He'd extended his lead over Patterson to seven strokes (+51 vs +58) despite the carnage.

Williams (38 points) and Neumann (37) enjoyed their best rounds yet, but the Spoon race was Neumann's to lose, and he showed no sign of relinquishing it. The triple-bogey/zero-point pattern had become his calling card, this time at the fourth and 16th holes. At the top, Patterson's lead over Baker had been slashed from ten to three (159 to 156). One strong Baker round and a single Patterson stumble, and the debutant's dream would evaporate.

**Round 3 scores:** JP 34pts/+29, AB 42pts/+30, JB 34pts/+22, DM 33pts/+22, GW 38pts/+25, SN 37pts/+26

### Round 4: Baker's Brief Glory and Patterson's Steady Triumph

Praia D'El Rey hosted the denouement, and it delivered drama worthy of the stage. Mullin's quest for Gross perfection nearly derailed immediately—a quad bogey at the opening hole (zero points, four over par) was the kind of disaster that shatters concentration—yet he steadied brilliantly, carding pars at holes 2-4 and 7-9 to reassert control. His 16-gross final round secured the Green Jacket by ten strokes (+67 total), a wire-to-wire dominance marred by a single moment of madness.

The Stableford race, meanwhile, produced genuine theatre. Patterson's opening nine was solid rather than spectacular, but disaster lurked—a quintuple bogey at the fifth (zero points) was the kind of score that ends champions' dreams. Yet his advantage held. Then came the surge: Baker's six-hole masterclass from holes 8-13 (21 points, featuring birdies at the eighth and 13th) was the finest golf of the final day. When Baker's birdie at the 13th dropped, he'd taken the lead for the first time since Jon Baker's brief Round 1 reign. One hole of glory. One fleeting taste of what might have been.

But Patterson, weathering the storm with a birdie of his own at the 12th (four points), responded with the cool of a veteran rather than the nerves of a debutant. By the 14th hole, Baker had dropped back. His 44-point round (matching his Round 2 best) wasn't quite enough—Patterson's 47 points extended the gap back to six. Jon Baker's 36 and Williams' 38 (despite a sextuple-bogey catastrophe at the seventh) completed respectable tournaments, while Neumann's 37 points—buoyed by a birdie at the 13th and a strong back nine (21 points)—at least salvaged pride in defeat.

Patterson finished on 168 points, +88 gross. Baker's 162 points secured second, while Mullin's 148 points and +67 gross captured his eighth Green Jacket. The debutant had led for 53 of 72 Stableford holes. The veteran had led all 72 Gross holes bar one. Two competitions, two champions, one unforgettable tournament.

**Round 4 scores:** JP 47pts/+17, AB 44pts/+27, DM 38pts/+16, GW 38pts/+27, JB 36pts/+19, SN 37pts/+25

## Tournament Recap

TEG 9 will be remembered for its elegant duality—John Patterson's Stableford mastery running parallel to David Mullin's Gross dominance, like twin narratives that never quite converged. Patterson's debut Trophy came via a 49-point Round 2 that announced him as a serious player, yet his 15-point range between best and worst rounds (49 to 34) revealed a volatility that made Alex Baker's late challenge credible. That Baker briefly held the lead with four holes to play speaks to both his tenacity and Patterson's vulnerability under pressure.

Mullin's eighth Green Jacket, meanwhile, was a monument to consistency betrayed by a single moment—the opening quad bogey of Round 4 that served as a reminder that even champions are mortal. His wire-to-wire Gross lead (save that disastrous first hole) and ten-stroke victory margin underscore how utterly he controlled the absolute scoring, even as his Stableford returns (third place, 20 points behind Patterson) illustrated the leveling power of handicaps.

The tournament's eleven total birdies—the fewest in TEG history through this point—suggest a coastal assault that demanded respect rather than fireworks. Yet within those constraints, drama flourished: Jon Baker's Round 1 brilliance fading into irrelevance, Williams and Neumann scrapping for sixth place dignity, and Stuart Neumann claiming his third Wooden Spoon despite improved late-round play. Patterson led for 53 of 72 holes, but it was Baker's four-hole reign in Round 4 that provided the tournament's emotional crescendo—proof that in match play's unpredictable theatre, no lead is ever truly safe until the final putt drops.
