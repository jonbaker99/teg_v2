John Patterson seized the Trophy in his tournament debut with a 49-point Round 2 explosion that set up a commanding victory. His wire-to-wire dominance featured 53 holes at the summit and a six-point margin over Alex Baker. David Mullin claimed his eighth Green Jacket with ruthless consistency, leading 62 of 72 holes and winning by ten strokes in gross scoring.

The bifurcated crown told contrasting stories. Patterson's Stableford brilliance centred on that second-round masterclass, featuring three birdies and thirty points across the back nine at Praia D'El Rey. Mullin's gross scoring machine never faltered, posting rounds between +16 and +22 whilst others struggled with Royal Óbidos and Praia D'El Rey's dual challenges.

Alex Baker's tournament became defined by a cruel final-round sequence. His 44-point surge briefly delivered the Trophy lead at the 14th hole before consecutive blow-ups at the 15th and 16th extinguished his challenge. Jon Baker claimed third in the Trophy race despite surrendering the opening-round lead with a first-hole implosion in Round 2.

## Round 1: Baker's Brief Ascendancy {#round-1}

Jon Baker opened with 39 points at Royal Óbidos to claim the Trophy lead by a single point. His level par 17-stroke gross round also held the Jacket summit until drama at the final hole.

The 18th delivered the day's defining moment. Baker's quintuple bogey handed the Jacket lead to David Mullin, who pounced with a level-par finish to forge ahead by two strokes. John Patterson matched Baker's 38 points despite a sextuple bogey at the 4th, salvaging his round with a birdie at the 17th and four points at the 5th.

Alex Baker's opening descent began immediately. Consecutive blow-ups at the 1st and 2nd cost nine points before a catastrophic 11 at the 14th left him 32 points back. Stuart Neumann's 23-point struggle featured three zero-point holes, including disasters at the 11th, 12th and 15th. Gregg Williams posted 31 points but surrendered ground with a quintuple at the opening hole and blow-ups at the 15th and 18th.

## Round 2: Patterson's 49-Point Detonation {#round-2}

John Patterson's 49-point explosion at Praia D'El Rey announced his arrival with devastating force. The tournament's finest Stableford round seized both Trophy and Jacket leads, establishing a ten-point cushion in the primary competition.

Jon Baker surrendered the Trophy summit at the opening hole, his triple bogey handing Patterson a lead he would never relinquish. Patterson's back-nine assault produced thirty points, anchored by birdies at the 7th, 12th and 17th. He regained the Trophy lead at the 11th after David Mullin briefly threatened, then detonated across the closing stretch with eleven points from the final three holes.

Mullin's 39-point round couldn't match Patterson's surge but maintained Jacket control. His birdie at the 10th briefly lifted him to the Trophy summit before Patterson's 12th-hole birdie reclaimed it. Alex Baker posted 44 points to move into second place, whilst Gregg Williams' day collapsed at the 9th with a sextuple bogey. Stuart Neumann registered just thirty points after blow-ups at the 9th, 11th, 12th and 13th, all yielding zero.

## Round 3: Lead Wobbles but Holds {#round-3}

John Patterson's 34-point struggle at Royal Óbidos narrowed his Trophy advantage to three points as Alex Baker surged with the round's best Stableford performance. David Mullin extended his Jacket dominance despite stumbling.

Patterson's opening-hole wobbles set the tone. A triple at the 3rd cost him zero points, immediately followed by another blow-up at the 4th. His lead evaporated to nothing before recovering through the middle stretch, though a disaster at the 12th threatened complete collapse. He limped home with 34 points, his worst round yet.

Alex Baker's 42-point charge came via a spectacular front nine of 24 points. He avoided serious damage until the 14th, where a quintuple haemorrhaged crucial ground. Jon Baker's 34 points featured a birdie at the 2nd but blow-ups at the 7th and 11th prevented any Trophy challenge. His +22 gross round matched Mullin's, though the Jacket leader's 33 Stableford points underscored his struggles.

Gregg Williams posted 38 points to climb the rankings whilst Stuart Neumann matched that total despite disasters at the 4th and 16th. The Trophy race had tightened dramatically heading into the finale.

**Round 3 Standings:**  
**Trophy:** JP 121 | AB 118 | DM 110 | JB 110 | GW 105 | SN 90

## Round 4: Patterson Extends, Baker Heartbreak {#round-4}

John Patterson's 47-point finale at Praia D'El Rey sealed his debut Trophy triumph by six points after Alex Baker's late challenge crumbled spectacularly. David Mullin secured his eighth Jacket with a 38-point round that emphasised his gross scoring mastery.

Patterson absorbed an early blow at the 5th, his quintuple bogey yielding zero points, but recovered immediately with four points at the 6th. His birdie at the 12th steadied the ship as Baker launched his assault. The four-point cushion looked vulnerable until Baker's wheels fell off.

Alex Baker's 44-point surge created the round's defining drama. His birdie at the 8th ignited hope, followed by another at the 13th that vaulted him into the Trophy lead at the 14th hole. Dreams turned to ashes immediately. A blow-up at the 15th for zero points, followed by a triple at the 16th, killed his challenge. He finished six points adrift.

Gregg Williams endured a catastrophic undecimo at the 7th, the tournament's worst single-hole score. Jon Baker posted 36 points but a quintuple at the 17th ensured fourth place. Stuart Neumann's birdie at the 13th provided brief respite before a disaster at the 16th. His 37-point round secured the Wooden Spoon by 41 points.

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

John Patterson's debut Trophy triumph arrived via the most explosive single round in tournament history. His 49-point Round 2 masterclass at Praia D'El Rey created a ten-point cushion that withstood Alex Baker's desperate final-round assault. Leading 53 of 72 holes, Patterson demonstrated remarkable composure for a tournament newcomer, absorbing Round 3's wobble to extend his advantage in the finale.

David Mullin's eighth Green Jacket emphasised gross scoring dominance. Leading 62 holes from the front, his consistency across all four rounds proved untouchable. The ten-stroke margin over Jon Baker understated his control, with rounds between +16 and +22 showcasing relentless reliability whilst others fluctuated wildly.

The tournament's cruel moment arrived at the 15th hole in Round 4. Alex Baker had seized the Trophy lead one hole earlier, only to blow up for zero points and hand it straight back. His consecutive disasters at the 15th and 16th cost him twelve strokes against par and six crucial Stableford points. The six-point final margin reflected that collapse rather than Patterson's superiority.

Ten birdies across the tournament underscored scoring difficulty. Patterson claimed four, including his Round 2 hat-trick that sealed victory. Jon Baker's three birdies couldn't overcome his inconsistency, whilst Mullin's two anchored his Jacket charge. Stuart Neumann's Wooden Spoon owed much to seventeen zero-point holes across four rounds, his single birdie at the final-round 13th providing scant consolation.

The bifurcated crown split between Patterson's Stableford brilliance and Mullin's gross mastery. Only once did they overlap, at Round 2's conclusion, before diverging into separate battles. Patterson's three-birdie surge defined his Trophy triumph. Mullin's metronomic consistency defined his Jacket dominance. Different paths, different champions.
