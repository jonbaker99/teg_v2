# TEG 12: The Great Divergence

For the first time in five tournaments, the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket went their separate ways. John Patterson claimed his second Trophy with a commanding 10-point Stableford victory, grinding out 172 points with metronomic precision across four rounds in Catalonia. Meanwhile, Jon Baker secured his second Green Jacket with an 8-stroke gross triumph, leading wire-to-wire for 72 holes while finishing a distant fourth in the Stableford standings. Split outcomes are rare in this format—the handicap usually aligns merit across both competitions—but TEG 12 delivered a fascinating paradox: gross dominance without Stableford glory, and Stableford mastery built on relentless consistency rather than low scoring.

The defining moment came in Round 3 on the Stadium course. Gregg Williams, who'd led the Stableford through 36 holes, imploded spectacularly with disasters on the 12th (triple bogey) and 13th (septuple bogey or worse) that yielded just one point from two holes. Patterson pounced with 45 points to seize an eight-point lead he'd never relinquish. Williams rallied to finish second, 10 points back, but Round 3's seismic shift sealed his fate. Patterson's victory was built on robotic reliability—a narrow 40-45-42-45 range that produced the lowest gross variance ever recorded (standard deviation 0.82, scores of 23-25)—while Baker's gross campaign was a model of wire-to-wire authority, never trailing despite accumulating just 145 Stableford points.

The tournament's tragic figure was David Mullin, whose runner-up gross finish (+71, second only to Baker's +63) couldn't prevent him earning his third Wooden Spoon. Last in Stableford with 139 points, Mullin epitomized the cruelty of the handicap system: gross quality punished by net scoring. His Round 4 meltdown—disasters on holes 3, 4, and 10—buried any Stableford hopes, even as birdies on 12 and 14 showed flashes of brilliance. Stuart Neumann provided the tournament's only eagle, a five-pointer on the 15th in Round 4, but finished third at 155 points. Alex Baker's campaign never recovered from a disastrous opening stretch—disasters on holes 1, 2, 10, 13, and 15—that left him 15 points adrift by day's end.

## Round 1: Early Chaos on the Tour Course

The field returned to PGA Catalunya's Tour course for the second consecutive TEG, but familiarity bred no comfort. The opening stretch turned into a disaster zone. Patterson took the early Stableford and gross leads at the 1st, only to hemorrhage it immediately with a triple bogey disaster on the 2nd. Alex Baker's start was even uglier—disasters on holes 1 and 2, followed by a quintuple bogey catastrophe on the 10th that briefly dropped him to the bottom of the Spoon standings. Jon Baker opened with his own disaster, a triple bogey on the 1st, before recovering with birdies on the 3rd and 14th to share the gross lead at +12 with Williams.

The lead changed hands constantly. Williams, David Mullin, and Stuart Neumann shared the Stableford summit after the 2nd, but Patterson's four-pointer on the 3rd restored his advantage. Then came the 4th hole—a carnage parade featuring Patterson's eight-over quintuple bogey disaster, Mullin's triple, and Neumann's triple. Williams emerged from the wreckage with the gross lead, though Patterson battled back with four-pointers on holes 8, 9, 10, and 11 to retake the Stableford lead temporarily. Neumann endured the round's worst stretch—disasters on holes 5 (quintuple), 13 (sextuple), and 15 (septuple)—yet somehow stayed fourth at 36 points.

By day's end, Williams held a precarious one-point Stableford lead over Patterson (46-45) while sharing the gross lead with Jon Baker at +12. Alex Baker sat last at 34 points after five disasters. The stage was set, but nobody could hold a lead for more than a few holes.

**Round 1 scores:** GW 46pts/+12, JP 45pts/+24, JB 40pts/+12, SN 36pts/+33, DM 35pts/+17, AB 34pts/+30

## Round 2: Williams Holds the Line

Williams extended his Stableford lead to 88 points through 36 holes, maintaining a one-point cushion over Patterson (87) despite the latter's 42-point round briefly threatening the summit mid-round. The story was Williams's resilience: after a disaster on the 4th cost him the gross lead, he answered with a birdie on the 10th to reclaim it, then survived Patterson's quintuple bogey collapse on the 15th to close the round with another gross lead change on the 18th, winning both competitions after two days.

Mullin delivered the tournament's best gross round—84 strokes, matching Williams's Round 1 course record—with flawless par golf from holes 5-8. But it was Neumann's 44-point Stableford explosion that stole headlines. His run from holes 4-9 (19 points including a birdie on the 6th) and continuation through holes 6-13 (another 19-point spell) vaulted him to third overall at 80 points, 8 back of Williams. Jon Baker's birdie on the 11th helped him stay within 12 points of the Stableford lead, though he trailed Williams and Mullin in gross.

Alex Baker finally found form on the back nine—23 points after just 14 on the front—highlighted by a birdie on the 10th that anchored an 18-point spell from holes 10-15. His 37-point round moved him off the Spoon bottom. Patterson's consistency (42 points) kept him second, but Williams's two-round command suggested the Trophy might be decided early.

**Round 2 scores:** GW 42pts/+16, JP 42pts/+24, SN 44pts/+21, JB 36pts/+16, AB 37pts/+24, DM 40pts/+12  
**Through 36 holes:** GW 88pts/+28, JP 87pts/+48, SN 80pts/+54, JB 76pts/+28, DM 75pts/+29, AB 71pts/+54

## Round 3: Patterson's Earthquake and Williams's Collapse

The Stadium course delivered the tournament's seismic shift. Patterson's 45-point masterclass—the round's best—gave him a commanding eight-point lead entering Sunday, while Williams's 36-point implosion dropped him to second. The key moments came in rapid succession. Patterson took the Stableford lead on the 1st, lost it after a quintuple bogey disaster on the 3rd, then reclaimed it when Williams suffered his own quintuple on the 4th. Jon Baker seized the gross lead on the same hole with a birdie on the 12th sealing his authority.

The defining stretch was Williams's back-nine nightmare. His disaster on the 12th (triple bogey) was merely a prelude to the 13th's septuple bogey catastrophe—a seven-over explosion that yielded zero points. The two-hole window (11-13) produced just one point, destroying Williams's Stableford lead for good. Patterson, meanwhile, surged from holes 12-17 with 19 points including a birdie on the 15th, opening a gap that would prove insurmountable. Williams's 36-point round represented a 10-point collapse from his 46-42 opening, the precise margin that would decide the Trophy.

Elsewhere, the round was brutal. Alex Baker's disasters on holes 2 and 4 yielded one point from that stretch. Mullin's disaster on the 2nd and Neumann's quadruple on the 15th added to the carnage. But Patterson's consistency—45 points built on steady accumulation rather than gross excellence (23 strokes, fourth-best)—established him as the metronomic champion. Baker's gross round of 18 (89 strokes) set a new Stadium course record, cementing his wire-to-wire gross dominance even as his Stableford rank (fourth with 34 points) confirmed the divergence.

**Round 3 scores:** JP 45pts/+23, GW 36pts/+28, SN 35pts/+30, JB 34pts/+18, AB 32pts/+29, DM 30pts/+22  
**Through 54 holes:** JP 132pts/+71, GW 124pts/+56, SN 115pts/+84, JB 110pts/+46, AB 103pts/+83, DM 105pts/+51

## Round 4: Patterson's Coronation, Mullin's Spoon

Patterson closed with 40 points to seal a 10-point Trophy victory, his 172-point total built on a five-point range (40-45) that represented the most consistent four-round performance in TEG history. His Round 4 stumble—a triple bogey on the 1st dropped him to +3 early—mattered not at all. Williams answered with 38 points and a birdie on the 7th, but never threatened Patterson's lead. The margin stayed at 10, Patterson claiming his second Trophy after TEG 9's triumph.

Jon Baker's 35-point round and gross score of 17 (+89, tying his Round 3 Stadium record) secured the Green Jacket by eight strokes over Mullin, completing a wire-to-wire gross campaign that never saw him trail. His birdie on the 8th epitomized his steady excellence. Yet he ranked fourth in Stableford—145 points, 27 behind Patterson—a stunning divergence that ended four consecutive TEGs where Trophy and Jacket went to the same player.

Mullin's tragic finale encapsulated his week. Disasters on holes 3 (quadruple), 4 (quadruple), and 10 (triple) yielded zero points from three holes, sealing his third Wooden Spoon with 139 points despite his +71 gross total (second only to Baker's +63). His back-nine rally—birdies on 12 and 14 producing an 11-point spell from holes 12-14—came too late. Neumann matched Patterson's 40 points, highlighted by the tournament's only eagle (five points on the 15th), but finished third at 155. Alex Baker's 40-point round moved him to fifth at 143, clear of the Spoon by four points.

**Final scores:** JP 172pts/+96, GW 162pts/+76, SN 155pts/+108, JB 145pts/+63, AB 143pts/+104, DM 139pts/+71

## Tournament Recap: Two Crowns, Two Kings

TEG 12 will be remembered as the tournament of parallel universes. Patterson's Trophy campaign was a testament to robotic consistency—four rounds within a five-point band, the lowest gross variance ever recorded, zero heroics but zero disasters when they mattered. His Round 3 surge (45 points) coincided perfectly with Williams's collapse, and his metronomic accumulation left no doubt. Williams fought valiantly, finishing second for the second time in his career, but the 12th and 13th holes of Round 3 will haunt him—10 points surrendered in the space that decided the Trophy.

Baker's Green Jacket triumph was equally emphatic: 72 holes in the lead, an eight-stroke margin, back-to-back Stadium course records (89 strokes in Rounds 3 and 4). Yet his fourth-place Stableford finish—27 points behind Patterson—proved that gross excellence doesn't guarantee handicap success. The Great Divergence was complete: for the first time since TEG 7, the Trophy and Jacket parted ways, a reminder that consistency beats brilliance in Stableford, while gross scoring remains the purest meritocracy.

Mullin's runner-up gross finish earning the Wooden Spoon was poetry of the cruelest kind—brilliance punished, a paradox worthy of Sisyphus. Neumann's eagle on the 15th provided the tournament's lone five-pointer. Alex Baker survived five first-round disasters to climb clear of the Spoon. But this was Patterson and Baker's stage, wire-to-wire on two different tracks, two champions crowned under the Catalonian sun, each master of his domain.
