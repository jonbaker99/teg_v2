# TEG 5 - Player Profiles

---

## Jon BAKER - 1st (Net vs Par: 156 pts) | 2nd (Gross: 98 strokes, +6)

Jon Baker arrived at TEG 5 and did what Jon does best: led from start to finish with all the drama of someone completing a spreadsheet. His second TEG Trophy, his second wire-to-wire victory, his second demonstration that boring beats everything.

**The Dominance:** Led every round. Forty-five, 38, 38, 35. That's not excitement; that's a flat line with a gradual decline. Won by 11 points over Gregg. Never threatened. Never faltered. Never interesting.

**The Net vs Par Format:** This was the last tournament using net vs par scoring before the switch to Stableford. Jon mastered it one final time, then presumably forgot it existed.

## David MULLIN - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Net vs Par: 136 pts, +20) | 1st (Gross: 92 strokes, **Green Jacket**, +6 clear)

David Mullin achieved something truly special at TEG 5: he simultaneously won the Green Jacket AND collected the wooden spoon. Same golf. Same weekend. Champion AND disaster. Golf's most absurd outcome.

**The Green Jacket:** Fourth consecutive. Ninety-two gross strokes, 6 clear of second. Dominant. Professional. Classic David grinding excellence.

**The Wooden Spoon:** Last place in net vs par with 136 points. LAST. The same rounds that delivered gross dominance left him trailing badly in net scoring. The net format looked at David's high handicap and said "not today, champion."

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd (Net vs Par: 145 pts, +11) | 5th (Gross: 127 strokes, +35)

Gregg Williams achieved his career-best TEG finish with second place and 145 points, proving that sometimes not being terrible counts as success.

**The Performance:** 41-36-35-37. Decent. Solid. The kind of golf that earns respect without inspiring anyone. Gregg improved from his usual disasters to merely mediocre, and somehow that was enough for silver.

**The Margin:** Lost to Jon by 11 points. Never really threatened. Spent the week playing for second while Jon occupied first. Mission accomplished, I suppose.

## Henry MELLER - 3rd= (Net vs Par: 139 pts, +17) | 4th (Gross: 98 strokes, +6)

Henry Meller finished third with 139 points through the simple strategy of being present and occasionally competent.

**The Rounds:** 35-32-36-34. That's not consistency; that's a random number generator stuck in the mid-30s. Henry played golf like someone who'd set an alarm for "mediocre" and hit snooze.

**The Birdies:** Four across the tournament. More than anyone else. Did it matter? Did it change anything? No and no. Henry collected birdies like participation trophiesâ€”nice to have, ultimately meaningless.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 3rd= (Net vs Par: 139 pts, +17) | 3rd (Gross: 99 strokes, +7)

Stuart Neumann tied for third with 139 points by doing what Stuartdoes best: existing without causing a fuss.

**The Rounds:** 30-34-33-38. That's not a trajectory; that's golf by random selection. Stu's final round 38 was his best, which is like bringing your A-game after the party's over. Timing, Stuart. Timing.

**The Tie:** One hundred thirty-nine points, same as Henry. Except Henry had four birdies and Stuarthad one. Henry attacked; Stuartsurvived. They tied. Golf makes no sense.
