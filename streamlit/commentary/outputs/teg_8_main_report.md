# TEG 8: Williams Claims Wire-to-Wire Trophy as Mullin Secures Seventh Green Jacket

Gregg Williams emerged from the Lisbon Coast sunshine with his second TEG Trophy, constructing a masterclass in Stableford consistency across four Portuguese layouts that saw him lead for 63 of 72 holes. His 149-point total delivered a commanding 12-point victory margin, punctuated by twin 41-point explosions in Rounds 2 and 4 that turned competition into coronation. Yet this was no simple dominance narrative - David Mullin simultaneously carved his own path to glory, claiming a seventh Green Jacket with a six-stroke gross victory that tied him for the most all-time. The rare spectacle of two separate champions controlling their respective competitions wire-to-wire provided TEG 8 with a dual-monarchy storyline: Williams reigning over the handicapped kingdom while Mullin ruled the gross realm with ruthless efficiency.

Behind the dual champions, Alex Baker authored the tournament's most dramatic arc. Starting Round 4 in distant third place, 13 points adrift, Baker unleashed a stunning 39-point final round that vaulted him into second place overall - a four-spot leap that showcased the volatile beauty of Stableford scoring. His surge provided the tournament's most electrifying subplot, even as Williams cruised serenely toward his coronation. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Stuart Neumann collected his second career Wooden Spoon with a performance that will echo through TEG folklore: 23 disasters across 72 holes, 100 Stableford points total, and finishes of dead last in both competitions. It was the kind of comprehensive struggle that makes champagne taste sweeter at the top.

The venue itself provided fresh drama. Four new courses across consecutive days - Quinta da Marinha twice, Penha Longa, and Oitavos Dunes - tested adaptability and resilience. Williams proved equally comfortable on each layout, his wire-to-wire control never seriously threatened despite a wobbly Round 3. Mullin, meanwhile, led the gross competition from the moment Jon Baker's Round 1 quintuple bogey on the 13th surrendered early control, and never looked back. The Portuguese coast had delivered a tournament of contrasts: dominance and desperation, breakthrough surges and comprehensive collapses, all unfolding beneath the Iberian sun.

## Round 1: Williams Seizes Control as Baker Brothers Implode

Quinta da Marinha greeted the TEG field with deceptive charm in Round 1, but beneath the coastal beauty lurked danger. Williams arrived at the 10th tee in competitive rhythm, and promptly delivered the tournament's defining early statement: a birdie that earned him five Stableford points and vaulted him into the lead. He would never relinquish it. That single hole crystallized his Round 1 dominance, anchoring a sizzling stretch from holes 8-13 where he accumulated 18 points and established the template for his wire-to-wire conquest. His 38-point opening salvo built a four-point cushion over Jon Baker and set the tone for 72 holes of controlled aggression.

The Baker brothers, however, authored starkly different narratives. Jon opened with promise, threatening to match Williams point-for-point until disaster struck on the 13th - a quintuple bogey that shredded both his scorecard and any notion of challenging for the gross lead. That monstrous eight on a par-three not only handed David Mullin the gross lead (which he would share with Jon after 18 holes at +20), but also provided the tournament's first glimpse of the carnage that would define TEG 8. His recovery birdie on 17 salvaged some dignity with four crucial points, but the damage was done.

Alex Baker's round, meanwhile, descended into genuine horror. After a promising front nine yielded 20 points, the back nine became a graveyard of ambition. Holes 16-18 delivered three consecutive disasters averaging +4 vs par, including a quintuple bogey on the 17th that mirrored his brother's earlier catastrophe. His nightmare stretch from holes 8-13 produced just six points despite containing a solid four-pointer on 11, thanks to disasters on 8, 10, and 12. The pattern was established: Alex could flash brilliance, but consistency remained elusive. His 30 points left him tied for third with Mullin in Stableford, but 11 strokes behind in gross - a personal worst that would take three rounds to overcome.

Stuart Neumann's 17-point opening round entered the TEG record books for all the wrong reasons, tying the all-time worst Stableford score in tournament history. His stretch from holes 9-14 yielded just one point across six holes, featuring disasters on 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 that averaged +3.83 vs par. The 43 gross strokes represented a personal nadir, and with 72 holes still to navigate, the Wooden Spoon was already coming into focus.

**Round 1 Scores:** GW: 38pts/+26; JB: 34pts/+21; AB: 30pts/+41; DM: 30pts/+20; HM: 29pts/+29; SN: 17pts/+43

## Round 2: Williams Breaks Clear as Penha Longa Delivers Carnage

Penha Longa produced the tournament's most destructive round, a masterclass in course carnage that saw Williams extend his Stableford lead to 11 points while Mullin seized sole possession of the gross lead with a stunning 14-over-par round - the best of the day by six strokes. This was dominance of different flavours: Williams constructing an 11-point breakaway with 41 points while Mullin's gross consistency pulled him clear of the chaos consuming his competitors.

Williams' front nine proved devastating. His stretch from holes 2-7 accumulated 18 points, featuring four-pointers on both the 4th and 7th that built an insurmountable advantage. By the turn, his nearest Stableford challenger trailed by seven points, and the gap would only widen. Yet even Williams couldn't entirely escape Penha Longa's teeth - his quintuple bogey (a ten on the par-five 12th) provided the round's most shocking moment, a rare stumble that briefly threatened his rhythm. But the damage was minimal: he'd built enough cushion on the front nine to absorb the disaster, and his 41-point total represented the tournament's finest round to that point.

Mullin, meanwhile, authored a gross masterpiece. His birdie on the 6th - the round's only one in gross terms - anchored a stretch from holes 4-8 that averaged par golf while others haemorrhaged strokes. His 14-over-par round might sound modest, but in conditions that saw Alex Baker card 34 gross and Henry Meller 30, it was positively surgical. From this point forward, Mullin led the gross competition for 63 of the remaining 72 holes - wire-to-wire dominance in everything but name.

The carnage at the par-four 16th will live in TEG infamy. Five players posted zero Stableford points: Henry Meller's quintuple bogey (nine on a par-four), Neumann's matching quintuple, Alex Baker's quadruple, and triple bogeys from Williams and Jon Baker. It was a massacre, the kind of hole that separates tournaments into survivors and casualties. Meller's suffering continued through 17 (another triple bogey) while Neumann closed with disaster on 18, completing a back nine that saw him accumulate just 12 points compared to 19 on the front.

Alex Baker's 36 points kept him competitive in Stableford despite his 34 gross strokes - a 20-over-par performance that illustrated the beauty and cruelty of handicapped golf. His front nine (21 points) suggested a challenge to Williams might materialize, but his back-nine disasters on 16 and 18 (quadruple bogeys both) closed that window emphatically.

**Round 2 Scores:** GW: 79pts/+50; AB: 66pts/+75; DM: 66pts/+34; JB: 68pts/+40; SN: 48pts/+70; HM: 56pts/+59

## Round 3: Williams Wobbles But Holds Firm as Baker Surges

Quinta da Marinha's second appearance tested Williams' mettle, and for the first time across 72 holes, his dominance wavered. A 29-point round - his weakest of the tournament - saw his 11-point lead shrink to five as Alex Baker (32 points) and Jon Baker (35 points) applied pressure. Yet Williams never relinquished the lead, and the gap remained substantial enough to suggest the Trophy's destination was decided. The gross competition, however, provided genuine drama: Jon Baker briefly seized the lead on the 12th hole, only to watch Mullin reclaim it by the 15th and hold it through 18.

Williams' struggles centered on the back nine, where holes 9-11 delivered just one point. His disasters on the 10th (a nine on a par-five) and 11th (a quintuple bogey on another par-five) represented the tournament's only extended period where his control appeared threatened. That he emerged with the lead intact - and extended it back to seven points by Round 4's start - testified to the cushion he'd built in Round 2. His front nine (18 points) kept him ahead of the chaos, but the back nine (11 points) offered his competitors a glimpse of vulnerability they ultimately couldn't exploit.

Alex Baker's 32 points hinted at the explosion to come. His quintuple bogey on the 8th (ten on a par-four) could have derailed his round, but a birdie on 17 steadied the ship and kept him within touching distance of second place overall. More importantly, it previewed the resilience that would define his Round 4 heroics. His 40 gross strokes weren't pretty, but Stableford forgives disasters more readily than gross scoring, and Baker's ability to harvest points elsewhere kept his tournament alive.

Neumann's nightmare continued with mathematical precision: 20 points, 43 gross strokes, and disasters on the 1st (quintuple bogey), 4th (another quintuple), 9th (eight on a par-three), and 10th (eleven on a par-five). His stretch from holes 1-6 yielded just four points, featuring three disasters that averaged +3.00 vs par. With one round remaining, his Wooden Spoon appeared inevitable, his 68 Stableford points through three rounds the tournament's rock-bottom baseline.

Jon Baker's 35-point round secured him the gross lead briefly, his back-nine surge (20 points vs 15 on the front) exemplifying the back-nine-strong pattern that would define several performances. His 18 gross strokes - five better than Meller, 14 better than Williams - briefly placed him atop the gross leaderboard before Mullin's consistency restored natural order. Yet he'd planted seeds of doubt about the Green Jacket's destination, setting up a tense final round that Mullin would ultimately navigate with birdies on 13 and 16.

**Round 3 Scores:** GW: 108pts/+85; AB: 98pts/+115; JB: 103pts/+58; DM: 92pts/+60; HM: 90pts/+83; SN: 68pts/+113

## Round 4: Williams Cruises Home as Baker Delivers Stunning Surge

Oitavos Dunes provided the stage for Williams' coronation and Baker's resurrection. Williams' 41-point final round - matching his Round 2 masterpiece - delivered a 12-point victory margin that transformed "comfortable" into "emphatic." His back-nine explosion (24 points vs 17 on the front) showcased the champion's ability to deliver when stakes were highest, even if those stakes were largely ceremonial by the time he reached the turn.

Yet the round belonged, narratively at least, to Alex Baker. His 39-point eruption - the tournament's second-best round - propelled him from distant third (13 points behind second-placed Jon Baker) to outright second place in a four-spot leap that defied mathematical gravity. This wasn't mere competence; it was brilliance forged from resilience, a player who'd posted personal worsts in Round 1 delivering personal excellence when it mattered most. His 33 gross strokes couldn't compare to Mullin's 17 (the round's best by eight), but Stableford rewards consistency over perfection, and Baker's ability to harvest points across 18 holes proved decisive.

Mullin's victory march in gross terms provided elegant counterpoint to Williams' Stableford dominance. His birdies on 13 and 16 - the round's defining moments in gross competition - sealed his seventh Green Jacket with clinical efficiency. From the moment Jon Baker triple-bogeyed the 2nd hole to hand Mullin the lead, the outcome felt inevitable. His 17 gross strokes (+17 vs par on this brutal layout) represented a six-stroke victory over Jon Baker's 83 total, wire-to-wire control that mirrored Williams' Stableford dominance yet somehow felt more workmanlike, less dramatic.

Henry Meller's final-round implosion completed the tournament's arc of contrasts. His 21-point round - worst of the day - featured a catastrophic stretch from holes 2-5 where he accumulated just three points across four holes. The disasters came in waves: +4 vs par on the 2nd, +6 on the 4th (the round's worst hole), +5 on the 5th. His front nine yielded just eight points, and while his back nine (13 points) represented mild improvement, the damage was comprehensive. That 16-stroke gross performance dropped him to fifth in gross terms and cemented his role in the tournament's cautionary tales.

Neumann's 32-point finale represented his best round of the week - faint praise for a performance that nonetheless secured his Wooden Spoon by 11 points over Meller in Stableford and 14 strokes in gross. His 100-point tournament total and 23 total disasters across 72 holes provided the statistical footnote to a week he'll be keen to forget. Yet there was dignity in completing the journey, in facing down Penha Longa's carnage and Oitavos Dunes' final examination without surrendering entirely.

Jon Baker's fade - 28 points in the final round after leading gross through 54 holes - completed the gross competition's drama. His disasters on 8 and 10 cost him dearly, and by the time Mullin birdied 13, the Green Jacket had changed hands permanently. His 131 Stableford points secured fourth place overall, but the gross runner-up position offered cold comfort after leading for 15 holes across the tournament.

**Final Scores:** GW: 149pts/+107; AB: 137pts/+148; JB: 131pts/+83; DM: 126pts/+77; HM: 111pts/+123; SN: 100pts/+137

## Tournament Recap: Dual Dominance and Dramatic Surges on the Portuguese Coast

TEG 8 will be remembered as the tournament of split narratives: Gregg Williams controlling Stableford with wire-to-wire authority while David Mullin simultaneously commanded gross scoring with ruthless consistency. That both men led their respective competitions for 63 of 72 holes provided a rare symmetry, twin monarchs ruling separate kingdoms on the same Portuguese terrain. Williams' 149-point total and 12-point victory margin spoke to Stableford mastery - the ability to harvest points even when disasters struck (that quintuple bogey on Penha Longa's 12th), to build breakaway leads in Rounds 2 and 4, to never trail across four days of competition. Mullin's seventh Green Jacket, meanwhile, tied him for most all-time while showcasing the gross consistency that separates champions from contenders: four birdies across 72 holes, six-stroke victory margin, and the kind of steady excellence that makes dominance look effortless.

Yet Alex Baker's final-round heroics added the narrative spice that pure dominance sometimes lacks. His 39-point explosion on Oitavos Dunes - vaulting from distant third to second place in a single round - proved that TEG tournaments remain volatile until the final putt drops. That he achieved this surge despite opening with a personal-worst 41 gross strokes in Round 1 only amplified the drama. This was resilience rewarded, a player refusing to accept early disasters as destiny and delivering when it mattered most.

At the other extreme, Stuart Neumann's Wooden Spoon collection provided cautionary context. Twenty-three disasters across 72 holes. One hundred Stableford points. Dead last in both competitions. The numbers tell their own story, but there's something almost admirably comprehensive about such struggles - no false hope, no teasing near-misses, just consistent rock-bottom performance that secured his second career Wooden Spoon by margins (11 points, 14 strokes) as emphatic as Williams' Trophy victory. The Portuguese coast had delivered sunshine and carnage in equal measure, four new courses testing adaptability across consecutive days, and at the end of it all, two champions reigning supreme while others chased glory or fled disaster. TEG 8: where dominance came in duplicate, and the gap between triumph and catastrophe proved as wide as the Atlantic horizon.
