# TEG 8 Tournament Report

Welcome to TEG 8 at Quinta da Marinha, where two historic events occurred: the tournament finally switched to true Stableford scoring, and Gregg Williams discovered that winning while wobbling is still winning. One hundred forty-nine Stableford points. Wire-to-wire victory. A Round 3 wobble that nearly surrendered everything. A Round 4 recovery that sealed his second TEG Trophy. Golf makes perfect sense when you're Gregg Williams and you remember to win when it matters.

This was Gregg's second TEG Trophy, three years after his first, achieved with rounds of 38-41-29-41 that told the story of dominance, more dominance, sudden panic, and redemptive brilliance. Alex Baker finished second with 137 points, redemption for last year's wooden spoon debut. Dave Mullin finished fourth in Stableford and collected his seventh consecutive Green Jacket because the streak doesn't care about your Stableford position.

## Welcome to Stableford

TEG 8 marked the official switch from net vs par to pure Stableford scoring. The format that would define TEG golf for the next decade arrived at Quinta da Marinha, and Gregg Williams immediately approved by winning wire-to-wire.

Stableford rewards consistency and punishes disasters differently than net vs par. Gregg discovered both truths across four rounds: consistency in Rounds 1, 2, and 4 (38-41-41). Disaster narrowly avoided in Round 3 (29 points while Jon and Alex posted 35 each).

## The Wobble

After two dominant rounds (38-41) that built a 9-point cushion, Gregg arrived at Round 3 and proceeded to forget how to golf. Twenty-nine Stableford points. Jon and Alex both posted 35. The lead shrank from 9 to 1. One point. Gregg had used two rounds to build dominance and one round to nearly surrender it all.

Then came Round 4, where Gregg remembered he was supposed to be winning and posted 41 points—joint-best round of the tournament—to win by 12. Crisis averted. Trophy secured. Heart rate: eventually normal.

## Alex's Redemption Arc

Alex Baker finished second with 137 points, twelve months after debuting with the wooden spoon. From last to second in one year. The redemption arc complete. Alex proved that wooden spoons aren't destiny; they're merely embarrassing starting points for better things.

His rounds (33-34-35-29) showed gradual improvement through three rounds before a final-round 29 that suggested Alex had learned the Gregg Williams strategy of wobbling at inconvenient moments. Still, second place and 12 points clear of third-placed Jon was a comprehensive improvement on last year's disaster.

## Dave's Seventh Jacket From Fourth

David Mullin finished fourth in Stableford with 126 points, 23 behind Gregg's total. Seventh consecutive Green Jacket from fourth place in the actual competition. The Dave Mullin paradox had become routine. Fourth in Stableford, first in Green Jackets. Different game, same Dave, same streak.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Gregg 38 (leads), Dave 36, Jon 34, Alex 33, Henry 29, Stu 27

**Round 2:** Gregg 41 (extends to +9), Dave 36, Alex 34, Jon 33, Henry 28, Stu 26

**Round 3:** Gregg 29 (WOBBLE! Lead to +1), Jon/Alex 35, Henry 31, Dave 28, Stu 23

**Round 4:** Gregg 41 (seals it, wins by 12!), Jon/Alex 29, Dave 26, Stu 24, Henry 23

## The Verdict

Gregg Williams' second TEG Trophy was earned through dominance, wobble, and recovery. Welcome to Stableford, Gregg approves. Alex Baker's redemption from wooden spoon to silver was complete. Jon's bronze (131) was professional but forgettable. Dave's seventh consecutive Green Jacket from fourth in Stableford was vintage Dave. Henry's fifth (111) and Stu's wooden spoon (100 points—yes, really, 100) rounded out the field.

Quinta da Marinha witnessed its first TEG. Stableford scoring made its proper debut. And Gregg proved that wobbling in Round 3 doesn't matter if you remember to dominate in Round 4. Second Trophy secured. The Gregg Williams era continues.
