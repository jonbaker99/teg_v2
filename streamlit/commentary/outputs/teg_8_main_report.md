Gregg Williams secured his second Trophy with a commanding wire-to-wire performance across Portugal's Lisbon Coast, leading 63 of 72 holes to finish 12 points clear. David Mullin claimed his seventh Green Jacket in eight tournaments, seizing the Gross lead on Day One and never relinquishing it despite finishing 23 points behind Williams in Stableford.

The split championship crowned different victors in each format for the first time in three tournaments. Williams dominated the points battle with ruthless consistency. Mullin controlled the stroke-play competition whilst finishing fourth in Trophy standings. Their paths rarely intersected.

Alex Baker climbed to second place in the Trophy with a 39-point final round, overcoming 13 zero-point disasters and the field's worst gross score. Stuart Neumann collected his second Wooden Spoon, registering 23 scoreless holes across four days. Jon Baker mounted the tournament's only serious challenge, trading the Jacket lead five times with Mullin across the final two rounds before surrendering on Sunday.

## Round 1: Williams Seizes Control at Quinta da Marinha {#round-1}

Quinta da Marinha's pine-forested parkland offered spectacular ocean views and abundant Robert Trent Jones Sr. bunkering. Williams held a slender four-point advantage entering the back nine. Alex Baker led the Trophy through nine holes. Everything changed at the Par 5 tenth.

Williams rolled in a birdie for five points, simultaneously seizing the lead. Alex Baker imploded to a nine, registering his second zero of the day. He would record three more blobs before sunset, including a catastrophic nine at the 17th. His front-nine promise—20 points—evaporated into a 10-point back nine collapse.

Jon Baker's challenge faltered at the 13th, where a nine cost him the Jacket lead he'd briefly held. David Mullin's opening birdie at the second signalled his intent in Gross competition. He posted +20 to lead by one stroke despite a forgettable seven at the third. Neumann's nightmare began immediately—an eight at the first dropped him to last place, where he would remain for 72 holes. His 17-point round equalled the worst Stableford score in tournament history.

Williams closed with 38 points and +26 gross, establishing control in both competitions. Mullin held the Jacket lead. The gap between them: six strokes in Gross, eight points in Stableford.

**Stableford:** GW 38 | JB 34 | AB 30 | DM 30 | HM 29 | SN 17  
**Gross:** DM +20 | JB +21 | GW +26 | HM +29 | AB +41 | SN +43

## Round 2: Williams Extends Lead Despite Quintuple Disaster {#round-2}

Penha Longa's dramatic mountain terrain and steep elevation changes tested nerve and club selection. Williams opened brilliantly, collecting level-par scores and four-point returns on the fourth, seventh and tenth. Through 11 holes he'd built a commanding lead in both competitions. Then came the 12th.

A quintuple bogey ten at the Par 5 erased his Gross momentum but remarkably failed to dent his Stableford advantage. Williams posted 41 points despite the catastrophe, extending his Trophy lead to 11. His resilience would become the week's defining characteristic.

Mullin seized the Jacket lead with a birdie at the sixth, one of only four he would make all week. His +14 round featured the tournament's best Gross score to date. Jon Baker remained within touching distance at +19. Alex Baker posted 36 points but his +34 gross included yet another finishing disaster—a nine at the 18th for zero points.

Henry Meller's round disintegrated across six holes from the 11th. Blow-ups at the 12th, 13th and 16th yielded just four points from six holes. He finished with 27 points and four zeros. Neumann recorded blow-ups at the seventh, tenth and 12th, his 31-point round offering brief respite from complete disaster.

Williams led the Trophy by 11 points. Mullin commanded the Jacket by 24 strokes—a margin that belied the battle to come.

**Stableford:** GW 79 | JB 68 | AB 66 | DM 66 | HM 56 | SN 48  
**Gross:** DM +34 | JB +40 | GW +50 | HM +59 | SN +70 | AB +75

## Round 3: Baker Claims Jacket Lead as Williams Survives Twin Disasters {#round-3}

Quinta da Marinha's return engagement produced carnage across the field. Williams arrived holding substantial leads in both competitions. His dominance in Gross proved illusory. Twin disasters at the tenth and 11th—a nine and a ten yielding one solitary point—cost him any realistic Jacket ambition. He posted 29 points, his grip on the Trophy loosening to five points.

Jon Baker's back-nine surge powered him past Mullin for the Jacket lead. The changeover occurred at the 12th, where both he and Mullin registered eights. Baker's 20-point back nine contrasted sharply with his 15-point front nine struggles. He closed with 35 points and +18 gross, finally holding the Jacket lead.

Mullin's round featured four zeros and just 26 points—his worst Stableford performance in tournament history. The damage concentrated between holes seven and 12, where blow-ups at the seventh, tenth and 12th yielded six points from six holes. He lost the Jacket lead at the 12th, briefly reclaimed it at the 15th, then surrendered it for good at the 17th.

Alex Baker continued his pattern of catastrophic errors punctuated by isolated brilliance. A ten at the eighth—the tournament's worst single-hole score—contributed to his sixth zero-point hole. His birdie at the 17th for five points provided fleeting redemption. Neumann's six-hole opening stretch produced four points, including a ten at the first and nine at the fourth. His sextuple bogey at the tenth equalled the tournament's worst score.

Williams maintained his Trophy lead. Jon Baker claimed the Jacket. Sunday would settle both.

**Stableford:** GW 108 | JB 103 | AB 98 | DM 92 | HM 90 | SN 68  
**Gross:** JB +58 | DM +60 | GW +85 | HM +83 | SN +113 | AB +115

## Round 4: Williams Cruises as Mullin's Course Record Secures Jacket {#round-4}

Oitavos Dunes—Portugal's premier links and the nation's top-ranked course—provided a suitably dramatic stage for the final act. Williams required only competent golf to secure the Trophy. Jon Baker needed perfection to retain the Jacket. Neither man would achieve their objective through excellence alone.

Baker's challenge evaporated at the second hole, where a seven yielded zero points. Mullin immediately reclaimed the Jacket lead with a five for one point. The deficit: one stroke. Baker never recovered, adding another zero at the eighth. His 28-point round left him runner-up in both competitions, six strokes behind in Gross, 18 points adrift in Stableford.

Mullin constructed an 88-stroke masterpiece—the best Gross round in tournament history. Birdies at the 13th and 16th cemented his control. A closing seven at the 18th—his second zero of the day—couldn't diminish the achievement. His 34-point round secured the Jacket by six strokes whilst finishing 23 points behind Williams in Stableford.

Williams posted 41 points despite an eight at the fifth, extending his final margin to 12 points. His seven-point back nine surge contrasted with a front-nine wobble. He led 63 of 72 holes in Stableford, never trailing once. The Trophy was his from the opening nine holes at Quinta da Marinha.

Alex Baker produced the tournament's most schizophrenic performance. Four-point returns on the third, tenth and 12th holes propelled him toward second place. Then catastrophe struck twice in three holes—a seven at the 15th, a nine at the 18th. He finished with 39 points and +33 gross, climbing to second in the Trophy despite recording the field's worst Gross score.

Henry Meller's opening six holes produced carnage: blow-ups at the second, third, fourth and fifth yielded two points. His ten at the fourth—matching the tournament's worst—exemplified the stretch. He recovered for 13 points across the back nine but finished with 21 points overall. Neumann's 32-point round offered dignity if not redemption, his birdie at the first providing rare joy.

**Final Stableford:** GW 149 | AB 137 | JB 131 | DM 126 | HM 111 | SN 100  
**Final Gross:** DM +77 | JB +83 | GW +107 | HM +123 | SN +137 | AB +148

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Gregg Williams claimed his second Trophy through the most commanding wire-to-wire performance in recent memory. Leading 63 of 72 holes, his 12-point victory margin understated the control he exerted. Catastrophic blow-ups at Penha Longa's 12th (quintuple bogey) and Quinta da Marinha's tenth and 11th (consecutive disasters yielding one point) provided brief drama but never threatened his supremacy. His +107 gross score—30 strokes behind Mullin—revealed the format's split personality. Williams mastered Stableford whilst finishing third in stroke play.

David Mullin secured his seventh Green Jacket in eight tournaments with a record-breaking 88-stroke final round at Oitavos Dunes. His +77 total led the Gross competition wire-to-wire, trading the lead with Jon Baker five times across the final two rounds before Sunday's brilliance sealed it. Yet he finished 23 points behind Williams in Stableford, demonstrating the chasm between formats. His four tournament birdies—double anyone else's tally—couldn't overcome 13 zero-point holes in the points competition.

Jon Baker finished runner-up in both competitions, six strokes behind Mullin in Gross and 18 points adrift of Williams in Stableford. He briefly held the Jacket lead for 15 holes across Rounds 3-4 before succumbing to zeros at the second and eighth on Sunday. Alex Baker's second-place Trophy finish defied logic—137 points accompanied the field's worst +148 gross score. His 13 zero-point disasters included a catastrophic ten at Round 3's eighth hole, yet 39 points on Sunday powered him past Jon Baker.

Stuart Neumann collected his second Wooden Spoon with 100 points, finishing 49 behind Williams. His 23 zero-point holes represented one-third of his tournament. Four separate blow-ups at the tenth hole across four rounds exemplified his struggles. Henry Meller's 111 points secured fifth place despite a disastrous final-round opening: holes one through six yielded two points, including a ten at the fourth.

Williams never trailed. Mullin never surrendered the Jacket. The split championship crowned different victors through contrasting paths to glory.
