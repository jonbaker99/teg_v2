# TEG 13 Story Notes

## Key Points
- Jon BAKER's 4th Trophy & 3rd Green Jacket - wire-to-wire sweep, led 70/72 Stableford holes and all 72 Gross holes
- Won Trophy by 6 pts over G. WILLIAMS (158-152); won Jacket by 18 strokes (+50 vs +68)
- Only player to break par gross in any round (R3: +8); five birdies including dramatic R2 H18 reclaim
- John PATTERSON's wild ride - tournament-best 49pts (R3) despite finishing 3rd Trophy/5th Jacket with 14 blow-ups
- David MULLIN's 4th Wooden Spoon - catastrophic H10 quintuple bogey (9 / +5) in R4 sealed fate

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** JB 39pts leads Trophy by 6; JB +13 leads Jacket by 9
- **Round 2:** GW's 41pts closes gap to 1; JB birdie on H18 reclaims lead on countback after brief losses at H15/H18
- **Round 3:** JP's 49pts (tournament-best) vaults from 5th to 3rd; JB extends Trophy lead to 5pts, maintains Jacket command
- **Round 4:** AB's 44pts strong finish; JB's 39pts seals wire-to-wire sweep in both competitions

## Story Angles
- Wire-to-wire domination in both competitions - led Gross all 72 holes, Stableford 70/72
- Countback thriller in R2 - lead changed hands three times on back nine before JB's H18 birdie reclaim
- PATTERSON's bipolar performance - tournament-best 49pts with eagle, yet most blow-ups (14) and highest standard deviation
- MULLIN's tragic H10 collapse - quintuple bogey in final round handed him 4th career Spoon
- Only sub-par round of tournament - BAKER's R3 +8 gross (44pts) showcased consistency advantage
- Two BAKER/WILLIAMS battles - both competitions saw same top-2 finishers, different margins

- "Wire-to-wire dominance"
- "Countback drama redemption"
- "Eagle to disaster"
- "Quintuple bogey catastrophe"
- "Bipolar brilliance and chaos"
