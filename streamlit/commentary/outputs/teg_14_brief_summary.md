# TEG 14 Brief Summary

David Mullin returned from three consecutive wooden spoons to claim both trophies with wire-to-wire dominance: 154 Stableford points (won by 4 over Gregg Williams' 150) and 58 strokes over par (won by 10). Dave led after every round in both competitions, featuring two 4+ point holes on Hole 18â€”one in Round 2, one in Round 3â€”the same hole on consecutive days.

Jon Baker, winner of the previous three doubles (TEG 11-13), collected his first wooden spoon with 125 points, finishing last by 2 points. The complete role reversalâ€”Dave from three spoons to double champion, Jon from three doubles to wooden spoonâ€”marked one of TEG's most dramatic reversals of fortune.

Dave's 10th Green Jacket (first since TEG 10, 2017) and 3rd TEG Trophy confirmed the dynasty had merely been dormant, not dead.

**Winner (Stableford):** David MULLIN - 154 points
**Green Jacket (Gross):** David MULLIN - 58 strokes over par
**Wooden Spoon:** Jon BAKER - 125 points
