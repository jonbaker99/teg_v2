# TEG 3: Baker's Wire-to-Wire Masterclass as Mullin Claims Gross Glory

Jon Baker secured his first TEG Trophy with a performance of ruthless consistency, leading from the opening hole and never relinquishing his grip across seventy-two holes of competition. His seventeen-point margin of victory—the largest in TEG history to that point—came via rounds of 45, 38, 45, and 36 points, a display of Stableford accumulation that left his rivals floundering in his wake. But while Baker dominated the handicapped competition, David Mullin authored his own narrative, claiming a second Green Jacket with a twelve-stroke gross victory that showcased a different kind of excellence entirely. The split champions told the story of a tournament where consistency in gross scoring couldn't overcome high-variance Stableford brilliance.

The paradoxes multiplied from there. Stuart Newman finished second in the gross competition, just twelve strokes behind Mullin, yet collected the Wooden Spoon for his fifth-place Stableford finish—twenty-nine points adrift of Baker's winning total. Zero statistical correlation existed between the two competitions, as Mullin's seven-stroke gross range (his worst round a thoroughly respectable 21 over par) proved no match for Baker's capacity to rack up Stableford points in clusters. The tournament descended into disaster territory with fifty-eight zero-point holes across the field, including Gregg Williams's eleven blanks and a succession of triple-bogeys-or-worse that punctuated every round like exclamation marks of despair.

Yet amid the carnage, moments of brilliance flickered. Henry Meller alone managed multiple birdies—four in total—including back-to-back beauties on the 11th and 12th holes of Round 3, a rare oasis in a desert of bogeys. His reward? Rank fifth in Stableford despite those heroics, undone by ten zero-point holes of his own. The Algarve sun beat down on Boavista for four consecutive rounds, the course returning as host after TEG 2, but familiarity bred no comfort. This was golf as endurance test, Baker's wire-to-wire dominance the only constant as the field struggled to keep pace with either the leader or their own handicaps.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Baker Seizes Control While Disaster Strikes

Jon Baker took the lead on the opening hole and promptly set about establishing a cushion that would prove insurmountable. His 45-point opening salvo—a score that would remain a personal best throughout the tournament—gave him an eight-point advantage over David Mullin by day's end, while Mullin's 17-over-par gross staked an early claim to the Green Jacket with a two-stroke edge over Baker. The stage was set for dual narratives to unfold, though few could have predicted how completely they would diverge.

The round announced its disaster-laden character early. Newman suffered a triple-bogey at the 5th, Baker and Meller both carded triples at the 6th (where Williams added a quadruple for good measure), and Meller struck again with another triple at the 7th. Mullin briefly held the Stableford lead at the 6th before Baker wrestled it back at the 7th, never to relinquish it. The back nine proved no kinder. Williams endured triples at both the 10th and 17th, adding a quadruple at the 18th for a closing stretch that yielded just one point across holes 16-18. Meller's round imploded spectacularly at the 17th, where an octuple-bogey twelve sent him tumbling down the leaderboard. Only his birdie at the 16th—one of just five in the entire opening round—provided any counterbalance to the carnage.

Baker's 45 points came despite his own triple-bogeys at the 6th and 10th, a testament to his ability to score in bursts between the disasters. Mullin's front-nine dominance (21 points to 16 on the back) kept him in striking range, while Williams managed 18 points on the front nine only to see his challenge wither with thirteen on the back. The gap to Baker stood at eight points, but already the wire-to-wire narrative was taking shape.

**After Round 1:** JB: 45pts/+19; DM: 37pts/+17; HM: 33pts/+28; SN: 32pts/+22; GW: 31pts/+35

### Round 2: Baker Extends as Meller Surges and Collapses

Jon Baker's second-round 38 points extended his lead to eleven, the Stableford competition already assuming the characteristics of a procession. David Mullin matched Baker's output with 35 points while maintaining his two-stroke gross advantage, his 21-over-par keeping him comfortably clear in the Green Jacket race. But the round belonged—briefly, gloriously—to Henry Meller, whose front-nine burst papered over the cracks that would ultimately doom his challenge.

Meller's birdie at the 5th lifted him from fourth to third in the Stableford standings and anchored a stretch from holes 4-9 that yielded eighteen points, including four-point hauls at both the 5th and 8th. For six holes, averaging +0.17 versus par, he looked capable of mounting a genuine challenge. His front nine produced 23 points to just fifteen on the back, suggesting a player in control. Then reality intervened. While Meller avoided the worst disasters, his momentum evaporated on the back nine as the field collectively descended into chaos.

Gregg Williams suffered the round's most spectacular implosion: quadruple and triple bogeys at the 10th and 11th yielded zero points and anchored a stretch from holes 8-13 that produced just six points total. His closing triple at the 17th compounded the misery. Newman's own triple-bogeys at the 3rd and 14th—both blanks—saw him slip from fourth to fifth in the standings. Even Mullin couldn't escape unscathed, carding a quintuple-bogey at the 17th and following it with another disaster at the 18th, though his sixteen-over gross through sixteen holes had already secured another daily gross win.

Baker, meanwhile, coasted with 38 points—not spectacular by his opening-round standards, but more than sufficient to extend his advantage to eleven points over both Mullin and the surging Williams (35 points each). The breakaway had begun.

**After Round 2:** JB: 83pts/+45; DM: 72pts/+38; HM: 71pts/+46; GW: 66pts/+66; SN: 65pts/+43

### Round 3: Baker's Double-Edged Brilliance Amid the Birdie Burst

Jon Baker produced his second 45-point round of the tournament, matching his opening salvo and extending his lead to a commanding sixteen points despite opening and closing the round with disasters. That paradox—excellence bookended by catastrophe—defined a day when the field served up birdies and quintuple-bogeys in equal measure, the tournament's schizophrenic character reaching its zenith.

Baker's round began with a triple-bogey at the 1st (Meller matched him) and concluded with a quintuple at the 18th, yet the stretch in between yielded eighteen points from holes 6-11, including four-pointers at the 7th and 10th. His ability to score in clusters, to absorb disasters and immediately respond with point accumulation, proved the decisive difference. Mullin's 40 points and stunning 14-over-par gross—equaling the TEG all-time record—couldn't make a dent in Baker's lead, which grew from eleven to sixteen points. The dual competitions continued their separate trajectories: Baker dominant in Stableford, Mullin imperious in gross.

The round's dramatic centerpiece belonged to Henry Meller. After opening with a triple-bogey, quintuple-bogey (at the 3rd), and another disaster at the 6th—a stretch producing just six points across six holes—Meller authored the tournament's most memorable sequence. Triple-bogey at the 10th, blank. Then, somehow: birdie at the 11th, birdie at the 12th, consecutive red numbers averaging -0.33 versus par across holes 11-13. Four points became eight, the back nine surge (twenty points to thirteen on the front) hauling him back toward respectability. But by then the damage was done—he'd dropped from third to fifth in the standings, twelve points behind Baker becoming twenty-four.

Gregg Williams posted 41 points to move into third overall, his disasters (including a quadruple at the 2nd) offset by consistent scoring elsewhere. Newman's triple at the 9th kept him anchored in fifth, while the gap between Baker and the field yawned ever wider. Sixteen points with eighteen holes to play. The Trophy was all but decided.

**After Round 3:** JB: 128pts/+66; DM: 112pts/+52; GW: 107pts/+92; HM: 104pts/+74; SN: 101pts/+61

### Round 4: Baker Coasts Home as Mullin Seals the Double

Jon Baker's coronation arrived with all the drama of a Sunday stroll. His 36-point final round—comfortable rather than spectacular—secured a seventeen-point margin of victory, the largest winning margin in TEG history to that point and the capstone to a wire-to-wire performance that had seen him lead after every single hole of competition. Triple-bogeys at the 1st, 10th, 11th, and 17th? Irrelevant. Four-point hauls at the 8th and 16th more than compensated, and Baker's front-nine dominance (21 points to fifteen on the back) ensured no late drama would threaten his coronation.

David Mullin's 35 points and 20-over-par gross provided the day's other triumph, his twelve-stroke gross victory a monument to consistency that had seen him lead the gross competition for sixty-nine of seventy-two holes. His disaster at the 5th and another blank at the 11th couldn't derail a final-round gross performance that left Newman (second in gross for the tournament) trailing by a dozen strokes. The split champions told the tournament's essential story: Mullin's seven-stroke gross range—best round fourteen over, worst twenty-one—exemplified steady accumulation; Baker's Stableford brilliance relied on high-variance scoring that turned disasters into irrelevancies.

Newman's final round encapsulated the tournament's capacity for cruelty. His birdie at the 16th—four points, lifting him briefly from the Wooden Spoon position—was immediately negated by a sextuple-bogey ten at the 17th, zero points, plunging him straight back to bottom. He would finish fifth in Stableford despite claiming second in the gross competition, twenty-nine points behind Baker yet just twelve strokes behind Mullin. The mathematical disconnect was complete.

Gregg Williams's eleven zero-point holes across the tournament reached their nadir with disasters at the 3rd, 7th, 12th, and 17th in the final round alone. His front nine yielded eighteen points; his back nine, thirteen. Henry Meller's disaster-laden start (blanks at the 7th and 10th) gave way to a back-nine twenty points to thirteen on the front, but by then he'd secured fourth place overall, twenty-seven points behind the champion. The field had been comprehensively routed.

Baker's wire-to-wire supremacy was absolute: led after every round by eight, eleven, sixteen, and seventeen points. Never threatened. Never caught. His 164 points represented dominance in the Stableford format, even as Mullin's 72-over-par gross across four rounds—the most consistent ball-striking in the field—claimed the Green Jacket by a country mile. Two competitions, two deserving champions, zero correlation between them.

**Final Scores:** JB: 164pts/+94; DM: 147pts/+72; GW: 138pts/+127; HM: 137pts/+96; SN: 135pts/+84

## Tournament Recap

The TEG Trophy returned to Jon Baker after a performance of such sustained dominance that statistical anomalies multiplied in its wake. To lead every single hole of Stableford competition across four rounds suggests not merely superiority but a different plane of existence, where triple-bogeys and quintuple-bogeys become background noise to the relentless accumulation of points. His seventeen-point winning margin established a new benchmark for decisive victories, yet the triumph owed less to any single spectacular round than to an ability to score in bursts while his rivals hemorrhaged points to disaster.

David Mullin's second Green Jacket came via the opposite route: consistency as art form, seven strokes separating his best round from his worst, a gross performance that led the field for all but three holes. That such excellence translated to second place in the Stableford—fifteen points behind Baker's wire-to-wire procession—spoke to the competition's essential character. In a handicapped tournament, volatility beats steadiness. Mullin's twelve-stroke gross victory margin was impressive; that Stuart Newman finished second in gross yet fifth in Stableford, collecting the Wooden Spoon for his troubles, suggested a parallel universe where the same golf produced wildly divergent outcomes.

The fifty-eight zero-point holes told their own story of a tournament that ate players alive. Gregg Williams's eleven blanks led the field in futility, but everyone contributed their share of disasters. Henry Meller's four birdies—including those glorious consecutive red numbers on the 11th and 12th of Round 3—represented the only sustained brilliance in an otherwise unforgiving four days. The Algarve sun beat down on Boavista, the course exacting its toll with democratic ruthlessness, but Jon Baker emerged unscathed, his wire-to-wire dominance a rebuke to the chaos swirling around him. In the end, seventeen points said everything: some leads aren't merely comfortable, they're categorical.
