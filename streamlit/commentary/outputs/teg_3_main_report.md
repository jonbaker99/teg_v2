## Tournament Summary {#recap}

Jon Baker claimed his maiden Trophy with the most commanding wire-to-wire performance in tournament history. Leading all 72 Stableford holes across Boavista's parkland layout, Baker extended his advantage after every round, ultimately securing victory by 17 points despite the tournament's wildest round variance.

David Mullin dominated the parallel gross competition with equal authority, leading 69 of 72 holes to capture his second Green Jacket by 12 strokes. The split competitions produced contrasting narratives: Baker's volatile brilliance (rounds ranging 36-45 points) against Mullin's metronomic consistency (35-40 points, 14-21 gross).

Stuart Neumann's tournament embodied the format's peculiarity, finishing second in the Jacket whilst collecting his first career Wooden Spoon. Henry Meller's four birdies showcased genuine quality, yet two catastrophic blow-ups—a 12 at Round 1's 17th, followed by a 10 at Round 3's third—defined his week. Gregg Williams endured 11 zero-point disasters, finishing 55 strokes behind Mullin's gross total.

## Round 1: Baker Seizes Control {#round-1}

The Boavista parkland offered varied challenges across its two distinct sections, setting the stage for immediate separations in both competitions.

Baker seized the Trophy lead at the opening hole with a par and never relinquished it, posting 45 points to establish an eight-point cushion. The Jacket lead changed hands three times in the early holes—Baker to Mullin to Meller and back to Mullin—before the Irishman's level-par 71 settled matters. Neumann's 22 gross put him third in the Jacket despite ranking fourth in Stableford, the split already evident.

Meller's round encapsulated his tournament: a birdie four at the par-five 16th suggested quality, then the 17th delivered calamity. Twelve strokes. Eight over par. Zero points. A card-wrecker that transformed potential into disaster. Williams endured four zero-point blow-ups, including back-to-back nightmares at 17 and 18, his 35 gross strokes leaving him last in both competitions.

**Jacket Standings:** DM +17 | JB +19 | SN +22 | HM +28 | GW +35

## Round 2: Mullin Takes Command {#round-2}

Baker extended his Trophy advantage to 11 points with a 38-point round, whilst Mullin's 21 gross secured the Jacket lead he would never surrender.

Meller produced the day's finest golf—18 gross, 38 points, the tournament's joint-best Stableford performance. A birdie at the par-four fifth sparked an exceptional stretch through the ninth, where he averaged level par for six holes. Yet late collapses at 17 and 18 prevented genuine challenge. Williams suffered consecutive implosions at the 10th and 11th, recording zero points on both, then added another at the 17th.

Neumann's three blow-ups kept him grounded despite posting 21 gross to maintain second place in the Jacket. The divergence between competitions crystallised: Mullin dominated stroke play whilst Baker's net scoring proved untouchable.

Baker's consistency—38 points following his opening 45—contrasted with Mullin's tighter range, the Irishman rarely straying far from par. Williams' front-nine 21 points suggested resurgence before his back-nine 14 confirmed the familiar pattern.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 83 | DM 72 | HM 71 | GW 66 | SN 65  
**Jacket Standings:** DM +38 | SN +43 | JB +45 | HM +46 | GW +66

## Round 3: Baker's Second Surge {#round-3}

Baker matched his opening 45 points to push his Trophy lead to 16, whilst Mullin's 14 gross maintained his Jacket dominance.

Three immediate blow-ups set the tone: Meller's seven at the first, Williams and Baker both finding trouble at the second, then Meller's catastrophic ten at the par-five third. Five over par. Zero points. His second nightmare hole in 54. Baker weathered an eight at the fifth, then reeled off 18 points through 11 holes—four-point efforts at the seventh and 10th underpinning his authority.

Meller's resilience surfaced with consecutive birdies at 11 and 12, briefly illuminating quality before more mediocrity followed. His back-nine 20 points salvaged respectability from a front-nine 13. Williams climbed to third in the Trophy despite 26 gross, his 41 points exposing the split's absurdity. Neumann's 18 gross kept him second in the Jacket, 10 strokes behind Mullin.

Baker's nine at the 18th—five over par, zero points—mattered little. His 16-point cushion with 18 holes remaining made coronation inevitable.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 128 | DM 112 | GW 107 | HM 104 | SN 101  
**Jacket Standings:** DM +52 | SN +61 | JB +66 | HM +72 | GW +92

## Round 4: Coronation and Chaos {#round-4}

Baker cruised to his 17-point Trophy victory with 36 points, whilst Mullin's 20 gross sealed his second Jacket by a dozen strokes.

The opening hole delivered immediate carnage: Baker and Neumann both carding sevens. Baker recovered with four-point efforts at the eighth and 16th, maintaining comfortable control. Mullin's par consistency—three consecutive at the second through fourth—epitomised his week's metronomic excellence.

The Wooden Spoon battle provided late drama. Meller's eight at the seventh dropped him to last, only for Neumann's par to lift him clear. Neumann's birdie four at the par-five 16th seemed to secure safety, then the 17th struck. Ten strokes. Six over par. The tournament's third catastrophic blow-up, and Neumann's Spoon was secured.

Williams endured four more zero-point disasters, his tally reaching 11 for the tournament—35 gross leaving him last in the Jacket by 43 strokes. Meller's back-nine 20 points couldn't erase front-nine struggles, his four-birdie tournament overshadowed by two double-digit nightmares.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 164 | DM 147 | GW 138 | HM 137 | SN 135  
**Jacket Standings:** DM +72 | SN +84 | JB +94 | HM +96 | GW +127

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Jon Baker's maiden Trophy arrived via the most emphatic wire-to-wire performance yet witnessed. Leading all 72 Stableford holes, his 17-point margin understated the control he exerted—extending his advantage after every round despite posting the tournament's widest scoring range. His 36-45 point variance revealed volatility, yet he never surrendered the lead established at the opening hole.

David Mullin's second Green Jacket showcased contrasting brilliance: consistency over fireworks, precision over volatility. His 14-21 gross range and 35-40 Stableford spread proved the tightest in the field. Leading 69 of 72 holes, only brief early skirmishes threatened his dominance. The 12-stroke Jacket margin reflected comprehensive superiority.

The split competitions revealed their peculiar nature through Stuart Neumann's paradox: second in gross, last in Stableford, his maiden Wooden Spoon secured despite finishing 10 strokes clear of Williams in stroke play. Henry Meller's tournament swung between extremes—four birdies suggesting quality, two catastrophic blow-ups (12 and 10) defining outcome. His 24-point gap from fourth to third in the Trophy, despite matching Williams' 96 gross, exposed the format's duality.

Gregg Williams' 11 zero-point disasters painted the week's grimmest picture, his 127 gross strokes leaving him 55 behind Mullin. Baker's dominance across 72 holes set a new standard for control. No previous winner had led wire-to-wire with such authority, his performance all the more remarkable given his round-to-round volatility. Mullin's parallel gross supremacy confirmed split competition outcomes need share neither victor nor narrative.

## Player-by-Player Summary {#player-summary}

**Jon Baker (1st - Trophy, 3rd - Jacket):** Claimed maiden Trophy with the most dominant wire-to-wire performance in tournament history, leading all 72 Stableford holes and extending his advantage after every round. His 17-point margin belied volatile scoring (36-45 range), yet never looked threatened. Posted two 45-point rounds—matching the tournament's best—whilst enduring multiple blow-ups including a nine at Round 3's 18th. Finished third in Jacket, 22 strokes behind Mullin, embodying net scoring supremacy without gross dominance.

**David Mullin (2nd - Trophy, 1st - Jacket):** Secured second Green Jacket with metronomic consistency, leading 69 of 72 gross holes en route to a 12-stroke victory. Tightest scoring range in field (14-21 gross, 35-40 Stableford) showcased precision over volatility. Posted tournament's finest gross round (14 in Round 3) and never finished worse than second in any round's Jacket standings. Finished 17 points behind Baker in Trophy, the split competitions' divergence perfectly illustrated.

**Gregg Williams (3rd - Trophy, 5th - Jacket):** Climbed to third in Trophy with 41 points in Round 3 despite enduring 11 zero-point disasters across four rounds. Finished 55 strokes behind Mullin in Jacket, his 127 gross exposing the tournament's harshest struggles. Multiple blow-up sequences—including four in the final round alone—defined a week of relentless difficulty.

**Henry Meller (4th - Trophy, 4th - Jacket):** Tournament of extremes: four birdies showcased genuine quality, yet two catastrophic blow-ups (12 at R1H17, 10 at R3H3) wrecked card and spirit. Posted joint-best Stableford round (38 in Round 2) including birdie at par-four fifth, then suffered consecutive zero-point disasters. Strong back-nine finishes (20 points in R3 and R4) couldn't erase front-nine collapses, finishing 27 points behind Baker.

**Stuart Neumann (5th - Trophy, 2nd - Jacket, 1st - Wooden Spoon):** Embodied format's peculiarity: second in Jacket (10 strokes clear of Williams), yet last in Stableford earning maiden Wooden Spoon. Catastrophic 10 at R4H17 (six over par, zero points) immediately followed birdie at 16th. Consistent gross scoring (18-23 range) proved insufficient for Stableford success, multiple blow-ups bleeding crucial points despite maintaining second place in stroke play throughout final three rounds.
