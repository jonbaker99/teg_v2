# TEG 12 - Player Profiles

---

## John PATTERSON - 1st (Stableford: 172 pts, **3rd best ever**) | 4th (Gross: 96 strokes, +33)

Two years after collecting the wooden spoon with zero birdies and 112 points, John Patterson posted 172 Stableford pointsâ€”the third-best score in TEG historyâ€”to win his second trophy. This is golf's version of a comeback album that actually delivers.

**The Opening Statement:** Forty-six Stableford points in Round 1. Patterson's best-ever round opened a 4-point lead and announced "I remembered how to play golf." After two years of struggle, that 46 was redemption distilled to 18 holes.

**The Consistency:** 46-42-39-45. Started brilliantly, stayed brilliantly, finished brilliantly. Patterson led after every round, won Rounds 1 and 4, and made the tournament look easy. Led for 48 of 72 holes. Won by 10 points. This wasn't luckâ€”this was dominance.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd (Stableford: 162 pts, +10) | 3rd (Gross: 76 strokes, +13)

Gregg Williams posted 162 Stableford pointsâ€”tied for the fourth-best score everâ€”led for 33 holes, and still finished 10 points behind Patterson. This is becoming Gregg's signature: play brilliantly, lose to someone playing more brilliantly.

**The Early Lead:** Led after Round 2 with 80 points, 8 ahead of Stuart, looking like someone who might win his second Trophy. Then Patterson stayed Patterson, and Gregg's lead evaporated into "briefly competitive."

**The Rounds:** 42-38-38-44. Opened strong, maintained competently, finished strongly. Gregg never collapsed, never faded dramatically. He just couldn't match Patterson's relentless accumulation of points.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 3rd (Stableford: 155 pts, +17) | 6th (Gross: 122 strokes, +59)

Stuart Neumann holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 4 for eagleâ€”only the second eagle in 12 tournaments of TEG history. Eight years after Jon Baker's historic first, Stuartmatched it with a par 5 eagle that counted for 5 Stableford points and a permanent place in golf's most exclusive club.

**The Eagle:** Hole 15, Round 4, Aphrodite Hills. Par 5. Stuartholed his second shot for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. Only four eagles have been scored across 17 TEG tournaments, making Stu's achievement extraordinarily rare.

**Historical Context:** Jon Baker scored the first eagle at TEG 4 (par 4, R4 H8). Eight tournaments and 576 holes later, Stuartjoined him with a par 5 eagle. Eagles are so rare in TEG that Stu's achievement transcends his third-place finish.

## Jon BAKER - 4th (Stableford: 145 pts, +27) | 1st (Gross: 63 strokes, **2nd consecutive Green Jacket**)

Jon Baker finished fourth in Stableford with 145 points and won his second consecutive Green Jacket with 63 strokes over par. This is the David Mullin paradox perfected: dominate one competition while being thoroughly mediocre in the other.

**The gross Dominance:** Led 58 of 72 holes. Won all four rounds. Finished 8 strokes clear of David. The Green Jacket was never in doubt. Jon treated gross golf like a personal fiefdom.

**The Stableford Mediocrity:** Fourth place, 27 points behind Patterson. Jon never led a single hole in Stableford, never threatened the top three, spent four days being professionally forgettable in points while being dominant in strokes.

## Alex BAKER - 5th (Stableford: 143 pts, +29) | 5th (Gross: 104 strokes, +41)

Alex Baker posted 143 Stableford points to finish fifth, which is perfectly respectable and utterly forgettable when someone's scoring 172 and someone else is making the second eagle ever.

**The Rounds:** 35-35-33-40. Alex opened with identical 35-point rounds like someone on autopilot, faded to 33 in Round 3, then rallied with 40 in the finale when the tournament was over. This is the scoring pattern of someone who showed up, participated, achieved nothing memorable.

**Never Threatened:** Fifth after Round 1. Sixth after Round 2. Fifth after Round 3. Fifth at the finish. Alex spent TEG 12 occupying fifth place with the consistency of furniture.

---

## David MULLIN - 6th (**2nd consecutive Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 139 pts, +33) | 2nd (Gross: 71 strokes, +8)

After nine consecutive Green Jackets, David Mullin collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 139 Stableford points. Last place again. Second in gross again. The fall from dynasty to disaster was complete.

**Back-to-Back Spoons:** TEG 11: wooden spoon, 125 points. TEG 12: wooden spoon, 139 points. David has now finished last twice in a row after winning nine straight Green Jackets. This is golf's version of a Greek tragedy.

**The Stableford Disaster:** One hundred thirty-nine points, 33 behind Patterson, 4 behind fifth place. David wasn't even close to avoiding last place. He finished sixth in a six-player field by being comprehensively worse than everyone else.
