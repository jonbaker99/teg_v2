# TEG 5 Story Notes - THE PARADOX

## Key Points
- **THE PARADOX:** Dave wins Green Jacket AND wooden spoon! (Last net vs par scoring)
- **Jon Wins Trophy:** 156 pts (net vs par format), 11-pt margin over Gregg
- **Dave's 4th Consecutive GJ:** 92 gross strokes, 6 clear
- **Gregg's Best Finish:** 2nd with 145 pts (career high)
- **Net vs Par Format:** Last tournament before switch to Stableford (TEG 6+)

## How It Unfolded
R1: Jon 45 (+4 over Gregg 41), Dave 29 (last but leads gross!)
R2: Jon 38, Gregg 36, Dave 30 (still last, still leads gross)
R3: Jon 38, Henry 36 (3 birdies), Gregg 35, Dave 27
R4: Jon 35, Gregg 37, Stu 38, Henry 34, Dave 26

## The Beautiful Absurdity
- Dave: 4th consecutive GJ, first WS
- Same golf = champion AND disaster
- Net scoring hated Dave's high handicap
- Gross scoring loved Dave's consistency
- Golf's most absurd outcome

## Story Angles
- "Champion and wooden spoon holder - same weekend"
- Jon's wire-to-wire (again)
- Gregg's career-best 2nd
- Last net vs par tournament
