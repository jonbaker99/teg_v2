Stuart Neumann claimed his maiden TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance that saw him lead all 72 holes, winning by 13 points over Gregg Williams. The victory marked a complete reversal of fortune for Neumann, who had endured three consecutive Wooden Spoon finishes before this dominant breakthrough. Williams captured his second Green Jacket with an equally commanding wire-to-wire gross victory, leading every hole by 16 strokes over David Mullin, creating the tournament's first split championship in recent memory.

The split winners told the story of a paradoxical tournament—Williams posted the best gross score throughout yet finished second in the primary Stableford competition, while Neumann's consistency (never below 35 points in any round) proved more valuable than gross excellence. Mullin's tournament-best 45-point final round came three rounds too late, a devastating "what if" performance that would have won from any other day. Alex Baker's disaster spiral defined the bottom of the leaderboard, with 13 zero-point holes including a sextuple bogey and a catastrophic +7 on Round 4's 12th hole, earning him his third Wooden Spoon by a brutal 29-point margin.

The most remarkable aspect was the absence of drama at the top—both leaders never trailed, never faced serious pressure, and extended their advantages through the weekend in what became the most stable chase in TEG history.
