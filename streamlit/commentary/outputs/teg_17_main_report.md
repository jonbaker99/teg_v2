# TEG 17: Baker's Unstoppable March

Jon Baker claimed his fifth TEG Trophy and fourth Green Jacket with a performance of such relentless dominance that the tournament was effectively over before most competitors had unpacked their sunscreen. Leading 67 of 72 holes in the Stableford standings and 70 of 72 in gross scoring, Baker swept both competitions with an 18-point and 13-stroke margin respectively—a wire-to-wire masterclass that left the field scrambling for minor placings while he operated in a different timezone altogether.

The tournament's narrative arc bent entirely around Baker's gravitational pull, though Round 2 at West Cliffs provided the weekend's most dramatic bifurcation: David Mullin's tournament-best 47 points (briefly seizing the gross lead on the 18th) stood in stark contrast to John Patterson's historic 22-point implosion, the worst round of TEG 17 and a collapse that sent Patterson tumbling from first to fifth. That Patterson recovered to tie for third in Stableford with Alex Baker—who finished dead last in gross scoring, 83 strokes behind Baker—only adds to the tournament's collection of statistical curiosities.

The opening round at Praia D'El Rey set the tone for four days of high drama and frequent disaster, with 66 triple-bogeys-or-worse scattered across the field like wreckage from a particularly enthusiastic demolition derby. Patterson took a one-point lead despite a triple-bogey disaster at the 18th, surviving his own catastrophe through sheer accumulation. But Baker lurked one point back, and what followed was a lesson in sustainable excellence versus fleeting brilliance. By the time the field returned to Praia D'El Rey for Sunday's finale, Baker was cruising at such altitude that second-place Mullin (who finished 18 points adrift) might as well have been playing a different sport entirely.

Gregg Williams earned his second career Wooden Spoon with 123 points, while the Portuguese coastline served up its usual mix of Atlantic winds, championship courses, and opportunities for heroism and humiliation in roughly equal measure. Baker found considerably more of the former.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Patterson's Survival Act

John Patterson arrived at Praia D'El Rey carrying the weight of tournament expectation and the kind of opening-round chaos that would define TEG 17's character. Jon Baker seized the early Stableford lead at the third hole with a simple par—already a statement of intent in a field hemorrhaging strokes—while disasters multiplied around him like a contagion. David Mullin opened with a triple bogey. Patterson countered with a quadruple. Alex Baker, not to be outdone, produced a sextuple bogey at the fifth that would haunt him for four days, part of an eight-disaster, four-zero-point symphony of self-destruction that buried him in a 15-point deficit he'd never fully escape.

But Patterson, despite his own quadruple-bogey disaster at the sixth and catastrophic stretches that saw him average over four strokes above par from holes 5-7, possessed something the others lacked: a clutch gene on life support but still functional. His birdie at the 12th, a four-pointer at the 15th, and crucially another four-pointer at the 16th allowed him to snatch the Stableford lead from Baker with two holes remaining. Then came the 18th—a triple-bogey disaster that should have torpedoed his entire round. Instead, Patterson limped home with 39 points, one clear of Baker's 38, while Alex Baker added a quintuple bogey to complete the most calamitous round of his TEG career.

The gross leaderboard told a different story: Baker and Gregg Williams both carded +20 to share the lead, while Patterson's 23 strokes over par left him in third. Mullin's birdie on 13 anchored a hot spell from holes 11-16 that produced 18 points and kept him within touching distance, but the day belonged to Patterson—by the narrowest of margins and the skin of his catastrophically-tested teeth.

### Round 2: The Great Bifurcation

West Cliffs delivered the tournament's defining moment, though it arrived in two diametrically opposed forms. Jon Baker seized both the Stableford and gross leads at the first hole and never relinquished the former, his birdie on the fourth anchoring a six-hole opening stretch (18 points) that announced his intentions with admirable clarity. David Mullin, meanwhile, embarked on the round of the tournament: 47 points built on back-to-back birdies at 9 and 10, another at 15, and a hot spell from holes 7-12 that accumulated 18 points. His gross score of +10 briefly gave him the outright lead on the 18th hole—West Cliffs' one moment of genuine suspense regarding who might actually win this thing.

Then there was John Patterson, whose catastrophic middle passage will be studied in future TEG seminars as a case study in total structural collapse. Disasters at holes 9, 10, and 11 produced three consecutive zeros—a hat-trick of horror that saw him average three strokes over par from holes 9-11. The 13th brought a quintuple bogey. The 15th, as if to confirm that rock bottom had a basement, delivered a sextuple bogey. Patterson's 22 points represented the tournament's nadir, dropping him from first to fifth and 21 points behind Baker, who led all 18 holes in Stableford and maintained the gross lead throughout despite Mullin's late surge.

Alex Baker provided the round's consolation narrative, rising from fifth to third in Stableford with 37 points despite a gross score of +33 that left him anchored in last place. His hot spell from holes 4-9 (18 points, including a four-pointer on the fifth) couldn't overcome consecutive disasters at 10 and 11, but it was enough to leapfrog the imploding Patterson and the fading Williams, who dropped from tied-third to fourth.

**After Round 2:** J. Baker: 82pts; DM: 80pts; A. Baker: 69pts; GW: 68pts; JP: 61pts

### Round 3: Baker's Coronation Rehearsal

Royal Óbidos was supposed to provide drama. Instead, it hosted Jon Baker's extended victory parade, a 44-point round that stretched his Stableford lead to 11 and confirmed what everyone already suspected: barring an act of God or a catastrophic loss of motor function, the trophy was his. Baker's birdies on 11 and 13 (combined for 11 points from holes 11-13) headlined a back-nine surge (26 points) that turned comfortable into insurmountable, while his gross score of 14 over par—a course record 86 at Royal Óbidos—demonstrated that excellence in one format need not imply proficiency in comparative scoring.

John Patterson mounted the day's most credible challenge, his 41 points built on a back-nine rally (24 points) that featured a birdie on the eighth and a four-pointer on the 18th. But disasters at 9 and 11 (averaging 2.67 over par from holes 9-11) kept him at arm's length, and his gross score of +22 left him tied with Mullin in second. Mullin himself managed 35 points despite losing the lead at the fifth and sixth holes before Baker reasserted control at the seventh and never looked back.

Alex Baker's round encapsulated his tournament paradox: 34 points good enough for fourth in Stableford, but a gross score of +38 that included disasters at 4, 5, 14, 16, and 18—the latter a catastrophe after his birdie on the third had briefly promised better things. His six-over-par disaster at the 14th coincided with Gregg Williams hitting the Wooden Spoon bottom, though Patterson's four-pointer on 18 lifted him clear. Baker led from the second hole onward, briefly surrendered control at the sixth before reclaiming it at the seventh, and spent the final 12 holes in a state of untroubled superiority that bordered on the soporific.

**After Round 3:** J. Baker: 126pts; DM: 115pts; JP: 102pts; A. Baker: 103pts; GW: 94pts

### Round 4: The Inevitable Conclusion

Back at Praia D'El Rey for the final round, Jon Baker completed his procession to a fifth TEG Trophy with the kind of relaxed authority that suggested he might simultaneously be answering emails and planning dinner reservations. His 40 points, built on birdies at the fourth (four points) and fifth (five points) and anchored by an 11-point hot spell from holes 3-5, extended his final margin to 18 points over Mullin. The gross competition had long since ceased to matter as a contest, but Baker's 19-over-par round confirmed his 13-stroke supremacy there as well.

David Mullin's 33 points secured second place, 18 points behind Baker—a gap that illustrated the gulf between sustained excellence and mere competence. John Patterson, whose tournament arc had traced a perfect parabola from triumph to disaster to partial redemption, matched Mullin's 33 points to claim a share of third alongside Alex Baker, who also posted 32 points despite his gross score of +38 leaving him stranded in last place overall, 83 strokes behind the winner.

Patterson's final round featured the kind of spectacular disasters that had defined his middle rounds: a quadruple bogey at the first, sextuples at the 14th and 15th (averaging 4.33 over par from holes 13-15), and a general air of controlled chaos that produced a front-nine of 21 points but a back-nine of just 12. Alex Baker's triple bogeys at 7, 8, and 11, followed by quadruples at 12 and 13, ensured his strange split personality—Stableford contender, gross catastrophe—persisted to the bitter end. Williams' quintuple-or-worse at the first (five over par) set the tone for his 29-point round and confirmed his Wooden Spoon destiny.

Baker led from start to finish, never threatened, never flustered, never offering even a glimpse of vulnerability. It was, in its way, the perfect encapsulation of dominance: not flashy, not dramatic, just utterly, relentlessly effective.

**Final Standings:** J. Baker: 166pts/+67; DM: 148pts/+80; JP: 135pts/+124; A. Baker: 135pts/+150; GW: 123pts/+89

## Tournament Recap

Jon Baker's fifth TEG Trophy and fourth Green Jacket represent a kind of statistical inevitability made flesh—a performance so comprehensive that even the brief moments of drama (Patterson's opening-round survival, Mullin's Round 2 heroics, the occasional lead change) served mainly to emphasize how completely Baker controlled proceedings. Leading 67 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross scoring isn't dominance; it's occupancy. Baker simply moved in, made himself comfortable, and refused to leave.

The tournament's supporting narratives—Patterson's historic 22-point collapse, Alex Baker's strange split between Stableford competence and gross incompetence, the 66 collective disasters scattered across four rounds like landmines—provided texture and entertainment value, but couldn't alter the fundamental truth: this was Baker's tournament from the moment Patterson triple-bogeyed the 18th in Round 1. That Patterson recovered to tie for third, that Mullin briefly threatened in gross scoring, that Alex Baker finished fifth in gross despite tying for third in Stableford—all these curiosities enriched the story without changing its conclusion.

The return to Portugal's Lisbon Coast, with its familiar rotation of Praia D'El Rey, West Cliffs, and Royal Óbidos, provided a worthy stage for Baker's procession. That Gregg Williams claimed his second career Wooden Spoon, that the field combined for a festival of disasters that would make a casualty ward look understaffed, that David Mullin's tournament-best 47 points in Round 2 couldn't prevent him finishing 18 points behind—these are the footnotes to a dominant performance that redefined wire-to-wire excellence. Baker didn't just win TEG 17. He occupied it, controlled it, and made everyone else play a different tournament entirely.
