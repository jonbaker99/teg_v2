# TEG 17: Baker's Wire-to-Wire Dominance Delivers Historic Double {#report-title}

<p id="dateline">Portugal, Lisbon Coast • 2024</p>

Jon Baker secured his fifth TEG Trophy and fourth Green Jacket with the most commanding performance in tournament history. Leading 67 of 72 holes in the Stableford competition and 70 of 72 in the Gross, Baker swept both titles with final margins that flattered his rivals: 18 points over David Mullin in the Trophy, 13 strokes ahead in the Jacket.

The wire-to-wire victory bore Baker's trademark ruthlessness. He seized control in Round 2, briefly surrendered the Jacket lead four times in Round 3, then cruised home with characteristic efficiency. His consistency proved devastating—standard deviation of just 3.0 points across four rounds whilst John Patterson's volatility swung wildly at 8.5 points.

Behind Baker's procession, Patterson authored the tournament's defining subplot: a historic 22-point Round 2 collapse that transformed overnight leader into statistical footnote. Mullin's tournament-best 47 points in that same round couldn't salvage his sluggish start. Gregg Williams' paradox completed the narrative: led the Jacket after Round 1, finished with the Wooden Spoon.

## Round 1: Patterson's False Dawn {#round-1}

Patterson's opening 39 points suggested a title challenge. Williams and Baker shared the Jacket lead at level par through the first hole before Praia D'El Rey's chaos theory took hold.

Alex Baker's front nine dissolved into carnage—zero points at the 3rd, 4th, and quintuple-bogey disaster at the 5th. His 10 strokes there bled crucial momentum, dropping him from Trophy contention by the turn. Williams faded similarly, triple at the 5th contributing to his own struggles. Yet Patterson thrived, birdie at the 12th and four-point hauls at the 9th, 15th, and 16th building his slender one-point advantage. Jon Baker's late wobbles—zero points at both the 10th and 17th—handed Patterson overnight control.

Mullin's round encapsulated volatility. Triple bogeys at the 1st and 2nd plunged him to last place by the second hole. His recovery featured sustained excellence—18 points across holes 9-14 including a birdie at the 13th—but the damage lingered. By day's end, the lead group bunched tightly: Patterson's 39 points, Baker's 38, then Mullin and Williams tied on 33. Alex Baker's 32 left him last.

## Round 2: Collapse and Redemption {#round-2}

Baker required just one hole to reclaim what was rightfully his. Patterson's triple bogey at the opening hole handed over the Trophy lead permanently. What followed ranks amongst tournament history's darkest implosions.

Between holes 9 and 15, Patterson recorded six consecutive zeros. The carnage peaked at the 13th—10 strokes for +5—then the 15th, where 11 strokes produced a quintuple bogey. Eight zero-point holes total. His 22-point round stands as the tournament's worst recorded performance, a 44-over-par horror show that dropped him from first to fifth overnight.

Whilst Patterson's tournament burned, Mullin produced West Cliffs' masterpiece. His 47 points shattered the previous tournament record, fuelled by back-to-back birdies at the 9th and 10th. The stretch from holes 5-10 yielded 18 points of sustained brilliance. Yet Mullin's artistry merely trimmed Baker's advantage to two points—hardly a threatening margin given what would follow.

Baker's birdie at the 4th anchored his 44-point round. His only blemish came late, triple at the 17th, but by then the damage to his rivals was comprehensive. Williams' 35 points and Alex Baker's 37 left them trailing badly. The narrative shifted from Patterson's challenge to whether anyone could mount one.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 82 | DM 80 | AB 69 | GW 68 | JP 61  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +34 | JB +38 | GW +61 | AB +78 | JP +95

## Round 3: Baker's Stranglehold {#round-3}

Royal Óbidos witnessed Baker's only wobble—and his swift correction. His triple at the opening hole surrendered the Jacket lead. He regained it at the 2nd, lost it briefly at the 6th to Mullin, then seized it permanently at the 7th. Those four lead changes across six holes constituted the tournament's only genuine contest for either title.

Baker's back nine dismantled any lingering hope. Birdies at the 11th and 13th anchored a stretch where he scored 20 points across holes 11-16. His 44-point round extended his Trophy lead from two points to 11—a breakaway margin that rendered Sunday a procession. The 86 strokes set the Royal Óbidos course record.

Patterson's resilience deserved credit despite the Round 2 wreckage. His 41 points featured a birdie at the 8th before another blow-up at the 9th and quintuple at the 11th reminded everyone of his fragility. That inconsistency—17 points on the front nine, 24 on the back—defined his tournament. Mullin's 35 points kept him second but fell nine shy of pressuring Baker.

Alex Baker's quintuple at the 14th typified his week. The blow-up followed his birdie at the 3rd, encapsulating a tournament of extremes that left him third but never threatening. Williams' 26-point collapse dropped him to last in the Trophy standings, already eyeing the Spoon with Sunday ahead.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 126 | DM 115 | AB 103 | JP 102 | GW 94  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +52 | DM +56 | JP +72 | GW +88 | AB +116

## Round 4: Coronation {#round-4}

Baker's final-round 40 points merely confirmed inevitability. His birdies at the 4th and 5th anchored the front nine, scoring 11 points across holes 3-5. The 18-point final margin over Mullin flattered his rivals—Baker's dominance went far beyond the final numbers.

Mullin's 33 points secured second place in both competitions, his tournament-best Round 2 offsetting the opening-day struggles. Patterson's 33 points lifted him to joint-third in the Trophy despite the Round 2 catastrophe, though his Jacket performance lagged in fourth. More blow-ups arrived—a sextuple at the 14th, quintuple at the 15th—reminding everyone why 18 zero-point holes across four rounds told the definitive story of his week.

Alex Baker's 32 points couldn't prevent him slipping to joint-third, triple bogeys at the 12th and 13th draining his final momentum. Williams' 29 points confirmed the Spoon, his opening-round quintuple at the 1st setting the tone for a closing stretch that never recovered from Saturday's collapse.

Baker completed the wire-to-wire sweep. Five birdies total. Led both competitions after every round. Won by margins—18 points, 13 strokes—that understated his control. The numbers tell the story: 67 of 72 holes led in Stableford, 70 of 72 in Gross. Tournament dominance distilled to its purest form.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 166 | DM 148 | JP 135 | AB 135 | GW 123  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +67 | DM +80 | GW +89 | JP +124 | AB +150

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Baker's fifth Trophy and fourth Jacket arrived via wire-to-wire dominance unprecedented in tournament history. Leading after every round in both competitions, his 18-point Trophy margin over Mullin and 13-stroke Jacket advantage rendered Sunday's action ceremonial. The consistency proved lethal: standard deviation of 3.0 points whilst Patterson's 8.5 volatility encapsulated the chaos beneath.

Patterson's tournament split into two opposing narratives. His opening 39 points built a fleeting overnight lead before Round 2's historic collapse—22 points with eight zeros—transformed promise into wreckage. The catastrophic sequence from holes 9-15 featured a 10 at the 13th and 11 at the 15th. Despite recovering to joint-third in the Trophy, his 18 zero-point holes across four rounds (25% of his tournament) defined the week. His resilience in Rounds 3-4 couldn't overcome the damage.

Mullin's tournament-record 47 points in Round 2 deserved better context than second place. The back-to-back birdies at the 9th and 10th highlighted sustained excellence—18 points across holes 5-10—yet his opening-round struggles left him chasing shadows. His wire-to-wire second place in both competitions represented solid consistency but never threatened Baker's stranglehold.

Williams' paradox completed the narrative. Led the Jacket after Round 1 before fading to the Wooden Spoon, his 26-point Round 3 collapse dropping him from contention. Third in the Jacket but last in the Trophy—the format's cruel mathematics on full display. Alex Baker's volatile week featured 12 zero-point holes including the quintuple at Round 3's 14th, his joint-third finish reflecting moments of promise drowned by repeated blow-ups.

Baker's dominance extended beyond final margins. He led 137 combined holes across both competitions—67 of 72 in Stableford, 70 of 72 in Gross. Five birdies punctuated rounds built on relentless efficiency. His fifth Trophy and fourth Jacket cement his status as tournament royalty. The wire-to-wire sweep? Just confirmation of what everyone already knew.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER SUMMARY

**Jon BAKER (1st - Trophy & Jacket):** Fifth Trophy, fourth Jacket, both via wire-to-wire dominance that rewrote tournament history. Led 67 of 72 holes in Stableford, 70 of 72 in Gross, winning by 18 points and 13 strokes respectively. Standard deviation of 3.0 points across four rounds proved consistency's lethal edge.

**David MULLIN (2nd - Trophy & Jacket):** Tournament-record 47 points in Round 2 couldn't overcome opening-day struggles. Back-to-back birdies at 9th-10th highlighted sustained brilliance—18 points across holes 5-10—but finished 18 points behind Baker. Wire-to-wire runner-up in both competitions represented solid consistency without ever threatening victory.

**John PATTERSON (3rd - Trophy, 4th - Jacket):** Opening 39 points built overnight lead before Round 2's historic 22-point collapse destroyed his challenge. Eight zero-point holes that round—including 10 at the 13th, 11 at the 15th—stand as tournament's worst performance. Resilient recovery in Rounds 3-4 lifted him to joint-third despite 18 total zeros across four rounds.

**Alex BAKER (3rd - Trophy, 5th - Jacket):** Twelve zero-point holes defined a volatile week featuring both promise and repeated blow-ups. Quintuple at Round 3's 14th typified extremes that left him joint-third in Trophy but last in Jacket. Birdie at Round 3's 3rd and Round 2's 12th hinted at quality buried beneath chaos.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (5th - Trophy, 3rd - Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Led Jacket after Round 1 before collapsing to Wooden Spoon. Twenty-six-point Round 3 implosion dropped him from contention, finishing third in Jacket but last in Trophy. The format's cruel mathematics personified: competent gross performance insufficient without Stableford success.
