# TEG 11 - Player Profiles

---

## Jon BAKER - 1st (Stableford: 143 pts) | 1st (Gross: 70 strokes, **FIRST Green Jacket**)

Jon Baker arrived at PGA Catalunya and proceeded to demonstrate what "dominance" actually looks like. Led after every single round in both competitions. Won all four gross rounds. Led 70 of 72 possible holes in gross. This wasn't golfâ€”this was a masterclass in making everyone else irrelevant.

**The Rounds:** 35-32-37-39 Stableford points. Opened strong, stayed strong, finished strong. Jon never faded, never panicked, never gave anyone hope. The closest competitor after Round 3 was seven points back. By Round 4, it was academic.

**The gross Annihilation:** Won every single round. Led 70 of 72 holes. Finished 3 strokes clear of David, ending his nine-tournament Green Jacket streak. Jon didn't just win the jacketâ€”he buried David's dynasty.

## Alex BAKER - 2nd (Stableford: 137 pts, +6) | 4th (Gross: 106 strokes, +36)

Alex Baker finished second with 137 Stableford points and zero birdies in 72 holes. ZERO. Not one. Alex spent four days playing competent golf without once threatening to be excellent, which is both impressive and deeply sad.

**The Opening Lead:** Round 1's 32 points led the tournament. For approximately 18 holes, Alex looked like he might repeat his TEG 10 heroics. Then Jon posted 35 in Round 1, and Alex's lead evaporated into "briefly competitive."

**The Fade:** After leading R1, Alex posted 32-33-40 across the final three rounds. Solid. Respectable. Thoroughly insufficient to challenge Jon's relentless march to victory. By Round 3, Alex was seven points back. By Round 4, the gap was six. Runner-up secured, victory never threatened.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 3rd (Stableford: 136 pts, +7) | 3rd (Gross: 99 strokes, +29)

Gregg Williams posted 136 Stableford points to claim bronze, one point behind Alex, seven behind Jon. Gregg spent TEG 11 being very good while Jon was being historic and Alex was being slightly better.

**The Rounds:** 28-31-38-39. Gregg started slowly (5th after R1), improved gradually (4th after R2, 3rd after R3), then posted a strong 39-point finale to secure bronze. The scoring progression of someone who woke up halfway through and remembered how to play golf.

**The Challenge That Wasn't:** Gregg never led a single hole in either competition. Never threatened Jon. Spent four days being professionally competent while the trophy was decided elsewhere.

## John PATTERSON - 4th (Stableford: 135 pts, +8) | 5th (Gross: 123 strokes, +53)

John Patterson posted 135 Stableford points and zero birdies, marking his second consecutive tournament without a birdie. That's 144 holes total without once playing better than par. At some point, this stops being a drought and becomes a lifestyle choice.

**The Rounds:** 30-30-34-41. Patterson opened with identical 30-point rounds like someone on autopilot, woke up in Round 3 with 34 points, then posted a career-best 41 in the finale when the tournament was already over.

**The Too-Little-Too-Late Rally:** That 41-point finale was brilliant. Also irrelevant. Patterson discovered how to score points in Round 4, three rounds after it would've mattered. Timing is everything, and Patterson's timing was terrible.

## David MULLIN - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 125 pts, +18) | 2nd (Gross: 73 strokes, +3)

After nine consecutive Green Jackets, David Mullin collected his first wooden spoon. Last place in Stableford. Second in gross (3 behind Jon). The dynasty ended not with a bang but with 125 Stableford points and the knowledge that dominance is temporary.

**The Collapse:** One hundred twenty-five points. David's worst Stableford performance in 11 tournaments. Finished 18 points behind the winner, 10 behind fourth place. This wasn't closeâ€”this was comprehensive failure.

**The gross Consolation:** Second place, 3 strokes behind Jon. David won zero gross rounds (Jon won all four). Led for 10 holes midway through. Never threatened after Round 2. The nine-jacket streak ended with a whimper.
