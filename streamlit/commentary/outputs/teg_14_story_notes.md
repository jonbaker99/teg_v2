# TEG 14 Story Notes

## Key Points
- David MULLIN's 3rd Trophy & 10th Green Jacket - swept both competitions with wire-to-wire dominance
- Won by 2 points (Stableford) and 7 strokes (Gross) - most commanding victory in recent TEGs
- Led 60/72 holes (Stableford) and 70/72 holes (Gross) - near-total control
- Jon BAKER's shocking Wooden Spoon - first career spoon despite 4 birdies in final round
- AB closed gap from 8 to 2 points in final round but fell just short

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** DM 40pts leads by 3; DM +15 leads Gross by 5
- **Round 2:** DM extends to 9-point lead with back-to-back 40+ rounds; AB struggles with 5 disasters
- **Round 3:** DM 36pts holds 8-point lead; GW surges to 2nd with 39pts; JB implodes with 5 disasters
- **Round 4:** AB's 43pts closes gap to 2; JB's 4 birdies can't overcome 11 zero-point holes; DM cruises home

## Story Angles
- MULLIN's dominant sweep - only player to lead after all four rounds in both competitions
- The paradox of Jon BAKER - 5 birdies but 11 disasters equals first career Wooden Spoon
- AB's late charge falls agonizingly short despite best round (43pts) on final day
- MULLIN's consistency - never worse than 41pts, led 70/72 holes in Gross
- The +6 catastrophe - AB's H16 disaster in Round 4 likely cost him the Trophy
- JB's wild variance - best gross round (83) alongside tournament-high 11 zero-point holes

## Quote-Worthy Lines
- "Wire-to-wire dominance"
- "Five birdies, first spoon"
- "Two points shy"
- "Seventy of seventy-two"
- "Catastrophic sixteen"
- "Back-to-back forties"
