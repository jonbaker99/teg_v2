John Patterson claimed his second TEG Trophy with a commanding wire-to-wire performance after Round 3, winning by 10 points with remarkably consistent scoring. His 172-point total came from just a five-point range (40-45 points per round), demonstrating metronomic consistency that became the tournament's defining characteristic. Meanwhile, Jon Baker secured his second Green Jacket with an eight-stroke margin, leading all 72 holes in the gross competition to complete a historic split outcome—the first time in five TEGs that the Trophy and Green Jacket winners diverged.

The tournament pivoted dramatically in Round 3 when Patterson's 45 points coincided with Gregg Williams' implosion. Williams, who had led both competitions through 36 holes, posted just 36 points after back-to-back disasters on holes 12 and 13, including a septuple bogey that shattered his chances. Williams ultimately finished runner-up, 10 points back, while Baker's gross dominance told a contrasting story—he ranked just fourth in Stableford despite never trailing in the stroke-play competition.

David Mullin's tournament embodied the split narrative's tragic side: his runner-up finish in gross (+71, eight strokes behind Baker) couldn't prevent him from collecting his third Wooden Spoon after finishing last in Stableford with 139 points. Three consecutive disasters spanning holes 3-4-10 in Round 4 sealed his fate, though he rallied with birdies on 12 and 14 to salvage some dignity in a brilliantly flawed performance.
