# TEG 12 Brief Summary

John Patterson won his second TEG Trophy with 172 Stableford pointsâ€”the third-best score in TEG historyâ€”completing a remarkable redemption arc from wooden spoon (TEG 10) to champion in two years. Patterson led wire-to-wire, winning by 10 points over Gregg Williams (162) after opening with a career-best 46 points.

Stuart Neumann holed his second shot on a par 5 (Hole 15, Round 4) for eagleâ€”only the second eagle in 12 tournaments of TEG history, eight years after Jon Baker's historic first. Eagles remain extraordinarily rare, with only four scored across 17 tournaments.

Jon Baker won his second consecutive Green Jacket from fourth place in Stableford (145 points), leading 58 of 72 holes in Gross and finishing 8 strokes clear of Dave Mullin (71). David collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 139 Stableford points after winning nine consecutive Green Jackets.

**Winner (Stableford):** John PATTERSON - 172 points
**Green Jacket (Gross):** Jon BAKER - 63 strokes over par
**Wooden Spoon:** David MULLIN - 139 points
**Historic Achievement:** Stuart NEUMANN - 2nd ever TEG eagle (R4, H15, Par 5)
