## TEG 15: Lisbon Coast, Portugal (2022)

Gregg Williams swept both the Trophy and Green Jacket at TEG 15, dominating from start to finish with record-breaking margins. Williams won the Stableford by 21 points and the Gross by 29 strokes—both tournament records—after seizing the lead at H3 in Round 1 and never looking back. His Round 3 course record of 44 points at Penha Longa, featuring three back-nine birdies, sealed the victory and left the field with no answer.

Stuart Neumann claimed career-best runner-up in the Trophy (136 points) despite a catastrophic H18 quintuple blow-up in Round 4 that nearly derailed his finish. Jon Baker took second in the Jacket despite 13 meltdowns across the week, including a nightmarish 11 on H17 in Round 2. Alex Baker collected his second career Wooden Spoon, finishing 43 points behind Williams with a tournament-worst quintuple on H14 in Round 3.

David Mullin's eagle on H15 in Round 2 was a rare bright spot in his disappointing fifth-place Trophy finish. The tournament returned to the Lisbon Coast after a six-year absence, featuring two new courses (Estoril, West Cliffs) alongside familiar favorites Penha Longa and Oitavos Dunes.
