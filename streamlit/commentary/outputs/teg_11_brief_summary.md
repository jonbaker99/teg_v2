# TEG 11: Jon Baker's Breakthrough Sweep in Catalonia

The eleventh TEG Trophy returned to Catalonia in 2018, revisiting PGA Catalunya's two championship courses from TEG 6 and debuting El Prat's Azul Course. Jon Baker claimed both the Trophy and Green Jacket in wire-to-wire fashion, leading 70 of 72 holes in the gross competition and 59 holes in Stableford.

Baker's dominance was comprehensive: a six-point Trophy margin over brother Alex, and three strokes in the Jacket over David Mullin. The victory included a Round 2 course record 84 at PGA Catalunya Tour and Jon's first Green Jacket after two prior Trophy wins. Alex Baker held the Trophy lead entering the final round after posting a career-best 42 points in Round 2, only to card a career-worst 27 in Round 4 as Jon surged past at the sixth holeâ€”a 15-point swing that sealed the sweep.

Mullin suffered the tournament's cruellest fate: his Wooden Spoon arrived despite finishing runner-up in the Jacket by just three strokes, having briefly held the gross lead twice on the final day. John Patterson's volatile week featured 21 triple-or-worse blow-ups yet included a 39-point Round 3 that lifted him from fifth to fourth.
