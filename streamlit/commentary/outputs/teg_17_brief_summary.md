Jon Baker swept both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance that saw him lead 67 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in Gross. His 18-point Trophy margin and 13-stroke Jacket advantage over David Mullin represented total control—never seriously challenged after seizing both leads in Round 2. The defining moment came early in Round 2 when Baker birdied the fourth hole, took the Stableford lead from John Patterson, and never looked back.

The tournament told two contrasting stories in Round 2: Mullin's magnificent 47-point surge—the tournament's best round—briefly gave him the Gross lead on the final hole, while Patterson suffered a historic collapse. Patterson's 22-point disaster included eight zero-point holes and dropped him from first to fifth in a single day, the worst round in TEG history. He recovered to tie for third with Alex Baker, who remarkably finished joint-third in Stableford despite placing last in Gross, 83 strokes behind Baker.

Patterson's opening round provided early drama when he took the Stableford lead at the 16th hole, then survived a triple-bogey disaster at 18 to win by a single point. That wire-to-wire potential evaporated 24 hours later in the middle-round nightmare that defined his tournament.
