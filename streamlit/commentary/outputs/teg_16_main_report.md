## Tournament Summary {#recap}

Stuart Neumann claimed his first TEG Trophy with a dominant wire-to-wire performance across Portugal's finest courses, erasing three previous wooden spoon finishes with authority. Leading all 72 holes in the Stableford competition, Neumann's 156-point total secured a crushing 13-point victory over Gregg Williams, who mounted no serious challenge despite finishing runner-up.

The trophy and jacket split told parallel stories of complete control. Williams claimed his second Green Jacket with matching dominance in the gross competition, leading all 72 holes and finishing 16 strokes clear. His consistency proved remarkable: never worse than +22 in any round, posting 30 pars across the week.

David Mullin threatened briefly in Round 2 but faded to third. Jon Baker's challenge collapsed spectacularly at Penha Longa's 12th hole with a quintuple bogey, part of a back-to-back blow-up that ended his trophy hopes. Alex Baker's tournament nightmare included 13 zero-point holes and a catastrophic +7 at the final round's 12th, sealing his third wooden spoon by 29 points.

## Round 1: Opening Salvo at Oitavos {#round-1}

Stuart Neumann seized the Trophy lead at the first hole of the tournament and never relinquished it. His opening 39 points at Oitavos Dunes established a five-point cushion over a congested chasing pack. Williams and Jon Baker tied at 34 points, whilst Williams and David Mullin shared the early Jacket lead at +18.

Alex Baker's tournament horror began immediately: a nine at the opening hole, zero points registered. Another nine arrived at the seventh, then the 11th. By the 17th, he'd posted a ten. Four zero-point holes in one round, finishing +42 and seven triple bogeys recorded. Mullin suffered his own collapse mid-round, blow-ups at the eighth and tenth derailing what had been a promising start.

Neumann's authority wasn't flawless. An eight at the seventh and matching sevens at the 17th and 18th prevented genuine separation. But his five-point margin felt comfortable against a field already showing cracks. Williams' consistency shone: leading the gross competition wire-to-wire from the opening hole, never wobbling.

**Trophy Standings:** SN 39 | GW 34 | JB 34 | DM 33 | AB 29  
**Green Jacket Standings:** GW +18 | JB +21 | DM +23 | SN +26 | AB +42

## Round 2: Troia Trebles and Birdie Bonanza {#round-2}

Neumann extended his Trophy lead to seven points at the new venue, Troia, despite a closing wobble that threatened his authority. A brilliant holes 10-12 stretch—featuring a birdie at the tenth and 11 Stableford points—built a commanding cushion before late blow-ups at the 13th, 16th and 17th allowed Mullin to close within seven.

The 10th hole produced rare drama: a three-way birdie fest. Alex Baker, Jon Baker and Neumann all found success, the only bright spot in Alex's otherwise torturous round. Those five points at the tenth represented his tournament high-water mark before disaster resumed.

Jon Baker traded the Jacket lead twice during the round, gaining it at the 11th and 14th before Williams wrestled it back. Baker's challenge ended at the 17th: a six at the par-three, zero points, his momentum shattered. Williams maintained his gross lead throughout, remarkably consistent at +22 for the round. Twenty blow-ups across all players told the story of Troia's bite.

**Trophy Standings:** SN 74 | DM 67 | JB 66 | GW 64 | AB 61  
**Green Jacket Standings:** GW +40 | JB +44 | DM +45 | SN +56 | AB +76

## Round 3: Penha Longa Carnage {#round-3}

Neumann broke away at Penha Longa with 39 points, extending his Trophy lead to 12 whilst Williams posted the tournament's finest gross round: 87, just +15. Three birdies lit up the round—Neumann at the sixth, Jon Baker at the seventh, Williams at the fifth—before Penha's mountains exacted revenge.

The 12th hole delivered catastrophe. Jon Baker posted a ten, five over par, zero points. A quintuple bogey. The very next hole: an eight, another zero. Two consecutive disasters, 1 Stableford point from holes 11-13. His challenge evaporated. Alex Baker suffered matching torment at the same stretch: nines at both the 12th and 13th, extending his zero-point tally to nine holes.

Williams' back nine brilliance separated him further in the Jacket race. Fifteen points on the front, 22 on the back, featuring a remarkable six-hole window from the 10th to 15th averaging just one over par. Meanwhile Mullin, who'd been second in the Trophy standings, collapsed to fourth with 30 points, blow-ups at the 14th and 16th costing him dearly.

**Trophy Standings:** SN 113 | GW 101 | JB 99 | AB 94 | DM 97  
**Green Jacket Standings:** GW +55 | JB +69 | DM +71 | SN +82 | AB +110

## Round 4: Coronation at Estoril {#round-4}

Neumann cruised home with 43 points at Estoril, never threatened as Williams claimed second with 42. A fifth-point birdie at the second set the tone: 18 points from the opening six holes. Even a nine at the eighth—his only zero of the round—couldn't derail the procession.

David Mullin salvaged tournament pride with the week's best Stableford round: 45 points, matching Williams' +11 gross for the day's finest stroke play performance. Back-to-back birdies at the second and seventh showcased his talent, but arriving too late to challenge after his Round 3 collapse. Williams' consistency never wavered: another sub-par performance relative to the field, sealing the Jacket with authority.

Alex Baker's nightmare concluded with the tournament's most horrific moment. The 12th hole, a par four: eleven strokes, seven over par, zero points. It followed blow-ups at the first, third and sixth. Thirteen zero-point holes across 72, just one birdie registered all week. His 29-point margin below fourth place represented the tournament's starkest gap.

**Trophy Standings:** SN 156 | GW 143 | DM 142 | JB 131 | AB 127  
**Green Jacket Standings:** GW +66 | DM +82 | JB +93 | SN +105 | AB +148

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Stuart Neumann's maiden Trophy arrived via the most commanding wire-to-wire performance in recent tournament memory. Leading all 72 holes, his 156-point total crushed Williams by 13 and the wooden spooner by 29. Three career wooden spoons erased in one dominant week.

The split verdict between Trophy and Jacket winners masked their parallel domination. Williams led all 72 holes in the gross competition, his +66 total averaging under a stroke over par per hole. Thirty pars across the tournament, never worse than +22 in any round. Two players, two competitions, identical authority.

Jon Baker's challenge disintegrated at Penha Longa's 12th. A quintuple bogey, followed immediately by a quadruple: from contention to also-ran in two catastrophic holes. Three birdies across the tournament couldn't compensate for nine zero-point holes. David Mullin's 45-point finale showcased what might have been, his Round 4 brilliance arriving too late after dropping from second to fourth at Penha Longa.

Alex Baker's wooden spoon became inevitable after the opening hole's nine. Thirteen zero-pointers followed, including the closing round's +7 horror show at the 12th. Only ten birdies recorded across 360 tournament holes—a 2.8% rate—with 63 triple bogeys telling the tale of Portugal's coastal bite. Neumann's redemption arc complete, three spoons forgotten, wire-to-wire dominance delivered.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy):** Three birdies couldn't salvage a challenge destroyed by nine zero-point holes. Briefly led the Jacket race in Round 2 before fading.
