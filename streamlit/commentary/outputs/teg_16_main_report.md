# TEG 16: Neumann's Maiden Triumph and the Paradox of Williams

Stuart Neumann claimed his first TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance of such serene dominance it made his previous three wooden spoon finishes feel like a bad dream from which he'd finally awoken. Leading all 72 holes, never threatened, never caught, Neumann's 156-point triumph represented the most stable victory margin in tournament history—the golfing equivalent of watching paint dry, if the paint were exceptionally competent and the wall were in Portugal. His 13-point winning margin told only half the story; this was a coronation delayed by three years of basement dwelling, now delivered with the inevitability of a Lisbon sunrise.

But here's where TEG 16 enters the realm of sporting paradox: Gregg Williams won the Green Jacket. Also wire-to-wire. Also never threatened. Also utterly dominant in his domain—finishing 16 strokes clear in gross scoring while posting rounds of +18, +22, +15, and +11. Williams led every single gross hole yet finished second in the Stableford competition that actually mattered, like a footballer who scores a hat-trick in a 4-3 defeat. This marked the first split championship in recent TEG memory, a tournament simultaneously boring in its predictability yet fascinating in its contradictions.

The real drama, such as it was, played out in the lower reaches. Alex Baker collected his third wooden spoon with a 29-point deficit that somehow undersells the carnage—thirteen zero-point holes scattered across four rounds like landmines on a particularly vindictive golf course. His quintuple-bogey on the opening hole of the tournament set the tone; his sextuple-bogey on Round 1's 17th confirmed the theme. Meanwhile, David Mullin saved his best for last, posting a tournament-best 45 points in Round 4—a performance so spectacular it proved utterly meaningless, arriving three rounds too late to matter. Forty-five points in vain: the golfing equivalent of remembering the perfect comeback three hours after the argument.

## Round 1: The Sextuple-Bogey Overture

They began at Oitavos Dunes, that wind-scoured strip of Portuguese coastline where golf balls go to die and handicaps go to be questioned. Stuart Neumann took the Stableford lead on the very first hole with a tidy 3 points, while Alex Baker opened with a quintuple-bogey 9 that would have embarrassed a enthusiastic Labrador. This was Baker's tournament in microcosm: the occasional flash of competence (4 points on the 6th, briefly escaping last place on the 10th) invariably followed by fresh disaster.

The 7th hole delivered wholesale carnage—Baker posted another zero (a 9 on the par-5), while Neumann stumbled to a triple-bogey that merely emphasized how everyone else was doing worse. David Mullin and Jon Baker both found creative ways to make 8 on the par-5 eighth, earning matching zeros. Mullin compounded his misery with a 7 on the par-4 tenth, dropping to fifth in the Stableford standings and questioning his life choices.

But it was the 17th that provided the round's defining moment: Alex Baker's sextuple-bogey 10, a score so comprehensively terrible it deserved its own support group. Neumann also triple-bogeyed the hole—his second of the round—yet still led comfortably. The final hole brought mass capitulation, with everyone except Gregg Williams posting triple-bogeys, as if the course had demanded one final tribute before releasing them.

**After Round 1:** SN: 39pts/+26; GW: 34pts/+18; JB: 34pts/+21; DM: 33pts/+23; AB: 29pts/+42

Neumann led the Stableford by 5 points—comfortable but not commanding. Williams, meanwhile, held the gross lead at +18, with Jon Baker's +21 nearest in pursuit. The battle lines were drawn, even if nobody yet realized this would be a war without a single shot fired in anger.

## Round 2: The Birdie Interlude

Troia, a virgin TEG course, offered hope for fresh narratives. It delivered birdies instead—three of them on the 10th hole alone, as if the gods of golf had temporarily forgotten where they were. Neumann, Jon Baker, and Alex Baker all converted, with Baker briefly ascending from the Stableford depths before gravity reasserted itself on the 11th, dragging him back to last.

Jon Baker enjoyed a brief moment of gross leadership on the 11th—a fleeting reign of glory that lasted all of one hole before Williams reclaimed his throne. Baker regained it on the 14th, lost it again on the 16th, in a back-nine battle that would have been riveting if it weren't happening in an entirely separate competition to the one anyone actually cared about.

Alex Baker's Round 2 was a masterclass in squandered opportunity. His 32 Stableford points looked respectable until you noted his +34 gross score—a handicapped performance suggesting his playing handicap might need its own handicap. Disasters on the 2nd, 4th, and 13th ensured he remained rooted in fifth, while Neumann's own struggles (disasters on the 4th, 13th, 16th, and 17th) somehow left him with 35 points and an extended 7-point lead.

The round's most telling sequence came from holes 14-17, where Neumann hemorrhaged 1 point across four holes while his closest pursuers failed to capitalize. A hot spell from 10-12 (11 points including his birdie) had given Neumann breathing room he wouldn't relinquish. Williams, posting just 30 Stableford points despite his 22 gross strokes, dropped to fourth in the rankings while somehow extending his gross lead—the paradox beginning to crystallize.

**After Round 2:** SN: 74pts/+56; DM: 67pts/+45; JB: 66pts/+44; GW: 64pts/+40; AB: 61pts/+76

Neumann's 7-point cushion looked modest but proved insurmountable. Mullin had surged to second, Jon Baker held third, and Williams sat fourth despite leading the competition that didn't matter. Baker, trailing by 13 points, had already played himself out of contention with his Round 1 demolition derby.

## Round 3: The Twelve-Point Breakaway

Penha Longa, that Estoril mountain track where Neumann had once posted an 82 gross in TEG 8, now witnessed his coronation rehearsal. It began inauspiciously—a disaster on the 1st hole (+4, zero points) that would have derailed lesser leaders. But this was the new Neumann: 39 points despite the wobble, extending his Stableford lead from 7 to 12 in a round that turned comfortable into insurmountable.

Hole 12 delivered coordinated chaos: Jon Baker posted a disaster at +5, Alex Baker contributed +4, both scoring zero points in what became the round's signature moment of collective collapse. The 13th continued the carnage—Baker and Baker again, this time +4 and +3 respectively, another round of zeros. It was disaster golf at its purest, the kind where you wonder if the pin positions were drawn by someone who actively hated golfers.

Gregg Williams provided the round's counterpoint, posting 37 Stableford points on 15-over-par golf that would have won most TEG rounds outright. His back-nine surge (22 points) included a stretch from holes 11-16 where he averaged just +0.17 against par—golf so precise it seemed computer-generated. Yet it earned him merely second place in the Stableford standings, still 12 points behind a leader who'd opened with a disaster and staggered through most of the middle.

David Mullin's 30-point return dropped him to fourth, while Jon Baker's 33 points kept him third. But the tournament was over as competitive spectacle. Neumann had broken away, Williams had confirmed his gross dominance while falling further behind in the only competition that truly mattered, and Alex Baker—despite matching Jon's 33 points—posted a +34 gross that suggested he was playing a different sport entirely.

**After Round 3:** SN: 113pts/+82; GW: 101pts/+55; JB: 99pts/+69; DM: 97pts/+71; AB: 94pts/+110

A 12-point lead with one round to play: the die was cast, the trophy decided, the only question remaining being whether anyone would have the grace to make the final round interesting. Spoiler: they would not.

## Round 4: Mullin's Magnificent Futility

Estoril, the tournament's closing venue, witnessed David Mullin's finest hour—45 Stableford points on 11-over-par golf that would have won any other round of any other TEG. Birdies on the 2nd and 7th anchored the best single-round performance in tournament history. It was also, in competitive terms, utterly meaningless. Mullin finished third overall, 14 points behind the winner, his Round 4 masterpiece serving only to emphasize how thoroughly he'd squandered Rounds 1-3.

Neumann's response was to post 43 points himself, including a birdie on the 2nd and a resilient 18-point opening six holes that absorbed a disaster on the 8th (+5, zero points) without flinching. His 4 points on the 12th—recovering immediately from catastrophe—embodied the serene competence that had defined his week. Never threatened, never caught, never interesting, always winning.

Alex Baker opened with a disaster (+5 on the 1st), followed it with another on the 3rd (+4), added a third on the 6th (+4), then crowned his week with a +7 abomination on the 12th for his fourth zero-point hole of the round. Thirteen disasters across 72 holes—a ratio suggesting he'd mistaken the scorecard for a bingo card and was trying to fill it completely. Yet his back-nine 20 points (against a front-nine 13) showed the player he might have been if the golf gods weren't actively conspiring against him.

Gregg Williams posted 42 points on 11 gross strokes—the joint-best gross performance alongside Mullin—yet it merely confirmed his second-place finish in the Stableford. His disaster on the 14th (+4) was his only blemish in a round of clinical precision, but precision in service of the wrong competition. Jon Baker stumbled to 32 points and fourth place overall, his birdie on the 10th immediately negated by a disaster on the 11th in the kind of momentum swing that defined his tournament.

**Final Standings:** SN: 156pts/+105; GW: 143pts/+66; DM: 142pts/+82; JB: 131pts/+93; AB: 127pts/+148

Neumann won by 13 points, having led for 72 consecutive holes—the most boring chase in TEG history and somehow the most satisfying for a player who'd collected three wooden spoons before discovering what winning felt like. Williams won by 16 strokes, having led for 72 consecutive gross holes—the most dominant performance that didn't win the primary trophy.

## Tournament Recap: Two Winners, One Champion

TEG 16 will be remembered not for its drama—there was none—but for its structural paradox: the best gross player didn't win the tournament, and the tournament winner wasn't the best gross player. Gregg Williams posted rounds of +18, +22, +15, and +11, finishing 16 strokes clear of Mullin in the Green Jacket race while placing second in the Stableford competition by 13 points. It was the golfing equivalent of leading every lap and finishing second.

Stuart Neumann's maiden Trophy win erased three years of wooden spoon finishes with a performance of such mechanical consistency—35, 39, 35, 43 points across four rounds—it bordered on the meditative. Never spectacular, never threatened, never needing to be either. His wire-to-wire coronation offered competitive golf fans absolutely nothing in terms of tension while delivering everything in terms of redemption narrative.

And Alex Baker? His third wooden spoon came wrapped in catastrophe: thirteen zero-point holes, 22 worse-than-double disasters, and a +148 gross score that suggested his handicap might be a work of creative fiction. Yet even Baker managed 33 points in the final round's back nine, a reminder that golf, like hope, springs eternal—usually just after you've completely ruined your scorecard on the front.

The split championship raises questions about handicapped golf's capacity to separate excellence from efficient mediocrity. Williams played the best golf; Neumann played the smartest golf. One went home with a jacket, the other with a trophy, and somewhere in that distinction lies either profound sporting philosophy or complete nonsense. In Lisbon, under those patient Portuguese skies, both men led wire-to-wire in parallel competitions that somehow never intersected. It was the most predictable, least dramatic, and most structurally fascinating TEG in recent memory—which, frankly, is exactly what amateur golf needed after whatever chaos came before.
