## Tournament Summary {#recap}

Jon Baker claimed his fourth Trophy with the most commanding performance in tournament history, leading wire-to-wire in both competitions across the Kentish coastline. His six-point victory over Gregg Williams in the Stableford told only half the story. Baker led all 72 holes in the Gross, and 70 of 72 in the Trophy battle, producing the tournament's only sub-par round along the way.

Williams mounted the week's sole serious challenge, briefly seizing the Trophy lead twice during Round 2's back nine drama before Baker's birdie on the final hole snatched it back on countback. John Patterson provided the weekend's theatre, his tournament-best 49-point explosion in Round 3 vaulting him from fifth to third despite accumulating fourteen blow-ups across the four rounds. The tournament's only eagle—Patterson's opening flourish in Round 4—preceded an immediate triple bogey in classic fashion.

David Mullin's quintuple bogey disaster on the tenth hole of the final round sealed his fourth Wooden Spoon, a catastrophic nine strokes that ended any hope of escaping the bottom position.

## Round 1: Baker Stakes His Claim {#round-1}

Royal Cinque Ports, one of the toughest tests on the Kent coast, provided an unforgiving introduction. Baker announced his intentions immediately, matching par on the opening hole before birdieing the third to seize the Trophy lead. He would not relinquish it for the remainder of the tournament.

Williams' challenge began chaotically. Triple bogeys on the second and third holes left him eight points adrift after three holes, the latter a par five that should have offered birdie opportunities. His recovery came late, a birdie on the fifteenth signalling renewed intent, but Baker's six-point cushion suggested early control. Patterson's round swung between extremes: a birdie on the fifth, then a quintuple bogey on the seventh, followed by another blow-up on the sixteenth. The pattern was established.

Alex Baker endured a nightmare start, triple bogey on the opening hole setting the tone for consecutive disasters on the eleventh and twelfth. Dave Murphy, making his tournament debut, posted 31 points to sit joint-second in the Gross standings alongside Alex Baker, though both trailed Baker's commanding +13 by nine strokes.

Baker's front-nine dominance—23 points to Williams' 12—contrasted sharply with Williams' back-nine surge, 21 points reversing the narrative but arriving too late. The opening salvo: Baker 39 points, Williams 33, Murphy and Alex Baker 31, Patterson 28.

## Round 2: Countback Drama at Prince's {#round-2}

The Dunes and Himalayas combination at Prince's Golf Club set the stage for the tournament's defining drama. Baker's second birdie of the week on the sixth extended his advantage, but Williams' steady play through the middle holes kept the gap manageable. Then the back nine turned electric.

Williams' four-point haul on the fifteenth, a par five where Baker imploded to a triple bogey, flipped the leaderboard. Williams led. Two holes later, Baker had reclaimed it. At the eighteenth tee, Williams edged ahead again on points. Baker's response: a nerveless birdie on the closing par four, his third of the tournament, forcing a countback that saw him retain the lead by the slimmest mathematical margin.

Patterson's round disintegrated. Triple bogeys opened proceedings on the first and third holes, bookending a brief moment of competence. The closing stretch brought three more disasters—fourteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth—leaving him marooned on 28 points for the second consecutive day, now 19 points behind Baker's cumulative 75.

Alex Baker's triple bogey on the tenth cost him momentum. David Mullin's quadruple on the ninth offered a glimpse of what awaited him in the final round. The standings remained tight at the top: Baker 75 points to Williams' 74, with Mullin third on 68.

**Round 2 Standings:**

## Round 3: Patterson's 49-Point Explosion {#round-3}

Littlestone Golf Club, a classic remote links refined by Braid and MacKenzie, witnessed the tournament's statistical highlight. Patterson produced a 49-point masterclass, the best single-round performance of the week, leaping from fifth to third in the Trophy standings despite his +12 gross score ranking only second for the round.

Baker's response was clinical. His 44 points, built around a birdie on the ninth and sustained par golf, came with a +8 gross score—the only sub-par round of the entire tournament. The achievement extended his Trophy lead to five points and cemented his Gross dominance. Patterson's brilliance could not close the gap; Baker's consistency proved insurmountable.

Williams briefly reclaimed the Trophy lead on the opening hole before a triple bogey on the second ended the insurrection. His 40 points kept him second overall, but the margin had widened. Alex Baker's four blow-ups, including triple bogeys on the second, eighth, twelfth, and eighteenth, left him mired in fifth on 97 cumulative points, 22 behind Baker's 119.

Mullin's 32-point effort included a triple bogey on the fourteenth, a warning sign largely ignored. Patterson's round featured a birdie on the fourth and a quadruple on the seventeenth, encapsulating his week's volatility. The leaderboard after three: Baker extending his authority, Patterson surging, Williams holding second, Alex Baker and Mullin fighting to avoid the Spoon.

**Round 3 Standings:**  
**Trophy:** JB 119 | GW 114 | JP 105 | AB 97 | DM 100  
**Jacket:** JB +37 | GW +51 | DM +60 | AB +86 | JP +81

## Round 4: The Tenth Hole Catastrophe {#round-4}

The Shore and Dunes combination at Prince's provided the final act. Patterson opened with the tournament's only eagle, a glorious three on the par-five second. The next hole brought a triple bogey. The man contained multitudes.

Alex Baker's 44 points—matching Baker's Round 3 best—powered his strong finish, three four-point holes on the front nine building momentum. Patterson's eagle euphoria lasted one hole before the collapse resumed: triple bogey on the third, then blow-ups on the twelfth and fifteenth, the latter a quintuple bogey nine. Three zero-point holes in the final round encapsulated his bipolar week.

The tenth hole delivered carnage. Mullin's quintuple bogey—a catastrophic nine strokes, five over par—sealed his fourth Spoon. Baker joined the chaos with his own triple bogey on the same hole, briefly threatening his otherwise serene progress. Alex Baker's four points on the tenth while others floundered lifted him clear of the Spoon danger, the contrast stark and decisive.

Williams closed with 38 points, strong enough to secure second place in both competitions but never threatening Baker's command. Baker's birdie on the seventeenth, his fifth of the tournament, provided a fitting flourish. The final margins: six points in the Trophy, eighteen strokes in the Gross. Wire-to-wire dominance, complete and unassailable.

**Final Standings:**  
**Trophy:** JB 158 | GW 152 | AB 141 | JP 141 | DM 135  
**Jacket:** JB +50 | GW +68 | AB +103 | JP +106 | DM +80

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Jon Baker's fourth Trophy arrived via the most commanding wire-to-wire performance in tournament history. Leading all 72 holes in the Gross and 70 of 72 in the Stableford, his control never truly wavered despite Round 2's countback drama. Five birdies, including the crucial eighteenth-hole reclaim at Prince's, showcased composure under pressure. His Round 3 sub-par gross—the only one across the field all week—underscored the consistency gulf.

Williams' one-hole lead during Round 2's back nine provided fleeting drama before Baker's birdie restored order. The six-point final margin understated Baker's authority; in the Gross, eighteen strokes separated them. Williams' runner-up in both competitions marked a solid week without ever truly threatening.

Patterson's 49-point Round 3 explosion—the tournament's statistical highlight—could not overcome his fourteen blow-ups and standard deviation of 9.91 across four rounds. The eagle-to-triple sequence on Rounds 4's opening holes epitomised his week: brilliance immediately undermined by chaos. His third-place Trophy finish, achieved via countback over Alex Baker despite an inferior Gross score, encapsulated the format's contradictions.

Mullin's quintuple bogey on the final round's tenth hole handed him his fourth Wooden Spoon. A nine on the par four, five over par, erasing any hope of climbing clear. The catastrophe defined his tournament: moments of competence obliterated by singular disasters.

Alex Baker's tournament-best 44-point final round matched his brother's Round 3 effort but arrived too late to challenge for silverware. The family dominance extended only to the winner's podium.
