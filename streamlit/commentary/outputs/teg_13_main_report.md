# TEG 13 Tournament Report: Jon's Hat-Trick and TEG's Third Eagle

Jon Baker claimed both trophies with 158 Stableford points and 69 strokes over par, completing a hat-trick of TEG Trophies and Green Jackets. The 3-point victory over Gregg Williams (155) was Jon's tightest margin yet, but the Gross dominanceâ€”winning by 13 strokesâ€”left no doubt about who controlled the tournament.

Meanwhile, John Patterson holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 4 for eagleâ€”the third eagle in 13 tournaments of TEG history. Patterson now owns two of the three eagles ever scored, making him TEG's unofficial eagle specialist.

And David Mullin collected his third consecutive wooden spoon, extending his post-dynasty nightmare to three years.

## Jon's Double Hat-Trick

One hundred fifty-eight Stableford points across four rounds (37-42-39-40) won Jon his third TEG Trophy by 3 points over Gregg. After trailing by 7 after Round 1, Jon posted 42 points in Round 2 to take the lead and never surrendered it.

The Gross competition was more comfortable: 69 strokes over par, 13 ahead of second place. Jon won Rounds 2, 3, and 4 in Gross while posting steady Stableford scores. Three trophies, three Green Jackets, all earned through grinding consistency.

Jon's Round 2 included a 4-point birdie on Hole 18 (par 4), demonstrating that occasionallyâ€”very occasionallyâ€”Jon could produce moments of actual excellence rather than just grinding competence.

## Patterson's Second Eagle

Hole 2, Round 4, Portugal. John Patterson holed his second shot on a par 5 for eagleâ€”two under par, 5 Stableford points, the third eagle in TEG history.

This was Patterson's second eagle. He'd scored the first at TEG 4 (par 4, Hole 8), then waited nine tournaments to score another. With Jon Baker's TEG 4 eagle and Stuart Neumann's TEG 12 eagle, only three eagles had been scored across 936 holes (13 tournaments). Patterson owned two of them.

The eagle came in Round 4 when Patterson was in fifth place and the tournament was decided. Like Stu's TEG 12 eagle, it arrived too late to matter competitively but early enough to secure history.

Patterson finished fifth with 131 points. That eagle on Hole 2 counted for 5 Stableford points and confirmed Patterson as TEG's eagle king.

## Dave's Third Wooden Spoon

David Mullin finished last for the third consecutive year with 132 Stableford points, one point ahead of Patterson. Three wooden spoons after nine Green Jackets. The dynasty was dead, and the decline was sustained.

The small consolation: Dave won Round 3 in Gross (his first round victory since TEG 11), suggesting muscle memory occasionally resurfaces. But he still finished third in Gross overall, 13 strokes behind Jon, never threatening the championship.

Three consecutive wooden spoons. After nine years of dominance, Dave had spent three years finishing last. Golf giveth, golf taketh away, golf occasionally grinds you into dust.

## Gregg's Close Runner-Up

Gregg Williams posted 155 Stableford points and finished 3 points behind Jonâ€”his closest brush with victory since TEG 7. Led after Round 1 with 44 points, then watched Jon take control in Round 2 and maintain it through the finish.

Gregg never won a round. Never seriously threatened Jon after Round 2. Spent four days being very good while Jon was being slightly better. Runner-up by 3 points with a score that would've won some tournaments. Not this one.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Gregg's 44 leads by 7 over Jon (37), Alex 33, Dave/Patterson tied 31, Henry 28

**Round 2:** Jon's 42 (plus 4-point hole H18) takes lead (79 total), Gregg 77, Alex 69, Patterson 66, Dave 65, Henry 59

**Round 3:** Jon 118 (extends to +4), Gregg 114, Alex 103, Patterson 98, Dave 97 (wins Gross round!), Henry 89

**Round 4:** Jon 158 (seals double by 3), Gregg 155, Alex 139, Dave 132 (3rd WS), Patterson 131 (EAGLE H2!), Henry 121

## The Verdict

Jon Baker's hat-trick of trophies and jackets was earned through steady accumulation and a tight 3-point victory over Gregg. One hundred fifty-eight Stableford points won the Trophy; 69 strokes over par (13 ahead of second) won the jacket. Jon's third double in dominant fashion.

Patterson's eagleâ€”the third in TEG history, his second personallyâ€”made him TEG's eagle specialist with two of three ever scored. Hole 2, Round 4, par 5, holed from the fairway. History made while finishing fifth.

Dave's third consecutive wooden spoon (132 points, one ahead of Patterson) confirmed the dynasty was thoroughly extinguished. Gregg's runner-up (155 points, led after R1) was his closest finish in six years.

Alex's fourth place (139 points) and Henry's sixth (121 points) completed the field.
