# TEG 13 - Player Profiles

---

## Jon BAKER - 1st (Stableford: 158 pts) | 1st (Gross: 69 strokes, **3rd Green Jacket**)

Jon Baker completed the hat-trick: three TEG Trophies, three Green Jackets, three double victories. One hundred fifty-eight Stableford points won by 3 over Greggâ€”Jon's tightest margin yetâ€”while 69 strokes over par won gross by 13. Sometimes dominance needs drama (Stableford), sometimes it doesn't (Gross).

**The Comeback:** Trailed Gregg by 7 after Round 1 (37 to Gregg's 44). Then posted 42 points in Round 2 to take the lead. Never surrendered it. Classic Jonâ€”start slow, finish relentless.

**The 4-Point Hole:** Round 2, Hole 18, par 4. Jon holed a birdie worth 4 Stableford points, demonstrating that occasionally he could produce excellence rather than just grinding competence. That 4-pointer helped build his Round 2 lead.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd (Stableford: 155 pts, +3) | 4th (Gross: 89 strokes, +20)

Gregg Williams posted 155 Stableford pointsâ€”his closest brush with victory in six yearsâ€”and still finished 3 points behind Jon. Led after Round 1, then watched Jon take control and never look back. This is becoming Gregg's signature: lead early, lose late.

**The Strong Start:** Forty-four points in Round 1 built a 7-point lead over Jon. Gregg looked dominant, comfortable, destined for victory. Then Jon posted 42 in Round 2, and Gregg's lead evaporated into "briefly competitive."

**The Rounds:** 44-33-37-41. Started brilliantly, faded in Round 2 (33 points while Jon posted 42), recovered in Rounds 3-4 but never caught Jon. The scoring pattern of someone who peaked too early.

## John PATTERSON - 5th (Stableford: 131 pts, +27) | 5th (Gross: 109 strokes, +40)

John Patterson holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 4 for eagleâ€”the third eagle in 13 tournaments of TEG history and Patterson's second. With only three eagles ever scored, Patterson owns two of them, making him TEG's unofficial eagle king.

**The Eagle:** Hole 2, Round 4, Portugal. Par 5. Patterson holed his second shot for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. His second eagle after TEG 4 (par 4, Hole 8). Nine tournaments between eagles, then boomâ€”history made again.

**TEG's Eagle King:** Three eagles total in 13 tournaments (936 holes). Patterson has two. Jon Baker has one. StuartNeumann has one. Patterson is the only player to score multiple eagles, making him TEG's most exclusive club's most exclusive member.

## Alex BAKER - 4th (Stableford: 139 pts, +19) | 6th (Gross: 110 strokes, +41)

Alex Baker finished fourth with 139 Stableford points, which is perfectly respectable and utterly forgettable when Jon's winning hat-tricks and Patterson's scoring eagles.

**The Rounds:** 33-36-34-36. Consistent mediocrity across four rounds. Alex never threatened, never collapsed, never did anything worth remembering. Fourth place secured through professional competence and nothing more.

**One Birdie:** Alex found exactly one birdie across 72 holes, suggesting birdies are theoretical concepts he's aware of but not particularly committed to executing.

## David MULLIN - 6th (**3rd consecutive Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 132 pts, +26) | 3rd (Gross: 82 strokes, +13)

David Mullin collected his third consecutive wooden spoon with 132 Stableford points, one point ahead of Patterson. After nine Green Jackets, David had now finished last three years running. The dynasty was dead, and the decline had achieved permanence.

**Triple Spoons:** TEG 11: wooden spoon (125 pts). TEG 12: wooden spoon (139 pts). TEG 13: wooden spoon (132 pts). David has perfected the art of finishing last with gradually varying levels of mediocrity.

**The Small Victory:** Won Round 3 in grossâ€”David's first round victory since TEG 11. Muscle memory occasionally resurfaces, suggesting the former champion still exists somewhere beneath the wooden spoon collector.

---

## Henry MELLER - 6th (tied with David, Stableford: 121 pts, +37) | 2nd (Gross: 82 strokes, +13, tied with David)

Henry Meller returned to TEG after missing several tournaments and promptly finished sixth with 121 points, tied with David in gross but mercifully not awarded the wooden spoon due to tiebreak rules.

**The Comeback:** First TEG since... actually, who remembers? Henry showed up, posted 121 points, finished last (or second-to-last depending on tiebreaks), proved he hadn't improved during his absence.

**The Rounds:** 28-31-30-32. Metronomically mediocre from start to finish. Henry treated consistency like a virtue, forgetting that being consistently bad is still bad.
