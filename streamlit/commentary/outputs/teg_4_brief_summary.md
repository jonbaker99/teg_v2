David Mullin claimed both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket with a commanding wire-to-wire gross performance and a dramatic come-from-behind Stableford victory. Despite trailing Jon Baker by one point heading into the final round, Mullin seized control on hole 14 after Baker's catastrophic implosion—two sextuple bogeys or worse on holes 12 and 15—to win the Trophy by three points with 137 points. His +81 gross total represented absolute dominance from the opening hole, leading all 72 holes en route to his second Trophy and third Green Jacket.

Baker's collapse ranks among the most heartbreaking in TEG history. After leading the Stableford for 49 of 72 holes and carding an eagle on Round 4's eighth hole, he imploded on the back nine with just nine points across nine holes. His sextuple bogey disasters on the 12th and 15th turned a comfortable lead into runner-up finish, ending at 134 points. Henry Meller recovered from a Round 1 quintuple bogey to tie for the lead after 36 holes, ultimately claiming third place with 121 points despite recording 16 zero-point holes across the tournament.

Gregg Williams collected his maiden Wooden Spoon, finishing 27 points behind Mullin after never recovering from a Round 1 back-nine collapse. His 14 zero-point holes and 28 worse-than-double-bogeys told the story of a tournament defined by chaos—52 collective triple bogeys or worse included mass disaster zones on holes 10 (Round 3) and 15 (Rounds 3-4), where the field hemorrhaged strokes and momentum shifted dramatically.
