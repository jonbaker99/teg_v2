# TEG 4 Tournament Report: Dave's Double and TEG's First Eagle

Ashdown Forest Golf Club had never witnessed TEG before, but by the time Dave Mullin departed with both trophies, the course had been thoroughly introduced to the northern Lancastrian's brand of grinding, relentless, mistake-minimizing golf. One hundred thirty-seven Stableford points and a 4-stroke gross victory told the same story: when Dave is on form, everyone else is playing for the minor placings.

This was Dave's second TEG Trophy and third consecutive Green Jacket, achieved by briefly surrendering the lead to Jon Baker in Round 2, then calmly reclaiming it when it actually mattered. Defending champion Jon learned the hard way: defending titles is significantly harder than winning them the first time.

But TEG 4 will be remembered for more than Dave's dominance. On the 8th hole of the final round, Jon Baker holed a par 4 for eagle—the first eagle in TEG history. It counted for 5 Stableford points. It wasn't enough to save his title, but it was history nonetheless.

## The Mid-Tournament Drama

TEG 4's story was simple: Dave and Jon started tied after Round 1 (both 33 points), Jon took control in Round 2 with a brilliant 37-pointer, then Dave struck back in Rounds 3 and 4 to claim both trophies by 5 points.

Jon's Round 2 surge—37 Stableford points that built a 4-point lead—briefly suggested the defending champion might retain his crown. Then Round 3 arrived, Dave posted 36 points to Jon's 34, and suddenly the momentum had shifted. The final round was a formality: Dave's 34 points sealed it while Jon's 33 couldn't close the gap.

The gross competition told a different story: Dave led from wire to wire, extending his advantage each round until he won by 4 strokes. Two competitions, one dominant Dave.

## Gregg's Wooden Spoon Debut

Gregg Williams collected his first wooden spoon with 114 points and nine triple bogeys across four rounds. Nine. That's not bad luck; that's a commitment to disaster that deserves its own award.

Round 1: Four triple bogeys. Round 2: Five triple bogeys. By Round 3, Gregg had presumably run out of ways to implode and settled for merely mediocre golf (30-31 points in the final two rounds). Too little, too late. The wooden spoon was his, earned through dedication to catastrophe.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Dave/Jon tied 33 (both 1 triple each), Henry 30, Stu 27, Gregg 24 (4 triples = instant trouble)

**Round 2:** Jon 37 (leads by 4!), Dave 34, Henry 36 (3 birdies!), Stu 33, Gregg 29 (5 more triples = 9 total)

**Round 3:** Dave 36 (reclaims lead by 2), Jon 34, Henry/Stu/Gregg all 30-31

**Round 4:** Dave 34 (wins by 5), Jon 33 including THE FIRST EVER TEG EAGLE on Hole 8 (par 4), Henry 35, Stu/Gregg 31 each

## The Historic Eagle

Hole 8, Round 4, Bletchingley Golf Club. Jon Baker, already trailing Dave by 2 points heading into the final round, stepped up to a par 4 and made eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. The first eagle in TEG history.

It arrived too late to save Jon's title—Dave was already pulling away—but it marked a moment. Eagles would remain extraordinarily rare in TEG (only four have been scored across 17 tournaments), making Jon's achievement at Bletchingley a genuine piece of history. Sometimes you lose the war but win a battle worth remembering.

## The Verdict

Dave Mullin's fourth trophy in three tournaments was achieved through his trademark formula: be boring, be consistent, be champion. Jon discovered that defending titles requires the same relentless grinding that won them in the first place—and Dave simply does it better.

But Jon will always have this: the first eagle in TEG history, holed on a par 4 in the final round when he was already beaten. It's the kind of consolation prize that actually matters.

Henry's bronze (132 points) featured four birdies but couldn't threaten the top two. Stu's fourth (121) was professional but forgettable. And Gregg's wooden spoon (114 points, 9 triple bogeys) was earned through sheer commitment to finding new ways to implode.

Ashdown Forest had hosted its first TEG. Dave had claimed his second consecutive double. The northern dominance continued, relentless as ever.
