## At-a-Glance {#at-a-glance}

**Trophy Winner:** David Mullin (2nd Trophy)  
**Jacket Winner:** David Mullin (3rd Jacket)  
**Wooden Spoon:** Gregg Williams (1st Spoon)

---

David Mullin claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket with a commanding wire-to-wire performance across England's inaugural TEG venues. Leading the Gross standings through all four rounds and converting his Stableford advantage twice, Mullin sealed the sweep with a steady 36-point final round while his rivals imploded around him.

Jon Baker mounted the tournament's most serious challenge, leading the Trophy for 49 of 72 holes. But a catastrophic Round 4 back-nine collapse featuring a 9 at the 12th and an 11 at the 15th saw him surrender a six-point advantage. His eagle at the eighth merely heightened the subsequent agony, as he finished three points adrift.

Gregg Williams endured a historic nightmare, claiming his first career Wooden Spoon with a 27-point Trophy deficit and 71-stroke Gross margin. His tournament bottomed out during Round 3's middle stretch, where three consecutive blow-ups left him firmly anchored to the bottom. Just seven birdies across 360 holes told the story of a brutal week of attrition.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos on Ashdown's Bunkerless Heath {#round-1}

The tournament erupted into life on Royal Ashdown Forest's unique bunkerless layout, where Gregg Williams seized both competitions simultaneously at the opening hole. His birdie at the eighth extended the advantage before the heathland exacted its toll. Williams bled points down the stretch, whilst Jon Baker surged past with steady play and a crucial par at the 15th to claim a four-point Trophy lead.

David Mullin quietly positioned himself just three strokes behind in the Gross standings despite trailing by four points in the Stableford. His birdies at the 10th and 13th provided the foundation for what would become unwavering Gross authority. Henry Meller's round contained both extremes. A catastrophic 12 at the par-3 11th obliterated any early momentum.

Stuart Neumann's promising start, matching Williams hole-for-hole through the front nine, crumbled spectacularly. Blow-ups at the 11th and 18th saw him surrender the Trophy lead he'd briefly held. Baker's own horror show at the 14th, where he carded a 9, merely emphasised the survival mentality required on Ashdown's exposed terrain.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 35 | DM 31 | GW 29 | HM 28 | SN 28  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +23 | JB +26 | SN +28 | HM +32 | GW +36

## Round 2: Lingfield's Lone Birdie Amid Collective Struggle {#round-2}

Jon Baker produced the round's only birdie, a moment of isolated brilliance at the third that stood alone across 18 holes of brutal attrition. It proved insufficient. A late blow-up at the 17th, where Baker carded a 9, cost him the Trophy lead as David Mullin and Henry Meller emerged as co-leaders.

Mullin maintained his Gross stranglehold despite consecutive disasters at the 17th and 18th, wobbles that briefly threatened his dominance. Three consecutive pars through holes two to four steadied the ship. Meller's 36-point round represented the tournament's finest Stableford performance, vaulting him from fourth to joint-first despite his mediocre Gross position.

Williams' misery deepened on Lingfield's mature parkland. Blow-ups at the third, eighth, and ninth left him marooned in fifth place, though his back-nine recovery of 18 points offered faint hope. Stuart Neumann's opening disasters at the first and second saw him plummet to last place in the Spoon battle, consecutive blow-ups yielding just six points across the opening six holes.

Baker's closing stretch collapse, failing to register a point on the 14th before the 17th calamity, encapsulated the round's grinding nature. The 35-hole birdie drought that would follow had already begun to strangle momentum.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 64 | HM 64 | JB 63 | GW 60 | SN 56  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +47 | JB +51 | SN +57 | HM +62 | GW +71

## Round 3: Simultaneous Implosions on Crowborough's Heights {#round-3}

Four players suffered identical blow-ups at the 10th. Henry Meller, Jon Baker, and Stuart Neumann all carded 8s on the par-5, failing to register points as David Mullin's 5 briefly restored his Trophy lead. The carnage repeated at the 15th, where Williams, Meller, Baker, and Neumann again recorded zeros in a surreal display of collective collapse.

Williams hit absolute bottom during this MacKenzie-designed nightmare. Three consecutive blow-ups at the fourth, fifth, and 11th yielded a solitary point across six holes, cementing his grip on the Wooden Spoon. His exit from the bottom at the 18th came via the smallest of mercies, a single point salvaged whilst others around him imploded.

Baker reclaimed the Trophy lead at the second after Meller's opening blow-up, only to watch Mullin seize it back at the 10th before losing it again at the 11th. The lead changed hands three times in 11 holes. Stuart Neumann's birdie at the fifth, the round's lone moment of genuine quality, briefly lifted spirits before the 10th hole massacre.

Mullin's wire-to-wire Gross authority never wavered, his worst moment a closing blow-up at the 18th that barely dented his advantage. Baker's 39-point round gave him a slender one-point Trophy lead entering the final day, six points ahead of Mullin. The stage was set for Sunday's denouement.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 102 | DM 101 | HM 87 | SN 88 | GW 87  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +64 | SN +80 | JB +82 | HM +93 | GW +109

## Round 4: Eagle High and Catastrophic Lows at Bletchingley {#round-4}

Jon Baker's eagle at the eighth, struck from two strokes on the par-4, represented the tournament's only eagle. His birdie at the second had already extended his Trophy advantage. For eight glorious holes, the title seemed his. Then Bletchingley's undulating terrain exacted brutal revenge.

A 9 at the par-3 12th bled crucial points. The 11 at the par-5 15th proved terminal. Twelve strokes over par across just two holes obliterated Baker's challenge as David Mullin seized back the Trophy lead at the 14th. The eagle-to-disaster arc defined Baker's tournament: leading for 49 holes, yet finishing three points behind.

Mullin's 36-point final round, matching his total from Ashdown, sealed the sweep with characteristic steadiness. Three consecutive pars from the fourth through sixth demonstrated the control that had underpinned his Gross dominance throughout. He led 64 of 72 Gross holes, never trailing once.

Gregg Williams saved his worst for last. A career-nadir 23-point, 43-stroke round featured blow-ups at the fifth, sixth, 13th and 14th. The 27-point Trophy margin and 71-stroke Gross deficit represented historic futility. Henry Meller's back-to-back disasters at the 11th and 15th, both 10s, mirrored Baker's collapse but from a less elevated position.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 137 | JB 134 | HM 121 | SN 120 | GW 110  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +81 | HM +107 | JB +113 | SN +100 | GW +152

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

David Mullin's fourth TEG title arrived via the most emphatic Gross dominance in recent memory: leading through every checkpoint, challenged substantively just twice across 72 holes, his authority absolute. Converting that into Stableford success required resilience as the Trophy lead changed hands repeatedly. But when Jon Baker imploded on Bletchingley's back nine, Mullin's steady 36-point round proved sufficient for the sweep.

Baker's heartbreak defined the tournament's narrative as sharply as Mullin's triumph. Leading for 49 of 72 Trophy holes, his six-point advantage entering Round 4 should have been decisive. The eagle at the eighth briefly suggested coronation. Instead, 21 strokes over par from the ninth through 17th, including those catastrophic 9 and 11, turned victory into a three-point defeat. Eleven blow-ups across the week, yet he never led the Gross standings once.

Gregg Williams' first career Wooden Spoon arrived with historic margins: 27 points in the Trophy, 71 strokes in the Jacket. His tournament bottomed out during Round 3's middle holes, three consecutive blow-ups yielding one point across six holes. The 23-point final round represented a career nadir. Of his 72 holes, 28 yielded worse than double-bogey.

The tournament's brutal arithmetic told its own story: just seven birdies across 360 holes, a 35-hole birdie drought spanning from Round 2's fourth to Round 4's second. Baker's eagle stood utterly alone. Henry Meller's volatility saw him co-lead after Round 2 before consecutive 10s in Round 4 dropped him to third. Stuart Neumann's consistency, never leading after a round but never far behind, earned fourth place ahead of Williams by 10 points.

## Player-by-Player Summary {#player-summary}

**David Mullin (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket with wire-to-wire Gross dominance, leading 64 of 72 holes and never trailing once. Converted Stableford leads twice to seal the sweep, his steady 36-point final round sufficient as rivals imploded. Two birdies and 22 pars across the week demonstrated the consistency that underpinned both titles.

**Jon Baker (2nd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Led the Trophy for 49 of 72 holes but surrendered a six-point final-round advantage in catastrophic fashion. His eagle at the eighth proved a false dawn before blow-ups at the 12th (9 strokes) and 15th (11) obliterated his challenge. Finished three points behind Mullin despite 11 total blow-ups across the week, never once leading the Gross standings.

**Henry Meller (3rd Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Co-led after Round 2 with the tournament's best Stableford round (36 points) but couldn't sustain the challenge. Opened with a 12 at the par-3 11th in Round 1, closed with back-to-back 10s in Round 4. The volatility cost him dearly, though his second-place Jacket finish salvaged some dignity.

**Stuart Neumann (4th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** The tournament's most consistent performer, his standard deviations of 2.31 (Trophy) and 2.94 (Gross) reflected steady competence throughout. Never led after a round but never far behind, his lone birdie at Round 3's fifth representing a rare moment of quality amid grinding survival. Finished 14 points clear of the Wooden Spoon.

**Gregg Williams (5th Trophy, 5th Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Endured a historic nightmare in claiming his first career Wooden Spoon, finishing 27 points behind in the Trophy and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket.

Of 72 holes played, 28 yielded worse than double-bogey.
