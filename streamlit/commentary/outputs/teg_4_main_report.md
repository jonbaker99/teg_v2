# TEG 4: Mullin's Wire-to-Wire Masterclass Ends Baker's 49-Hole Dream

## Tournament Summary

David Mullin claimed his second TEG Trophy and third Green Jacket with a performance of brutal efficiency, sweeping both competitions after 72 holes of high-stakes carnage across East Sussex. His 137 points and wire-to-wire gross domination (+81 over four rounds) eventually overwhelmed Jon Baker's heartbreaking collapse in the final nine holes, securing the Stableford title by a mere three points while never relinquishing his stranglehold on the Gross competition.

Baker's tournament will haunt him. After leading the Stableford for 49 of 72 holes—a dominance that promised glory through three and a half rounds—he imploded spectacularly on the final back nine, recording two sextuple bogeys or worse at holes 12 and 15 that transformed certain victory into agonizing defeat. His 9-point back nine was a statistical horror show, erasing a lead that had survived Round 3's mass disaster on hole 10 and seemed impregnable after an eagle on the 8th. The cruelty was exquisite: Baker finished second in both competitions (134 points, +113 gross), close enough to taste triumph, far enough to choke on the bitter residue of what might have been.

Henry Meller's resilience provided the tournament's subplot of redemption. After opening Round 1 with a triple bogey on the first hole and suffering a quintuple bogey disaster on the 11th, he somehow rallied to tie Mullin for the Stableford lead after 36 holes. His 36-point second round—the tournament's best—showcased remarkable mental fortitude, and though he eventually settled for third place (121 points, +107), he'd proven that survival, not brilliance, often defines TEG glory. Stuart Neumann's steady accumulation (120 points, +100) earned him second in the Green Jacket despite finishing fourth in Stableford, underlining this handicapped tournament's delicious paradoxes.

And then there was Gregg Williams, whose maiden Wooden Spoon arrived with grim inevitability after a Round 1 collapse he never escaped. Finishing 27 points behind Mullin with 14 zero-point holes and a record 28 worse-than-double-bogeys, Williams spent all 72 holes in last place, his tournament defined by two separate back-nine implosions and disasters so frequent they became almost routine. The tournament statistics paint a picture of collective chaos—52 triple bogeys or worse, mass extinction events on holes 10 and 15, and lead changes that suggested nobody truly wanted the burden of being in front. In the end, though, it was Mullin's relentless consistency against Baker's catastrophic vulnerability that told the story: sometimes the TEG Trophy isn't won so much as simply not thrown away.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Williams's False Dawn at Ashdown

The tournament opened at Ashdown with Gregg Williams seizing both gross and Stableford leads after a four-point par on the opening hole—a bright start that would curdle into disaster before the back nine even began. Henry Meller's triple bogey on that same first hole dropped him immediately into Spoon territory, establishing early that this East Sussex debut would offer no mercy.

Williams's grip on proceedings lasted precisely three holes. His disaster at the 4th (+4) surrendered the Stableford lead, and by the time the carnage at hole 5 finished—where Darren Mitchell, Meller, and Stuart Neumann all recorded triple bogeys or worse—the tournament had descended into survival mode. Williams contributed a birdie at the 8th (5 points) and Mitchell answered with back-to-back birdies at the 10th and 13th, but the defining moment came at hole 11, where Meller suffered a quintuple bogey or worse (+9) that would have broken lesser mortals. Neumann's disaster at the same hole (+4) merely added to the mounting body count.

Jon Baker, quietly navigating the chaos with a quintuple bogey of his own at the 14th, somehow seized the Stableford lead by hole 15 and held on through the finish. His 35 points gave him a four-point cushion, but it was Mullin's 31 points paired with his tournament-best +23 gross that told the real story. Williams's promising 19-point front nine collapsed into a 10-point back nine horror show—disasters at holes 13-18 yielding just 6 points—and he'd finish third in Stableford despite his early heroics.

Round 1 scores: JB 35pts/+26; DM 31pts/+23; GW 29pts/+36; SN 28pts/+28; HM 28pts/+32

### Round 2: The Chaos Waltz at Lingfield

Baker arrived at Lingfield Park with a four-point lead and extended it immediately, his birdie at the 3rd (5 points) promising dominance. But this was TEG, where early comfort is merely prelude to suffering. Gregg Williams and Henry Meller both encountered disaster at that same 3rd hole—Williams recording +5, Meller +4—setting the stage for a round of relentless lead changes.

Mullin took the Stableford lead at hole 11, lost it immediately at the 12th (where Meller suffered a +3 disaster), then reclaimed it at hole 14 as Baker's own disaster (+3) undid his early advantage. The back nine became a war of attrition: Baker's quintuple bogey at the 17th (+5) looked terminal, but Mullin answered with his own disaster at that same hole (+3), then compounded it with a +4 catastrophe at the 18th. Meller, somehow, grabbed the lead on the final hole to finish tied with Mullin at 68 points after 36 holes.

The round statistics revealed Williams's schizophrenia—13 points on the front nine became 18 on the back—and the collective toll: six triple bogeys or worse for Williams alone, most in the round. Baker had dropped from first to third (63 points total), four behind the tied leaders, but his tournament wasn't yet lost. Neumann's 28 points (fifth in the round) kept him within touching distance, while Williams's 31 points maintained fourth place overall despite his gross score ballooning to +71 for 36 holes.

Round 2 scores: HM 36pts/+20; DM 33pts/+22; GW 31pts/+35; SN 28pts/+27; JB 28pts/+33

### Round 3: Mass Extinction at Crowborough

If the first two rounds had been chaotic, Round 3 at Crowborough descended into apocalyptic farce. Baker reclaimed the Stableford lead at hole 2 with a simple 3 points, exploiting Mullin's lost composure. Williams, meanwhile, recorded an 8 gross (0 points) at that same hole, foreshadowing horrors to come. Neumann's birdie at the 5th (4 points) briefly suggested someone might emerge unscathed, but hole 10 had other ideas.

Hole 10 became a mass grave. Baker, Neumann, and Meller all recorded 8 gross (0 points)—triple bogeys or worse that obliterated momentum and sent their Stableford totals plummeting. Only Mullin (3 points) and Williams (4 points) survived, with Mullin seizing the Stableford lead. He'd surrender it at hole 11, where Williams recorded a 7 gross disaster and Neumann added another 8 gross catastrophe, but Baker fought back with 4 points at the 12th to keep himself in the hunt.

Then came hole 15, a disaster zone so comprehensive it deserves its own memorial plaque. Every player except Mullin recorded triple bogeys or worse: Williams and Baker both suffered 8 gross meltdowns, Meller and Neumann 7 gross disasters. The carnage continued to the 18th, where Baker (8 gross, 0 points), Mullin (7 gross, 0 points), and Meller (7 gross, 0 points) all collapsed. Williams's 7 gross (1 point) somehow lifted him from the Spoon, if only temporarily.

Baker's 39 points won the round and gave him a one-point Stableford lead over Mullin heading into the finale (107 to 106). His strong front nine (22 points) had overcome his back nine struggles (17 points), but the warning signs were flashing red. Mullin's 37-point round included his +17 gross—joint best with his Round 2—extending his wire-to-wire gross domination to 54 holes. Neumann's 32 points kept him third overall, while Meller's 23-point disaster dropped him to fourth despite his 15-point front nine. Williams's 10-point front nine and 17-point back nine left him firmly anchored in last.

Round 3 scores: JB 39pts/+21; DM 37pts/+17; SN 32pts/+23; GW 27pts/+38; HM 23pts/+31

### Round 4: The Final-Nine Massacre at Bletchingley

Baker stood one point ahead on the final tee at Bletchingley, 71 holes into his coronation. The narrative demanded a nervous finish, a grinding battle where experience and nerve would determine the champion. Instead, we got one of the most spectacular collapses in TEG history.

The front nine suggested Baker might actually hold on. His eagle at the 8th—just the tournament's second eagle of four rounds—extended his lead with 5 glorious points and seemed to settle any lingering doubt. Even his disaster at the 10th (0 points) didn't panic him; Mullin suffered his own disaster at that same hole, and everyone knows the back nine is where champions are forged.

Except Baker wasn't forged. He was obliterated. The sextuple bogey or worse at hole 12 (0 points) was catastrophic enough, draining his lead and his confidence. But hole 14's disaster handed Mullin the Stableford lead, and then came hole 15—another sextuple bogey or worse (0 points), part of a nine-point back nine that transformed certain glory into mathematical elimination. Two sextuple bogeys in four holes. Zero points from holes 12 and 15. A lead that had survived 49 holes evaporated in 20 minutes of golf so horrifying it defied comprehension.

Mullin, who had led the gross competition for all 72 holes without flinching, needed only to avoid disaster himself. His 36-point final round wasn't spectacular, but it was utterly sufficient. His second-round and third-round gross scores (+17 each) stood as tournament bests, and his consistency under pressure revealed a champion's temperament. Meller's 34-point final round lifted him to second (121 points total), while Baker's 32 points left him tied third with Neumann in Stableford but second in gross—close enough in both competitions to amplify the agony.

Williams, bless him, recorded a 23-point disaster to finish 27 points behind Mullin with his maiden Wooden Spoon secure. His Round 4 disasters at holes 5, 6, 13, and 14 were almost sympathetic after 54 holes of prior suffering. His 43.0 gross—a personal and all-time TEG worst—completed the humiliation.

Round 4 scores: DM 36pts/+23; HM 34pts/+24; JB 32pts/+33; SN 32pts/+22; GW 23pts/+43

## Tournament Recap

This fourth edition of TEG will be remembered not for what was won but for what was lost—Jon Baker's 49-hole lead dissolving into the East Sussex afternoon like morning mist, leaving only the acrid smell of two sextuple bogeys and a final-nine capitulation so complete it bordered on parody. David Mullin's victory was clinical, dominant in the gross competition from first hole to last, and ultimately decisive in Stableford when Baker's nerve failed spectacularly. His second Trophy and third Green Jacket place him among TEG's elite, though even he might admit the door was opened by catastrophe rather than kicked down by brilliance.

The East Sussex experiment delivered chaos in industrial quantities: 52 triple bogeys or worse, mass disasters on holes 10 and 15 that wiped out entire leaderboards, and lead changes so frequent they threatened to induce whiplash. Henry Meller's resilience—recovering from Round 1's quintuple bogey to tie for the lead after 36 holes—and Gregg Williams's comprehensive disintegration (14 zero-point holes, 28 worse-than-double-bogeys, 43.0 gross) provided the narrative bookends to Mullin's wire-to-wire masterclass and Baker's psychological immolation.

In the end, TEG 4 proved that in golf, as in life, the trophy belongs not always to the talented or the brave, but to those who manage to implode less spectacularly than everyone else. Mullin managed that feat across four rounds and four courses, surviving the carnage with grim efficiency while his rivals discovered new and creative methods of self-destruction. Baker will return, haunted by what might have been. Williams will return, hoping merely to escape the Spoon. And Mullin will return as defending champion, knowing full well that in this beautiful, brutal format, 49 holes in the lead means precisely nothing when the golf gods decide it's time for your reckoning.
