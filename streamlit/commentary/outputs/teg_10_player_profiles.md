# TEG 10 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 10*

---

## Alex BAKER - "The One-Hit Wonder"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 184 pts, **ALL-TIME RECORD**) | 4th (Gross: 90 strokes, +39)
**Historic Achievement:** Highest Stableford score in TEG history (to date)

### The Review

Alex Baker posted 184 Stableford points—the highest score in TEG history through ten tournaments—to win his only career TEG Trophy. That's right: ONLY. Alex peaked at TEG 10, collected his trophy, then spent the next seven tournaments proving it was an anomaly.

**The Scoring:** 42-42-49-51. Consistent brilliance building to a crescendo. The 51-point finale was the second-best single round ever recorded. Alex dismantled Praia D'El Rey with the ruthless efficiency of someone who'd been taking notes for eight tournaments and finally decided to show off.

**The Wire-to-Wire That Wasn't:** Alex didn't lead after Round 1 (Gregg did). Didn't lead after Round 2 (Dave did). Took the lead in Round 3 by one point, then destroyed everyone in Round 4 by seven points. Sometimes you don't need to lead wire-to-wire when you can just obliterate the field when it matters.

**The One Birdie:** Alex managed one birdie across four rounds. ONE. He won the tournament with 184 points and a single birdie. This is Stableford golf distilled to its essence—you don't need to be brilliant, just consistent enough that everyone else's disasters add up slower than yours.

**Historical Context:** The highest score ever. Personal best. Only trophy. The kind of peak performance that defines a career, assuming you never reach those heights again (he didn't).

**Signature Moment:** That 51-point finale. When your best round ever wins you your only trophy, that's how you want to go out.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex proved that occasionally—very occasionally—he could play golf at an elite level. Then he spent the rest of his career proving TEG 10 was a statistical outlier. One tournament, one trophy, one moment of absolute dominance. Some players peak early. Alex peaked at his eighth tournament, which is... actually pretty good timing.

**Rating:** 10/10 for this tournament. 10/10 for that 184-point record. 3/10 for ever repeating it.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Nearly Man Returns"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 173 pts, +11) | 3rd (Gross: 76 strokes, +25)

### The Review

Gregg Williams posted the second-best score in TEG history (173 points) and still finished 11 behind the winner. This is golf's version of running a personal best marathon and finishing second to someone who just broke the world record.

**The Rounds:** 48-45-42-38. Gregg started magnificently, then gradually faded like someone running out of enthusiasm. Led after Round 1 with 48 points—his best-ever opening round—then watched Alex remember he could play golf.

**The Birdie Situation:** Four birdies across four rounds. Enough to challenge, not enough to win. Gregg treated birdies like limited edition collectibles—acquire them occasionally, treasure them, don't get greedy.

**The Reality:** 173 points would've won most tournaments. At TEG 10, it secured a comfortable second place and the knowledge that sometimes your best isn't good enough when someone posts 184.

**Signature Moment:** That 48-point opening round that briefly suggested Gregg might win his second Trophy. Then Alex showed up.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg played brilliant golf, posted a career-best score, and still lost by 11. Sometimes the universe just decides someone else gets to shine.

**Rating:** 9/10 for performance. 0/10 for timing. 7/10 for accepting second place gracefully (probably).

## David MULLIN - "The Paradox Perfected"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 162 pts, +22) | 1st (Gross: 51 strokes, **9th consecutive Green Jacket**)

### The Review

David Mullin led the Stableford competition for 37 holes across Rounds 2 and 3, posted 162 points (tied for 4th best ever), finished third, and won his ninth consecutive Green Jacket from that third-place finish. This is no longer a paradox. This is Dave's operating system.

**The Lead That Vanished:** Led for 37 holes. THIRTY-SEVEN. After Round 2, Dave led by six points. After Round 3, by one point. After Round 4, by... negative 22. Alex posted 51 points in the finale while Dave managed 30, and suddenly that commanding lead was ancient history.

**The Gross Domination:** Wire-to-wire. All four rounds won. Sixty-eight holes led out of 68 possible. Finished 12 strokes clear of Jon. The ninth consecutive jacket was never in doubt. Six birdies across four rounds. Peak Dave efficiency.

**The Stableford Story:** Led for more than half the tournament. Finished third. This should be disappointing. For Dave, it's just Tuesday.

**Signature Moment:** Winning his ninth Green Jacket from third place in Stableford. When your signature moment is a paradox, you've achieved brand consistency.

**Overall Assessment:** Dave threw away a 37-hole Stableford lead and still collected a trophy. He dominated Gross golf completely while being thoroughly beaten in Stableford. The paradox has achieved sentience and is now self-sustaining.

**Rating:** 10/10 for Gross. 6/10 for Stableford. 10/10 for maintaining the streak. 10/10 for confusing everyone.

## Jon BAKER - "The Forgettable Fourth"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 157 pts, +27) | 2nd (Gross: 63 strokes, +12)

### The Review

Jon Baker finished fourth with 157 points and second in Gross, which are both perfectly respectable results that nobody will remember because Alex posted 184 and Dave won his ninth jacket from third place.

**The Rounds:** 37-40-43-37. Started solid, improved through the middle rounds, faded in the finale. Jon peaked in Round 3 with 43 points, which would've been impressive if Alex hadn't been posting 49.

**The Birdie Drought:** One birdie. Total. Jon went 72 holes finding exactly one hole he could play better than par. This is golf's version of rationing during wartime.

**The Gross Runner-Up:** Second place, 12 strokes behind Dave. Jon has now perfected the art of finishing second in Gross to Dave's relentless dominance. It's a skill. Not a particularly valuable one, but a skill nonetheless.

**Signature Moment:** None. Jon played four rounds of solid, unremarkable golf while more interesting things happened around him.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon finished fourth in a six-player field, which sounds worse than it is until you realize fifth was Stu and sixth was Patterson with zero birdies. Fourth is fine. Fourth is professional. Fourth is completely forgettable when someone's breaking records and Dave's collecting his ninth jacket.

**Rating:** 6/10 for consistency. 3/10 for being memorable. 7/10 for avoiding disasters.

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Reliable Mid-Packer"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 144 pts, +40) | 5th (Gross: 125 strokes, +74)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann posted 144 Stableford points and fifth place, which is his most consistent finish: not wooden spoon, not trophy contention, just comfortably mid-table mediocrity.

**The Rounds:** 32-32-41-39. Stu spent the first two rounds posting identical 32-point scores, apparently operating on autopilot, before waking up in Round 3 with 41 points. Too little, too late to challenge, but enough to secure fifth.

**The Zero-Birdie Club:** Joined Patterson in the "72 holes without a birdie" club. Stu treated birdies like cryptocurrency—theoretically possible, never actually acquired.

**The Consistency:** Fifth in both Stableford and Gross. Stu achieved perfect mediocrity across both competitions. Some players dominate. Some struggle. Stu just... exists in the middle.

**Signature Moment:** Those identical 32-point rounds to open the tournament. When your signature achievement is mathematical consistency, you're not making headlines.

**Overall Assessment:** Stu played four rounds of forgettable golf to secure fifth place, 40 points behind the winner and 32 ahead of the wooden spoon. Perfectly average. Thoroughly unremarkable. Exactly what you'd expect.

**Rating:** 5/10 for everything. Literally everything. Stu is golf's version of a baseline.

## John PATTERSON - "The Zero-Birdie Wooden Spoon"

**Final Position:** 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 112 pts, +72) | 6th (Gross: 132 strokes, +81)

### The Review

John Patterson won TEG 9 on debut with 168 points. One year later, he collected the wooden spoon with 112 points and zero birdies in 72 holes. This is golf's version of winning Best Picture then getting cancelled.

**The Birdie Drought:** ZERO. Not one birdie across four rounds. Patterson spent 72 holes failing to play a single hole better than par. Eagles require two better than par, which means Patterson would've needed to stack two TEG 10s back-to-back just to threaten an eagle.

**The Rounds:** 29-25-29-29. Metronomically terrible. Three rounds of 29 points sandwiched around one 25-point disaster. Patterson treated consistency like a virtue, forgetting that consistency at a terrible level is still terrible.

**The Margin:** Finished 72 points behind the winner and 32 behind fifth place. Patterson didn't just finish last; he finished in a different postal code.

**The Reality:** From debut champion to wooden spoon in 12 months. Patterson's sophomore slump was less a slump and more a cliff dive into mediocrity.

**Signature Moment:** Completing 72 holes without a single birdie. When your signature achievement is an absence of achievement, you've had a rough week.

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson's wooden spoon was earned through four days of grinding, joyless golf that never once threatened to be good. Zero birdies. Last place by a mile. The defending champion's nightmare made real.

**Rating:** 2/10 for performance. 0/10 for birdies (literally). 10/10 for the most dramatic year-over-year decline.
