# TEG 5 - Brief Summary

Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory at Boavista, finishing with 156 points (using the old net vs par format) and an 11-point margin over Gregg Williams. Leading from Round 1's commanding 45-point opener through to a solid 35-point finale, Jon never relinquished control across four rounds of clinical consistency. His second title in three years confirmed his status among TEG's elite.

The tournament's extraordinary subplot featured Dave Mullin's simultaneously triumphant and disastrous performance: he claimed his fourth consecutive Green Jacket with dominant gross scoring (92 strokes, 6 clear of the field) while also collecting his first wooden spoon for finishing last in the net competition. The same rounds that delivered stroke play dominance left him trailing badly in the net standings—golf's dual scoring systems producing their most absurd outcome yet. Champion and wooden spoon holder, all in one weekend.

Gregg Williams' 145 points earned his best-ever TEG finish in second place, while Henry Meller (137 points, four birdies) claimed bronze and Stuart Neumann (135 points) finished fourth. TEG 5 will be remembered for Jon's commanding victory and Dave's beautiful paradox—proof that in golf, you can be both hero and villain in the same breath.
