# TEG 4 - Player Profiles

---

## David MULLIN - 1st (Stableford: 137 pts) | 1st (Gross: wins by 4 strokes, **Green Jacket**)

David Mullin arrived at Ashdown Forest and proceeded to demonstrate that winning both trophies doesn't require excitementâ€”just the ability to not lose when it matters.

**The Opening:** Tied with Jon at 33 points in Round 1. Uninspiring? Absolutely. Effective? Eventually.

**The Wobble:** Round 2 saw Jon surge past with 37 points while David posted 34. For a brief moment, David was second. The horror. The indignity. The... temporary inconvenience.

## Jon BAKER - 2nd (Stableford: 132 pts, +5) | 3rd (Gross: +6 strokes)

Jon Baker spent TEG 4 learning a valuable lesson: defending titles is hard. Winning them back from David is harder. Probably impossible, actually. But sometimes you lose the tournament and still make history.

**The Start:** Tied with David at 33 points. So far, so good. Championship defense looking solid. Trophy cabinet space: still reserved.

**The Surge:** Round 2's 37 pointsâ€”BRILLIANT. Led by 4 points. The trophy was visible. The champagne was chilling. Jon was back, baby!

## Henry MELLER - 3rd (Stableford: 132 pts, +5) | 5th (Gross)

Henry Meller collected bronze with 132 points by doing what Henry does best: hitting birdies that ultimately don't matter.

**The Birdie Count:** Four. FOUR. Henry was out here collecting birdies like PokÃ©mon cards while David was collecting trophies with zero birdies. The lesson is clear: golf rewards boring over brilliant.

**Round 2 Glory:** Thirty-six points including three birdies. Best round until that point. Thrilling golf that lifted Henry to... third place. Where he stayed. Forever.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 4th (Stableford: 121 pts, +16) | 2nd (Gross: +4 strokes)

Stuart Neumann finished fourth with 121 points through the simple strategy of being present and mostly competent.

**The Rounds:** 27-33-30-31. That's not a progression; that's a random number generator with a bias toward low 30s. Stuartplayed golf like someone who'd read the rulebook but skipped the chapter on "winning."

**The gross Surprise:** Second place! Four strokes behind David. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that makes people say "good for you" while secretly trying to remember your name.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 114 pts, +23) | 5th (Gross)

Gregg Williams claimed his first wooden spoon with 114 points and nine triple bogeys, proving that commitment to disaster eventually gets rewarded.

**The Opening Statement:** Round 1: 24 points, four triple bogeys. Gregg opened his tournament by demonstrating every possible way to implode. It was comprehensive. It was thorough. It was catastrophic.

**The Acceleration:** Round 2: 29 points, FIVE triple bogeys. FIVE. That's not golf; that's a cry for help. Gregg had nine triple bogeys through two rounds. NINE. By this point, the wooden spoon wasn't coming; it was already gift-wrapped with his name on it.
