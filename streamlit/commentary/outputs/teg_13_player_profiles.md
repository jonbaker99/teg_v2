*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 13*

## Jon BAKER - "The Hat-Trick Hero"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 158 pts) | 1st (Gross: 69 strokes, **3rd Green Jacket**)
**Achievement:** 3rd TEG Trophy, 3rd Green Jacket, 3rd Double

### The Review

Jon Baker completed the hat-trick: three TEG Trophies, three Green Jackets, three double victories. One hundred fifty-eight Stableford points won by 3 over Gregg—Jon's tightest margin yet—while 69 strokes over par won Gross by 13. Sometimes dominance needs drama (Stableford), sometimes it doesn't (Gross).

**The Comeback:** Trailed Gregg by 7 after Round 1 (37 to Gregg's 44). Then posted 42 points in Round 2 to take the lead. Never surrendered it. Classic Jon—start slow, finish relentless.

**The 4-Point Hole:** Round 2, Hole 18, par 4. Jon holed a birdie worth 4 Stableford points, demonstrating that occasionally he could produce excellence rather than just grinding competence. That 4-pointer helped build his Round 2 lead.

**The Gross Dominance:** Won Rounds 2, 3, and 4. Lost only Round 1 to Gregg. Finished 13 strokes clear of second place. Jon treated Gross golf like a formality—show up, win rounds, collect jacket.

**The Tight Finish:** Three-point Stableford margin was Jon's closest victory yet. Gregg never quit, never collapsed. Jon just accumulated points slightly faster for slightly longer. Victory by attrition.

**Signature Moment:** That Round 2 comeback from 7 down to 2 ahead, featuring a 4-point birdie and 42 total points. When your signature moment is erasing a deficit and taking permanent control, you've had a championship week.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's third double was earned through Round 2 brilliance and Rounds 3-4 grinding. Three trophies, three jackets, three doubles. The hat-trick complete. Jon has perfected the art of being relentlessly better than everyone else just often enough to win.

**Rating:** 10/10 for the hat-trick. 9/10 for that tight finish. 10/10 for Gross dominance.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Perpetual Runner-Up"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 155 pts, +3) | 4th (Gross: 89 strokes, +20)

### The Review

Gregg Williams posted 155 Stableford points—his closest brush with victory in six years—and still finished 3 points behind Jon. Led after Round 1, then watched Jon take control and never look back. This is becoming Gregg's signature: lead early, lose late.

**The Strong Start:** Forty-four points in Round 1 built a 7-point lead over Jon. Gregg looked dominant, comfortable, destined for victory. Then Jon posted 42 in Round 2, and Gregg's lead evaporated into "briefly competitive."

**The Rounds:** 44-33-37-41. Started brilliantly, faded in Round 2 (33 points while Jon posted 42), recovered in Rounds 3-4 but never caught Jon. The scoring pattern of someone who peaked too early.

**Never Won After R1:** First in Round 1. Then 4th, 3rd, 2nd in subsequent rounds. Gregg spent the final three rounds chasing Jon and never quite catching him.

**The 3-Point Margin:** Closest anyone's finished to Jon across his three victories. Gregg pushed Jon harder than anyone, which is admirable consolation for finishing second.

**Signature Moment:** That 44-point opening round that built a 7-point lead. When your signature achievement lasts exactly one round before evaporating, you're not winning championships.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg played brilliant golf, posted 155 points that would've won some tournaments, and still lost by 3. Sometimes being very good isn't enough when someone's being slightly better. Runner-up again. Perpetually close, perpetually second.

**Rating:** 9/10 for performance. 3/10 for converting leads. 6/10 for accepting silver (again).

## John PATTERSON - "The Eagle Specialist"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 131 pts, +27) | 5th (Gross: 109 strokes, +40)
**Historic Achievement:** THE THIRD EVER TEG EAGLE (R4, H2, Par 5) - **HIS SECOND EAGLE**

### The Review

John Patterson holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 4 for eagle—the third eagle in 13 tournaments of TEG history and Patterson's second. With only three eagles ever scored, Patterson owns two of them, making him TEG's unofficial eagle king.

**The Eagle:** Hole 2, Round 4, Portugal. Par 5. Patterson holed his second shot for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. His second eagle after TEG 4 (par 4, Hole 8). Nine tournaments between eagles, then boom—history made again.

**TEG's Eagle King:** Three eagles total in 13 tournaments (936 holes). Patterson has two. Jon Baker has one. Stu Neumann has one. Patterson is the only player to score multiple eagles, making him TEG's most exclusive club's most exclusive member.

**The Tournament:** One hundred thirty-one points secured fifth place, 27 behind Jon. Patterson never threatened the leaders, never challenged for trophies. Then holed that eagle in Round 4 and made history regardless.

**The Rounds:** 31-35-32-33. Metronomically mediocre for four rounds, with that one spectacular eagle embedded in Round 4's 33 points. The eagle accounted for 5 of those 33 points—without it, Patterson would've posted 28 and finished even farther back.

**The Timing:** The eagle came in Round 4 when the tournament was decided and Patterson was firmly in fifth. But eagles don't care about context. They're rare regardless of when they arrive.

**Signature Moment:** That par 5 eagle on Hole 2. Patterson will always own "most TEG eagles" unless someone scores three. That's worth more than most fifth-place finishes.

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson finished fifth with 131 points and made TEG history for the second time. Two eagles across ten tournaments. The eagle specialist. Sometimes you don't need to win to achieve something nobody else can match.

**Rating:** 10/10 for that eagle. 10/10 for owning 2 of 3 all-time. 5/10 for fifth place.

## Alex BAKER - "The Forgotten Fourth"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 139 pts, +19) | 6th (Gross: 110 strokes, +41)

### The Review

Alex Baker finished fourth with 139 Stableford points, which is perfectly respectable and utterly forgettable when Jon's winning hat-tricks and Patterson's scoring eagles.

**The Rounds:** 33-36-34-36. Consistent mediocrity across four rounds. Alex never threatened, never collapsed, never did anything worth remembering. Fourth place secured through professional competence and nothing more.

**One Birdie:** Alex found exactly one birdie across 72 holes, suggesting birdies are theoretical concepts he's aware of but not particularly committed to executing.

**Never Led:** Fourth after Round 1. Fifth after Round 2. Fourth after Rounds 3 and 4. Alex spent the tournament occupying fourth place like rental furniture.

**Signature Moment:** None exist. Alex played four rounds of forgettable golf while more interesting things happened elsewhere.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex's fourth-place finish was earned through four rounds of professional mediocrity. One hundred thirty-nine points, one birdie, zero memorable moments. Sometimes showing up is all you manage.

**Rating:** 5/10 for consistency. 2/10 for being memorable. 0/10 for birdies (well, 1/72 technically).

## David MULLIN - "The Triple Wooden Spoon Collector"

**Final Position:** 6th (**3rd consecutive Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 132 pts, +26) | 3rd (Gross: 82 strokes, +13)

### The Review

David Mullin collected his third consecutive wooden spoon with 132 Stableford points, one point ahead of Patterson. After nine Green Jackets, Dave had now finished last three years running. The dynasty was dead, and the decline had achieved permanence.

**Triple Spoons:** TEG 11: wooden spoon (125 pts). TEG 12: wooden spoon (139 pts). TEG 13: wooden spoon (132 pts). Dave has perfected the art of finishing last with gradually varying levels of mediocrity.

**The Small Victory:** Won Round 3 in Gross—Dave's first round victory since TEG 11. Muscle memory occasionally resurfaces, suggesting the former champion still exists somewhere beneath the wooden spoon collector.

**The Gross Consolation:** Third place, 13 strokes behind Jon. Dave won one Gross round, lost three others, never threatened the Green Jacket. After nine consecutive jackets, finishing third feels like failure.

**By One Point:** Avoided sixth by one point over Patterson (132-131). Dave's wooden spoon was secured by the narrowest possible margin, which somehow makes it worse.

**Signature Moment:** Winning Round 3 in Gross while simultaneously confirming his third consecutive wooden spoon. When your signature achievement is one good round surrounded by sustained mediocrity, golf is mocking you.

**Overall Assessment:** Dave's third wooden spoon confirmed the dynasty would never return. Three years of last place after nine years of dominance. One Gross round victory doesn't compensate for three wooden spoons. The fall is complete.

**Rating:** 2/10 for Stableford. 6/10 for that R3 Gross win. 10/10 for sustained decline.

## Henry MELLER - "The Last Place Above Last Place"

**Final Position:** 6th (tied with Dave, Stableford: 121 pts, +37) | 2nd (Gross: 82 strokes, +13, tied with Dave)

### The Review

Henry Meller returned to TEG after missing several tournaments and promptly finished sixth with 121 points, tied with Dave in Gross but mercifully not awarded the wooden spoon due to tiebreak rules.

**The Comeback:** First TEG since... actually, who remembers? Henry showed up, posted 121 points, finished last (or second-to-last depending on tiebreaks), proved he hadn't improved during his absence.

**The Rounds:** 28-31-30-32. Metronomically mediocre from start to finish. Henry treated consistency like a virtue, forgetting that being consistently bad is still bad.

**Tied With Dave:** Both finished with 121 Stableford points and 82 Gross strokes. The difference: Dave got the wooden spoon based on tiebreak rules. Henry got... sixth place and the knowledge he was exactly as bad as Dave.

**Signature Moment:** Tying for last place with a three-time consecutive wooden spoon winner. When your signature achievement is "equally terrible," you've had a rough comeback.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry's return featured 121 points, sixth place, and the dubious honor of being exactly as bad as Dave. Welcome back. You were missed by nobody.

**Rating:** 3/10 for showing up. 2/10 for performance. 10/10 for perfectly matching Dave's awfulness.
