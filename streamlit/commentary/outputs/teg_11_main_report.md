# TEG 11: Jon Baker's Double Sweep Ends Brother's Title Dream

Jon Baker claimed his third TEG Trophy and maiden Green Jacket with a masterclass in controlled aggression, sweeping both competitions with 143 Stableford points and a +70 gross total. The victory, by six points in Stableford and three strokes in gross, marked the first double-title sweep since TEG 8 and showcased Baker's ability to lead from the front—holding the Stableford lead for 59 of 72 holes and the gross lead for an astonishing 70. 

But this was no serene procession. The Catalonian drama turned on a sibling rivalry defined by volatility versus consistency, culminating in one of the tournament's great collapses. Brother Alex held the Stableford lead entering the final round, only to hemorrhage 15 points with a disastrous 27-point finale featuring five disasters and four zero-point holes. Jon's steady rounds (35-41-32-35) proved the antidote to the chaos engulfing the field—39 combined zero-point holes across five players painted a tournament of spectacular carnage.

The weekend also delivered one of TEG's most delicious paradoxes: David Mullin finishing second in the gross competition (+73) whilst simultaneously claiming the Wooden Spoon with dead-last in Stableford (125 points). And then there was John Patterson's redemption arc—from a 26-point opening disaster to a tournament-best 39-point finale—completing a four-round journey through 21 worse-than-double-bogey holes. This was golf as rollercoaster, with only Jon Baker managing to keep both hands on the controls.

## Round 1: Patterson's Front-Nine Mirage

Jon Baker and David Mullin shared the gross lead at +18 after an opening round at PGA Catalunya's Stadium course that saw the Stableford lead change hands four times through seven holes. But it was Patterson's front-nine brilliance—17 points anchored by aggressive play—that initially seized attention before reality reasserted itself with brutal efficiency.

The round's chaos began immediately. Williams opened with a disaster at the 1st (+3), while Patterson, Mullin, and Jon Baker all briefly held the lead through the opening holes. Alex Baker's struggles materialized at the 2nd with a disaster of his own, before Jon Baker seized control at the 3rd. Patterson's quintuple bogey at the 4th (+5) was merely a prelude to the back-nine bloodbath to come.

Mullin took both leads briefly at the 6th, but Patterson reclaimed the Stableford advantage at the 7th. The illusion wouldn't last. Patterson's back nine became a tour of disasters: holes 10, 12, 13 (quintuple bogey), 14, 16, and 17 yielded just nine points across nine holes. His cold spell from holes 12-17 produced a pitiful three points, including two quintuple bogeys and three other disasters. The contrast was staggering—17 points on the front, nine on the back.

Alex Baker endured his own horrors with disasters at the 11th and 13th (+4), whilst Williams managed a birdie at the 15th amidst his three disasters. Jon Baker's late disaster at the 18th barely dented his authority as he closed with 35 points, three clear of brother Alex's 32. Mullin's 29 and Patterson's 26 rounded out the top five, with Patterson's round defined by extremes: brilliance followed by carnage.

**Standings:** JB: 35pts/+18; AB: 32pts/+28; GW: 30pts/+29; DM: 29pts/+20; JP: 26pts/+40

### Round 2: Baker's Birdie, Brother's Quintuple

Jon Baker extended his lead to 76 points with a commanding 41-point second round at PGA Catalunya's Tour course, building a two-point cushion as the field continued its dance with disaster. But it was brother Alex's 42-point response—marred by a quintuple-bogey disaster at the 12th—that kept the pressure mounting.

The round belonged to contrasting narratives. Jon Baker's birdie at the 2nd set the tone, matched by Mullin's birdie at the same hole. Alex Baker looked menacing with four-point hauls at the 3rd and 8th, building momentum before the 12th-hole implosion buried him in a quintuple bogey and zero points. That single catastrophe would prove the difference between overtaking his brother and remaining in his shadow.

Patterson's nightmare continued unabated—triple bogeys at the 4th, 5th, 7th, and 10th, culminating in a sextuple bogey at the 15th and another triple at the 18th. His cold spell from holes 3-5 averaged +2.67 versus par, whilst the 13-18 stretch brought two zero-point disasters (15th and 18th) and 34 points in total. His 34-point round left him marooned at 60 points overall, 16 behind Jon Baker.

Williams carved out 39 points with a back-nine surge (22 points versus 17 on the front), highlighted by a five-point birdie at the 17th—the tournament's only such feat to that point. But disaster struck at the 15th with a quintuple bogey. Jon Baker's own disaster at the 17th (triple bogey, zero points) couldn't derail his momentum as he reached the halfway mark with a two-point advantage.

**Standings:** JB: 76pts/+30; AB: 74pts/+48; GW: 69pts/+49; DM: 65pts/+33; JP: 60pts/+71

### Round 3: Alex's Ascent, Jon's Back-Nine Meltdown

Alex Baker seized the Stableford lead with a 36-point round at El Prat's Azul course, capitalizing on brother Jon's back-nine collapse to claim a two-point advantage entering Sunday's finale. Jon Baker retained the gross lead despite disasters at the 12th, 13th, and 15th, but Alex's moment had arrived—and the tournament suddenly looked wide open.

The lead changed hands three times across the opening holes. Alex grabbed the Stableford advantage at the 1st before losing it immediately with a triple-bogey disaster at the 2nd. Williams joined the carnage with his own triple at the 2nd, whilst Patterson's triple bogey at the 1st set the tone for another volatile day. Mullin briefly took the gross lead at the 3rd before a quadruple-bogey disaster at the 6th ended his challenge, dropping him seven points behind Jon Baker.

Jon Baker's front nine was imperious—20 points including a birdie at the 9th. His hot spell from holes 7-9, averaging -0.33 versus par, showcased the form that had carried him to the halfway lead. But the back nine unraveled spectacularly. Disasters at the 12th and 13th yielded zero and one point respectively, and a cold spell from holes 11-13 produced just one point total. The triple bogey at the 15th completed the capitulation—12 points on the back nine versus 20 on the front.

Alex Baker pounced with steady golf, avoiding disasters after the early stumble. His triple bogey at the 18th cost him breathing room but couldn't erase his two-point cushion. Mullin's twin disasters at the 11th and 13th (triple bogeys) yielded just one point across that three-hole stretch, whilst Patterson stormed home with a tournament-best 39 points, anchored by a four-point haul at the 11th.

**Standings:** AB: 113pts/+72; JB: 111pts/+51; JP: 109pts/+96; GW: 108pts/+72; DM: 97pts/+54

### Round 4: The Great Collapse

Jon Baker reclaimed both leads with surgical precision, dismantling brother Alex's title hopes on the 6th and 7th holes before cruising to a six-point Stableford victory and three-stroke gross triumph. Alex's capitulation—27 points with five disasters and four zero-point holes—ranks among the tournament's great final-round collapses, a 15-point surrender that turned a two-point lead into a six-point defeat.

The carnage began immediately. Alex held the Stableford lead through five holes, but disaster struck at the 6th with a triple bogey and zero points. Jon Baker seized the moment, grabbing the lead he'd never relinquish. The 7th hole confirmed Alex's nightmare as Jon extended his advantage whilst brother Alex's title dream evaporated. Jon's front-nine 20 points built an unassailable cushion.

Alex's cold spell from holes 4-9 yielded just five points, featuring disasters at the 6th and 9th. His second cold spell, holes 12-17, brought another six points with disasters at the 12th and 17th. The zeros piled up—four across the round—as Alex's gross total ballooned to +34, averaging +2.33 versus par across holes 4-9 and +2.50 across holes 12-17. The nine zero-point holes across his four rounds told the story of volatility unchecked.

Patterson delivered his redemption with a 36-point finale, his best round after the opening 26-point disaster. Three four-point holes (1st, 5th, 17th) showcased the aggressive golf that had tantalized on the first front nine, whilst five disasters reminded everyone this was still Patterson. Williams added 32 points but his quintuple-bogey disaster at the 10th prevented a stronger finish. Mullin's 31 points secured second in gross (+73) but couldn't rescue him from the Wooden Spoon (125 Stableford points).

Jon Baker closed with 35 points—steady, controlled, dominant. His consistency (standard deviation of 3.77 points per round) contrasted sharply with Alex's wild swings (6.34 points per round, 14-stroke gross range). Wire-to-wire control in gross (70 of 72 holes) and Stableford (59 of 72) delivered the double sweep, the first since TEG 8.

**Final Standings:** JB: 143pts/+70; AB: 137pts/+106; JP: 135pts/+123; GW: 126pts/+99; DM: 125pts/+73

## Tournament Recap

Jon Baker's third TEG Trophy and first Green Jacket arrived not through dominance alone, but through the discipline to outlast the chaos consuming his rivals. In a tournament defined by 39 combined zero-point holes and the highest volatility metrics in TEG history, Baker's consistency—four rounds between 32 and 41 points, standard deviation of just 3.77—proved the winning formula. He led the Stableford battle for 59 of 72 holes and the gross race for 70, wire-to-wire control that belied the back-nine disasters littering his Saturday scorecard.

But this victory tastes sweetest in the context of sibling rivalry. Brother Alex held the lead entering Sunday, only to implode with a 27-point finale featuring five disasters and four zeros. Nine zero-point holes across four rounds—more than any player—underscored Alex's feast-or-famine approach. His second-place finish (137 points, +106) arrived despite the 14-stroke gross range and 6.34 standard deviation that defined his week. Consistency crowned king; volatility crowned second.

The supporting cast delivered theatre in abundance. David Mullin's Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in gross (+73) ranks among TEG's great paradoxes—excellent ball-striking, catastrophic Stableford scoring. John Patterson's redemption arc from 26-point disaster to 39-point triumph, navigating 21 worse-than-double-bogey holes along the way, showcased resilience bordering on stubbornness. And Gregg Williams's five-point birdie at Round 2's 17th—the tournament's only such feat—provided a momentary glimpse of excellence amidst seven disasters.

Catalonia delivered on its promise of drama, five years after TEG 6's previous visit. The return to PGA Catalunya's Stadium and Tour courses, plus the debut of El Prat's Azul, provided a stern test that exposed every weakness and rewarded only the most composed. Jon Baker answered every question, weathering his brother's challenge and the field's chaos to claim the double sweep. In a tournament of spectacular collapses and wild swings, he simply refused to join the carnage. That, ultimately, made all the difference.
