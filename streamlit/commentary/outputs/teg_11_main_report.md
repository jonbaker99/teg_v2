# TEG 11 Tournament Report: The Dynasty Ends

After nine consecutive Green Jackets, David Mullin finally faltered. He didn't just lose the jacketâ€”he collected his first-ever wooden spoon, finishing fifth in Stableford while Jon Baker claimed both trophies with wire-to-wire dominance. The Dave Mullin era of Gross golf supremacy ended at PGA Catalunya with a whimper, not a roar.

Jon's double victoryâ€”143 Stableford points and 70 strokes over parâ€”was comprehensive. He led 59 of 72 holes in Stableford and an absurd 70 of 72 in Gross. This wasn't a close tournament. This was Jon announcing that Dave's decade of dominance was over.

## The Wire-to-Wire Demolition

Jon Baker opened with 35 Stableford points to take the early lead. Round 2's 32 points extended his advantage to three. Round 3's 37-point performance pushed his lead to seven. By Round 4, the tournament was effectively overâ€”Jon posted 39 points to seal a 6-point victory over Alex.

The Gross competition was even more dominant. Jon led after every single round, finishing 3 strokes clear of Dave. Seventy holes led out of 72 possible. That's not winningâ€”that's colonization.

Two birdies across four rounds. Jon didn't need to be spectacular. He just needed to be relentlessly competent while everyone else made mistakes. Classic TEG winning formula, executed to perfection.

## Dave's First Wooden Spoon

David Mullin had won nine consecutive Green Jackets across nine tournaments. Then TEG 11 arrived, and suddenly Dave was posting 125 Stableford points and finishing fifth. Last place. Wooden spoon. The nightmare scenario.

The Gross story wasn't much better: second place, three strokes behind Jon. Dave won zero rounds in Gross (Jon won all four). He briefly led for 10 holes midway through but never threatened after Round 2. The streak was over.

Dave's 125 points marked his worst-ever Stableford performance. Two birdies, 28 bogeys, 17 double bogeys. The grinding efficiency had evaporated, replaced by mistakes and mediocrity. After nine tournaments of dominance, Dave remembered what finishing last felt like.

The Dave Mullin dynasty: 2009-2017. Cause of death: Jon Baker's wire-to-wire excellence.

## The Zero-Birdie Runners-Up

Alex Baker finished second with 137 points and zero birdies. John Patterson finished fourth with 135 points and zero birdies. Between them, 272 Stableford points without once playing a hole better than par.

Alex led after Round 1 with 32 points, briefly threatening to repeat his TEG 10 heroics. Then Jon posted three consecutive rounds of 32-37-39 to pull away, and Alex's challenge faded. Zero birdies across 72 holes is impressive commitment to mediocrity, even in second place.

Patterson's zero-birdie performance was his second consecutive tournament without a birdie (144 holes total). At some point, you start wondering if Patterson knows birdies are worth extra points.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Jon 35 (leads), Alex 32, Patterson 30, Gregg 28, Dave 27 (already in trouble)

**Round 2:** Jon 67 total (extends to +3), Alex 64, Patterson 60, Gregg 59, Dave 55 (wooden spoon brewing)

**Round 3:** Jon 104 (dominates by 7), Alex 97, Gregg 96, Patterson 94, Dave 85 (spoon confirmed)

**Round 4:** Jon 143 (seals double by 6), Alex 137, Gregg 136, Patterson 135, Dave 125 (wooden spoon secured)

## The Verdict

Jon Baker's double victory ended Dave Mullin's nine-tournament reign of Gross golf supremacy. The wire-to-wire dominanceâ€”59 of 72 holes led in Stableford, 70 of 72 in Grossâ€”was comprehensive. Jon didn't just win; he dismantled the field.

Dave's first wooden spoon after nine Green Jackets marked the end of an era. 125 points and fifth place. Last in Stableford, second in Gross (3 behind Jon). The streak was over, and the wooden spoon was his.

Alex's runner-up finish (zero birdies, 137 points) and Gregg's bronze (136 points) were respectable. Patterson's fourth-place zero-birdie performance (135 points) was becoming a pattern.

The Dave Mullin dynasty had ended. The Jon Baker era had begun. PGA Catalunya witnessed the changing of the guard.
