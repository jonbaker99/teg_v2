# TEG 10: Alex Baker's Maiden Triumph and the Tale of Two Competitions

## Tournament Summary

In a tournament that spoke eloquently to the peculiar genius of handicapped golf, Alex Baker finally shed his runner-up curse with a commanding 11-point victory in the TEG Trophy, while David Mullin collected his ninth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance that somehow wasn't enough to win the main event. Baker's breakthrough – after consecutive bridesmaid finishes at TEG 8 and 9 – came via a barnstorming final 36 holes worth 98 combined points, overturning a five-point halfway deficit with the kind of late-tournament surge that makes Stableford scoring so gloriously unpredictable.

Mullin's paradox defined the week in the Algarve: leading every single Stableford standings through 54 holes, leading the Gross competition for 68 of 72 holes, yet ultimately surrendering the Trophy when Baker unleashed a record-equaling 51-point final round. It was a masterclass in different competitions rewarding different virtues – Mullin's consistency and gross excellence securing a 12-stroke Green Jacket victory, Baker's handicapped volatility and clutch timing claiming the silverware that matters most. Gregg Williams completed a curious historical footnote by finishing runner-up in both competitions despite never having previously won a Green Jacket, finishing 11 points behind Baker and 12 strokes behind Mullin.

The tournament also witnessed John Patterson's descent into a personal hell: 20 zero-point holes across 72, averaging over three disasters per round, finishing 72 points behind Baker in the worst-to-winner margin in recorded TEG history. His nightmare provided the tournament's dark counterpoint to Baker's redemption arc, a reminder that in golf, as in life, timing is everything. Five years after TEG 5, the return to Portuguese courses produced drama worthy of the gap – and two winners who demonstrated that in handicapped golf, dominating different metrics can lead to entirely different trophy cabinets.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Mullin's Boavista Masterclass

David Mullin announced his intentions with the kind of opening statement that brooks no argument. At Boavista – a course making its fourth TEG appearance – Mullin carded a gross 75 (matching his own course record from previous visits) and a commanding 49 Stableford points, seizing both competition leads on the opening hole and never relinquishing his grip. The eight-point margin over Alex Baker in second was emphatic; the 14-stroke advantage over the Gross field equally so.

Mullin's round was a thing of structured beauty. After establishing control early, he produced a mid-round burst from holes 12-14 worth 11 points, anchored by consecutive birdies on the 13th and 14th. Another birdie at the 16th extended his hot spell through holes 13-18 to 20 points, pulling away from the field with clinical precision. His back nine of 28 points – seven better than his front – suggested a player finding rhythm rather than merely surviving.

Behind him, Alex Baker's round told a more chaotic story. A disaster at the 2nd (septuple bogey for +4) and another at the 8th established a pattern of volatility that would define his week. Yet even in adversity, Baker showed glimpses of the form that would eventually win him the Trophy – his four-pointer at the 11th briefly gave him the Stableford lead before Mullin's excellence reasserted itself. Baker's 41 points and 28 gross strokes left him eight back but very much in contention.

The round's real carnage belonged to others. John Patterson's disasters at the 6th and 8th – the latter a quintuple bogey – set an ominous tone for his week. His 29 points marked both an all-time personal worst and a mere preview of horrors to come. Stuart Neumann's finish was equally grim: consecutive disasters at the 17th and 18th, culminating in a sextuple bogey on the last, left him marooned in the Spoon position with 32 points.

**R1 Scores:** DM: 49pts/+4; AB: 41pts/+28; GW: 38pts/+25; JB: 37pts/+18; SN: 32pts/+36; JP: 29pts/+31

### Round 2: Contrasting Fortunes at Palmares

On Palmares' Praia/Alvor layout – a new course for the TEG – David Mullin did what leaders do: consolidated without fireworks. His 42 points extended his advantage to five points over a suddenly crowded chasing pack, while a gross 82 (+11) saw him share the Gross lead with Jon Baker at +15. The question wasn't whether Mullin could be caught, but who among the pursuers could mount a sustained challenge.

The answer, emphatically, was Gregg Williams. His 48-point round – a new personal best – was built on a devastating stretch from holes 8-10 worth 12 points, culminating in a birdie at the 10th. The momentum carried through holes 6-11 (20 points), announcing Williams as a genuine Trophy contender. His move from third to second, now just five back, gave the tournament its first hint of real tension.

Alex Baker matched Williams' 45-point output but did so in characteristically volatile fashion. A birdie at the 9th sparked a hot spell through holes 4-9 (19 points), but a disaster at the 16th threatened to derail his charge. Still, 45 points kept him level with Jon Baker in the standings and very much in the hunt. Jon Baker's own 45 points – anchored by a birdie at the 2nd that was the only one in the opening stretch – came with a tournament-best gross round of 81 (+10), suggesting he too was finding form.

The round belonged, in misery, to Stuart Neumann. His back-nine collapse was comprehensive: consecutive disasters at the 13th and 14th, another at the 15th (three disasters spanning holes 13-15 worth zero points), and a final disaster at the 18th (sextuple bogey) completed a stretch from holes 13-18 worth just six points. His 37 points left him 19 behind Mullin and staring at a fifth-place finish unless something extraordinary occurred.

John Patterson's travails continued. A disaster at the opening hole (septuple bogey for +6) set the worst possible tone, followed by consecutive disasters at the 10th and 11th. His 35 points represented a marginal improvement on Round 1's horror show, but the gap to Mullin – now 27 points – looked insurmountable.

**R2 Scores:** DM: 42pts/+11; GW: 48pts/+14; AB: 45pts/+23; JB: 45pts/+10; SN: 37pts/+33; JP: 35pts/+25

### Round 3: The Palmares Shootout

On Palmares' Alvor/Lagos combination, the tournament exploded into chaos. David Mullin's 54-hole stranglehold on the Stableford lead finally broke under pressure from Alex Baker and Gregg Williams, who emerged from the maelstrom tied for the lead at 133 points apiece. Mullin's 31-point round – a distant fifth on the day – saw him slip to third, just two points back. After leading every Stableford standings through 54 holes, Mullin suddenly faced the prospect of surrendering the Trophy he'd controlled all week.

The round was defined by wild swings in fortune. Alex Baker's day encapsulated the madness: he scored a hot spell from holes 2-7 worth 18 points (including four-pointers at the 4th and 6th), briefly seizing the lead multiple times. But a quintuple bogey at the 13th – a disaster that dropped him from the lead – threatened to undo everything. Yet somehow, by the 15th, he'd retaken the lead, finishing with 47 points in a round that featured more lead changes than seemed physically possible.

Gregg Williams matched Baker's 47 points with rather more consistency, claiming the lead at the 13th when Baker faltered and never fully relinquishing it. His birdie at the 17th – matched by Mullin in a rare show of resistance – helped secure his share of the overnight lead. The tournament now had two leaders, with Mullin lurking just two points behind, and Jon Baker a further 11 back after a 35-point round.

The real story, though, was John Patterson's complete disintegration. His middle stretch from holes 12-14 produced zero points from three consecutive disasters, including quintuple bogeys at both the 12th and 13th. The carnage continued through holes 13-15 (another zero-point run), leaving him with just 27 points for the round – another personal worst. His gross 103 (+36) was almost incomprehensible: averaging four over par per hole across a six-hole stretch (holes 10-15), including disasters at the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th. At 91 total points, Patterson trailed the leaders by 42.

**R3 Scores:** AB: 47pts/+22; GW: 47pts/+15; JB: 35pts/+20; SN: 36pts/+29; DM: 31pts/+23; JP: 27pts/+36

### Round 4: Baker's Record-Tying Breakaway

Back at Boavista for the finale, Alex Baker delivered the round of his life when it mattered most. His 51-point explosion – tying the all-time TEG record – was built on a devastating stretch from holes 5-10 worth 21 points, featuring three four-pointers (at the 6th, 7th, and 10th) that ripped the Trophy from Gregg Williams' grasp. By the time Baker reached the 11th, his lead was insurmountable. Williams' own 40 points – perfectly respectable in any other context – couldn't keep pace, and he'd slip to an 11-point defeat despite his birdie at the 5th briefly giving him the lead.

The drama of Baker's charge was amplified by Williams' simultaneous collapse. At the 6th, Williams carded a quadruple bogey disaster just as Baker was scoring four points, a six-point swing that transferred the lead and effectively decided the Trophy. Another disaster at the 18th – another quad bogey – sealed Williams' fate, though his 40-point round and 173-point total secured a clear runner-up finish.

David Mullin, meanwhile, played out the string with quiet excellence. His 40-point round – tied for second on the day – came with the day's best gross score of 84 (+13), secured by a birdie at the 16th. It was enough to clinch his ninth Green Jacket with a final tally of +51 over 72 holes, a 12-stroke victory over Williams (+76). Mullin had led the Gross standings for 68 of 72 holes, losing control only briefly in Round 2 when Jon Baker matched him. It was wire-to-wire dominance in one competition, a slow fade in the other – the essential paradox of TEG 10.

Jon Baker's 40 points left him fourth overall at 157 points, while Stuart Neumann's 39 kept him fifth at 144. Both played solid golf on the day; both were footnotes to the main narrative.

And then there was John Patterson. His final-round 21 points – featuring six disasters and five zero-point holes – completed the worst individual performance in TEG history. A quintuple bogey at the 8th (11 on a par 5), disasters at the 7th and 10th, and a closing nonuple bogey at the 18th (14 on a par 4) produced stretches of sustained horror: holes 7-12 worth just five points, holes 13-18 worth six. His final tally of 112 points left him 72 behind Baker – the largest worst-to-winner margin ever recorded. His 20 zero-point holes across 72 represented not just a bad week but a complete existential crisis with the game of golf.

**R4 Scores:** AB: 51pts/+17; DM: 40pts/+13; GW: 40pts/+22; JB: 40pts/+15; SN: 39pts/+27; JP: 21pts/+40

## Tournament Recap

TEG 10 will be remembered for its study in contrasts: Alex Baker's redemptive breakthrough after consecutive near-misses, achieved through precisely the kind of late-tournament heroics that Stableford scoring rewards; David Mullin's clinical Gross dominance that somehow wasn't enough to defend his Stableford crown; and John Patterson's nightmarish descent into a record-worst performance that provided the tournament's cautionary tale.

Baker's maiden Trophy – built on 98 points across the final 36 holes – proved that patience and timing matter more than consistency in handicapped competition. His record-tying 51-point finale was the stuff of which legends are made, a round that featured 21 points from just six holes (5-10) and transformed him from co-leader to untouchable champion. That he finished +90 gross while winning by 11 points speaks to everything that makes Stableford golf both maddening and magnificent.

Mullin's ninth Green Jacket will offer scant consolation for surrendering a lead he'd held for 37 of 72 holes in the Stableford standings. Leading both competitions through three rounds, then losing the main event on the final day, is the kind of sporting cruelty that defines major championship heartbreak. Yet his +51 gross total – 25 strokes better than Williams in second – confirms his status as the week's best pure golfer, even if not its most decorated.

Five years after TEG 5, the Algarve had delivered a tournament for the ages, complete with new course debuts, record performances, and the kind of sporting justice that sees a twice-denied runner-up finally claim his crown. That it took Baker 16 rounds to get there only makes the triumph sweeter.
