# TEG 10 Tournament Report: Alex Baker's Once-in-a-Lifetime

One year after John Patterson strolled into his debut TEG and won, Alex Baker decided debuts were overrated. After eight tournaments of mid-table mediocrity punctuated by the occasional wooden spoon, Alex posted 184 Stableford points across four rounds at Portugal's finest courses and collected the only TEG Trophy of his career. It remains the highest score in TEG history to that point.

Meanwhile, David Mullin—doing David Mullin things—led the Stableford competition for 37 holes, finished third, and won his ninth consecutive Green Jacket anyway. The paradox had achieved sentience.

## The 184-Point Masterpiece

Alex Baker's 184 points wasn't just a personal best. It was THE best—the highest Stableford total in the first ten tournaments. Forty-two, 42, 49, 51 across four rounds. The kind of consistent excellence that suggested Alex had figured out Stableford golf, or at minimum had remembered to bring his game.

Round 1 posted 42 points and third place. Respectable. Gregg led with 48, Dave had 44, and Alex sat two back thinking "not bad." Round 2's 42 points moved him to second behind Dave. Round 3's 49-point explosion gave him the lead for the first time, one point ahead of Dave.

Then came Round 4. Fifty-one points. The second-best single round in TEG history to that point. Alex dismantled Praia D'El Rey like someone who'd been taking notes for eight tournaments and finally decided to show his work. He won the final round by seven points and the tournament by 11. Runner-up Gregg never stood a chance.

Alex led for 33 holes total, which sounds modest until you realize 30 of those came in the final two rounds when it actually mattered.

## The Dave Mullin Paradox: Chapter Nine

Dave Mullin arrived at TEG 10 having won eight consecutive Green Jackets. He departed having won nine, despite finishing third in Stableford 22 points behind the winner. This is peak Dave—dominating one competition while being thoroughly beaten in the other.

The Stableford story: Dave led for 37 holes across Rounds 2 and 3, posted 162 points (tied for 4th best to date), and still finished third. He was in contention through three rounds (trailing Alex by just 1 after R3), then posted 30 points in Round 4 while Alex went nuclear with 51. Dave's lead evaporated like morning mist.

The Gross story: Wire-to-wire dominance. Dave led all 68 holes he could lead, won all four rounds, finished 12 strokes clear of Jon. His ninth consecutive Green Jacket was never in doubt. Six birdies across four rounds. Ruthless efficiency.

The paradox: Lead Stableford for 37 holes, finish third. Dominate Gross completely, win ninth straight jacket. Dave has perfected the art of simultaneous excellence and disappointment.

## Patterson's Zero-Birdie Disaster

John Patterson won TEG 9 on debut with 168 points and four birdies. One year later, he collected the wooden spoon with 112 points and zero birdies. ZERO. Not one birdie in 72 holes. This is golf's version of winning an Oscar then getting fired from your next three movies.

Patterson's 112 points finished 72 behind the winner and 32 behind fifth-place Stu. The defending champion spent four days forgetting how to play golf better than par. Twenty-three bogeys, twelve double bogeys, and an assortment of triples made up his week. He never led a single hole in either competition.

From debut hero to wooden spoon in 12 months. The TEG giveth, and the TEG absolutely taketh away.

## Gregg's Silver Medal

Gregg Williams led after Round 1 with 48 points, briefly looking like someone who might win his second TEG Trophy. Then Alex remembered he was capable of playing golf, and Gregg's lead vanished.

Gregg posted 173 points—the second-best score to date—and still finished 11 behind Alex. His 48-45-42-38 scoring progression told the story: started strong, faded gradually, watched Alex cruise past in the final rounds. Runner-up by 11 points despite posting what would've been the winning score in most tournaments.

Four birdies across four rounds. Enough to challenge, not enough to win. Gregg spent TEG 10 being very good while Alex was being historic.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Gregg's 48 points led, Dave 44, Alex 42. Patterson opened with 25 points, immediately declaring "I will not defend this title successfully."

**Round 2:** Dave's 46 points took the Stableford lead (90 total), Alex moved to 84, Gregg slipped to 83. Dave led by six.

**Round 3:** Alex's 49-point explosion reclaimed the lead (133), Dave right behind (132), Gregg hanging on (130). One-point margin heading to the finale.

**Round 4:** Alex posted 51 points to seal it. Dave managed 30, Gregg 38. Alex won the round by seven and the tournament by 11. Dave won Gross by 12. Patterson finished last by 32.

## The Verdict

TEG 10 belonged to Alex Baker. His 184 points set a new benchmark and delivered his only career trophy. It was dominant, clinical, and utterly unlike most of his previous TEG performances. Sometimes you wait eight tournaments for your moment, then make it count spectacularly.

Dave Mullin collected his ninth consecutive Green Jacket from third place, because of course he did. Gregg posted the second-best score ever and finished second. Patterson forgot how to birdie and collected a wooden spoon.

Alex's coronation, Dave's paradox, Patterson's collapse. TEG 10 in summary.
