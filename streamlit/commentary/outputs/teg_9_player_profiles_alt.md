# TEG 9 - Player Profiles

---

## John PATTERSON - 1st (Stableford: 168 pts) | 3rd (Gross: 88 strokes)

John Patterson walked into his first TEG at Royal Ã“bidos and proceeded to demonstrate that winning tournaments doesn't require flair, fireworks, or even particularly interesting golf. It just requires being slightly less terrible than everyone else, consistently, for 72 holes straight.

**The Rounds:** 38-49-34-47 Stableford points. That's not a scoring progression; that's a rollercoaster designed by someone who's never experienced excitement. Patterson won rounds 2 and 4, finished joint-4th in rounds 1 and 3, and somehow emerged with a 6-point victory. It's the golfing equivalent of winning a marathon by occasionally jogging.

**The Wire-to-Wire Myth:** Patterson led for 53 of 72 holes in Stableford. That sounds impressive until you realize he never threatened in gross (led for 1 hole), suggesting his dominance was less "crushing superiority" and more "everyone else was rubbish at Stableford scoring."

## Alex BAKER - 2nd (Stableford: 162 pts, +6) | 6th (Gross: 127 strokes, +60)

Alex Baker's TEG 9 can be summarized as follows: he finished second in his personal best TEG performance while also finishing dead last in gross. This is golf's version of quantum mechanicsâ€”existing in two states simultaneously, both of them confusing, one of them deeply embarrassing.

**The Paradox:** Personal best Stableford (162 points, 2nd all-time). Worst gross finish (6th, 60 strokes behind David). Second in points, last in strokes. Alex somehow achieved golf's greatest contradictionâ€”simultaneously excellent and terrible.

**The Rounds:** 32-44-42-44 Stableford points. After a pedestrian opening round, Baker posted three consecutive 40+ point rounds, including winning Round 3 with 42 points. This was competent, consistent Stableford golf. It still wasn't enough.

## David MULLIN - 3rd (Stableford: 148 pts, +20) | 1st (Gross: 67 strokes, **8th Green Jacket**)

David Mullin arrived at TEG 9 and collected his eighth consecutive Green Jacket by finishing third in Stableford. THIRD. By this point, the paradox had achieved self-awareness. David no longer needed to win Stableford to win gross. He just needed to show up, not embarrass himself, and let everyone else collapse.

**The Streak:** Eight consecutive Green Jackets. EIGHT. This is no longer a streak; it's a dynasty. It's a dictatorship. David has occupied the gross throne longer than some actual monarchs.

**The Dominance:** Led 62 of 72 holes in gross. Won all four rounds in gross. Never threatened in Stableford (led 12 holes, never led after any round). This is what peak efficiency looks likeâ€”dominate one competition entirely, finish respectably in the other, go home with hardware.

## Jon BAKER - 4th (Stableford: 146 pts, +22) | 2nd (Gross: 77 strokes, +10)

Jon Baker spent TEG 9 proving that you can lead after Round 1 and still finish fourth. It's a masterclass in squandering early promise.

**The Opening Statement:** Round 1's 39 points led the tournament. Jon opened strong, looked threatening, and briefly suggested he might trouble Patterson's debut coronation. Then he remembered he was Jon.

**The Fade:** After leading by 1 after Round 1, Baker posted 37-34-36 points across the final three rounds. Not terrible. Not good enough. The kind of golf that earns you fourth place and a participation trophy.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 5th (Stableford: 143 pts, +25) | 4th (Gross: 115 strokes, +48)

Gregg Williams posted 143 Stableford points across four rounds without recording a single birdie. ZERO. Not one. This is golf's equivalent of writing a novel without using the letter 'e'â€”technically possible, impressively difficult, utterly pointless.

**The Birdie Drought:** 72 holes. Zero birdies. Gregg treated birdies like mythical creaturesâ€”rumored to exist, occasionally spotted by others, never actually encountered personally. He went an entire tournament without once playing a hole better than par.

**The Consistency:** 31-36-38-38 Stableford points. Gregg improved each round with the drama of watching grass grow. Started poorly, finished respectably, never threatened. It's the scoring progression of someone who read the assignment, understood the assignment, decided "fifth place will do nicely."

## Stuart NEUMANN - 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 127 pts, +41) | 5th (Gross: 125 strokes, +58)

Stuart Neumann collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 127 Stableford points, an improvement of 27 points from last year's catastrophic 100-point disaster. This is what progress looks like when you start from rock bottomâ€”technically better, still comprehensively last.

**The Improvement:** From 100 points (TEG 8) to 127 points (TEG 9). Twenty-seven points better! Still 16 points behind fifth place. It's like celebrating a promotion from "terrible" to "merely bad."

**The Opening Disaster:** Round 1 posted 23 points and eight triple-bogeys-or-worse. EIGHT. Stuartparticipated in what can only be described as synchronized golfing incompetence with Royal Ã“bidos, discovering that some courses have teeth and will bite you repeatedly.
