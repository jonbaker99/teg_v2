# TEG 14 - Player Profiles

---

## David MULLIN - 1st (Stableford: 154 pts, **3rd Trophy**) | 1st (Gross: 58 strokes, **10th Green Jacket**)

After three consecutive wooden spoons, David Mullin returned to claim both trophies with wire-to-wire dominance. Led after every round in both competitions. Won all four gross rounds. Posted two 4+ point holes on the same hole in consecutive rounds. The king didn't just returnâ€”he reminded everyone why he'd been king in the first place.

**The Wire-to-Wire Masterclass:** One hundred fifty-four Stableford points won by 4 over Gregg. Fifty-eight strokes over par won gross by 10. David led after Round 1, extended his lead in Round 2, dominated in Round 3, cruised home in Round 4. This wasn't dramaticâ€”this was systematic destruction.

**The Two 4-Pointers on H18:** Round 2, Hole 18: 4+ Stableford points. Round 3, Hole 18: 4+ Stableford points. David found the same hole on consecutive days and played it brilliantly twice. That's not luckâ€”that's David remembering he could be excellent when necessary.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd (Stableford: 150 pts, +4) | 2nd (Gross: 68 strokes, +10)

Gregg Williams posted 150 Stableford pointsâ€”his fourth runner-up finishâ€”and still lost by 4 to David's wire-to-wire dominance. One hundred fifty points would've won several tournaments. At TEG 14, it secured comfortable second place and continued proof that Gregg is TEG's best player who rarely wins.

**The Fourth Silver Medal:** Runner-up at TEG 10, 11, 12, and now 14. Gregg has perfected the art of finishing second. Four runner-up finishes across five tournaments is consistency nobody wants.

**The Rounds:** 32-35-37-46. Started slowly, improved gradually, finished brilliantly with 46 points. That finale was Gregg's best-ever round. Also utterly irrelevantâ€”David had already won by then.

## Jon BAKER - 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 125 pts, +29) | 3rd (Gross: 78 strokes, +20)

Jon Baker won three consecutive doubles (TEG 11-13), then collected his first wooden spoon with 125 Stableford points. The fall from dominance was swift, complete, and exactly what David experienced in reverse. Golf's cruelest joke: what goes up must come down, preferably dramatically.

**The Wooden Spoon:** One hundred twenty-five points, last place by 2 points behind fifth. Jon never led a single hole in either competition, never threatened the leaders, spent four days being comprehensively outplayed by everyone, especially David.

**The Role Reversal:**
- David: Three wooden spoons â†’ Double champion
- Jon: Three doubles â†’ Wooden spoon

## Alex BAKER - 4th (Stableford: 123 pts, +31) | 5th (Gross: 93 strokes, +35)

Alex Baker finished fourth with 123 Stableford points, which is becoming his signature placement. Mid-table mediocrity executed with professional consistency.

**The Rounds:** 31-31-31-30. Three identical 31-point rounds followed by a 30-point finale. Alex treated consistency like a religion, worshipping at the altar of "exactly adequate."

**Never Threatened:** Fourth after Round 1. Fourth after Round 2. Fourth after Round 3. Fourth at the finish. Alex spent TEG 14 occupying fourth place with the permanence of geological features.

## Henry MELLER - 5th (Stableford: 120 pts, +34) | 4th (Gross: 85 strokes, +27)

Henry Meller posted 120 Stableford points to finish fifth, ahead of Jon's wooden spoon, which is probably Henry's greatest achievement at TEG 14.

**The Rounds:** 30-28-30-32. Metronomically mediocre across four rounds. Henry posted scores in the high 20s/low 30s with the consistency of someone who'd given up on excellence and settled for adequacy.

**Beat Jon:** Finished 5 points ahead of Jon's wooden spoon (120-125). Henry's greatest claim to fame is "not finishing last when the three-time defending champion did."

---

## John PATTERSON - 6th (Stableford: 117 pts, +37) | 6th (Gross: 111 strokes, +53)

John Patterson finished sixth with 117 Stableford points, which would be forgettable except it means he beat nobody and lost to everyone, including Jon's wooden spoon performance.

**Wait, Sixth But Not Last?:** The math doesn't math. Six players, sixth place, but Jon got the wooden spoon? Tiebreak rules are mysterious, Patterson is sixth, Jon is last, everyone is confused.

**The Eagle Specialist's Quiet Week:** Patterson scored two of TEG's three eagles ever (TEG 4, TEG 13). At TEG 14, he scored zero eagles, zero moments of brilliance, zero reasons to remember he participated.
