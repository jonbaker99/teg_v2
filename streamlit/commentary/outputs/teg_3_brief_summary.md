Jon Baker claimed his first TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance of stunning authority, leading all seventy-two holes of the tournament en route to a seventeen-point victory over David Mullin. Baker's dominance was total—leading by eight after Round 1, eleven after Round 2, sixteen after Round 3—building an insurmountable advantage despite suffering a quintuple bogey on the final hole of Round 3. Meanwhile, Mullin secured his second Green Jacket with a twelve-stroke gross victory, demonstrating remarkable consistency even as his Stableford scoring couldn't match Baker's high-variance brilliance.

The split champions told the story of a tournament where consistency and volatility produced completely different winners. Mullin's stability—his seven-stroke gross range was the tightest in the field—earned him commanding control of the gross competition, leading sixty-nine of seventy-two holes. Yet that same steadiness left him seventeen points adrift in Stableford, unable to capitalize on scoring opportunities the way Baker did. The disconnect reached its extreme with Stuart Newman, who finished second in gross scoring but collected the Wooden Spoon after placing fifth in Stableford, twenty-nine points behind Baker despite being just twelve strokes behind Mullin.

The tournament descended into disaster territory with fifty-eight zero-point holes across four rounds, as players battled Boavista's challenges with wildly mixed results. Henry Meller captured the paradox perfectly in Round 3: back-to-back birdies on holes eleven and twelve, sandwiched between a quintuple bogey on hole three and a triple bogey on hole ten—four points one moment, zero the next, embodying the chaos that defined the week.
