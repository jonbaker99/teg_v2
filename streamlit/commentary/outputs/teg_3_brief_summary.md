Jon Baker claimed his first TEG Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance in the 2010 Algarve tournament, leading all 72 holes and extending his margin every round—from 8 to 11 to 16 to 17 points. His volatile brilliance (ranging from 36 to 45 Stableford points across four rounds at Boavista) contrasted sharply with David Mullin's metronomic consistency, as Mullin captured his second Green Jacket with a 12-stroke gross victory, leading 69 of 72 holes. The split champions told the story of a tournament divided between net and gross supremacy.

The most remarkable paradox belonged to Stuart Neumann, who finished second in the gross competition (+84) yet earned his first Wooden Spoon by placing last in Stableford (135 points). Henry Meller's tournament epitomized the fine margins between brilliance and calamity—his four birdies were overshadowed by catastrophic collapses including a twelve on the par-four 17th in Round 1 and a ten on the par-five 3rd in Round 3. Gregg Williams endured eleven blow-ups for zero points, finishing 55 strokes behind Mullin in the gross standings.

Baker's consistency of dominance proved more valuable than his round-to-round volatility, while Mullin's tight scoring range (35-40 Stableford, 14-21 gross per round) showcased a different path to victory. The consecutive Algarve tournament reinforced Boavista's challenge, though no one threatened the course record gross of 75.
