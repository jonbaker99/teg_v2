# TEG 15 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 15*

---

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Finally Champion"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 157 pts, **1st Trophy after 5 runner-ups**) | 1st (Gross: 48 strokes, **1st Green Jacket**)
**Breakthrough:** Runner-up at TEG 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 → Champion at TEG 15

### The Review

After five consecutive runner-up finishes across six tournaments, Gregg Williams finally converted silver into gold. One hundred fifty-seven Stableford points won by 7 over defending champion Dave (150). Forty-eight strokes over par won Gross by 10. The perpetual runner-up had become the champion.

**The Five Silver Medals:**
- TEG 10: 2nd, 173 pts (+11 behind Alex's record 184)
- TEG 11: 2nd, 136 pts (+7 behind Jon)
- TEG 12: 2nd, 162 pts (+10 behind Patterson)
- TEG 13: 2nd, 155 pts (+3 behind Jon, closest finish)
- TEG 14: 2nd, 150 pts (+4 behind Dave)

Five runner-up finishes. Five times watching someone else lift trophies. Then TEG 15 arrived, and Gregg finally broke through.

**The Wire-to-Wire (Sort Of):** Led after Round 2 by 1 point over Dave (77-76), extended to 7 points by Round 3, cruised home by 7 in Round 4. Lost Round 1 to Dave, then won Rounds 2-4 in Stableford and all four in Gross. The dominance was thorough once Gregg took control.

**The Gross Masterclass:** Forty-eight strokes over par, 10 ahead of second place. Won all four Gross rounds. Never threatened after Round 1. Gregg treated Gross golf like a formality—show up, dominate, collect jacket.

**The Breakthrough:** After five silver medals, Gregg posted his best-ever TEG performance when it mattered most. One hundred fifty-seven points ranked in his top 3 personally. The timing was perfect.

**Signature Moment:** Taking the lead in Round 2 (77 points) and never surrendering it. When your signature achievement is converting five runner-ups into one championship, you've earned that trophy.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's breakthrough was comprehensive. First double after five runner-ups. Wire-to-wire Gross dominance. Seven-point Stableford victory over the defending champion. Sometimes persistence pays off. Sometimes it takes six tournaments, but it pays off.

**Rating:** 10/10 for finally winning. 10/10 for dominance. 10/10 for ending the runner-up curse.

## David MULLIN - "The Eagle in Defeat"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 150 pts, +7) | 2nd (Gross: 58 strokes, +10)
**Historic Achievement:** THE FOURTH (and final) EVER TEG EAGLE (R2, H15, Par 5)

### The Review

David Mullin holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 2 for eagle—the fourth and final eagle in TEG history through 17 tournaments—and still finished runner-up by 7 points. Across 1,224 holes of golf, only four eagles have been scored. Dave's was the last, and it came in a losing effort.

**The Final Eagle:** Hole 15, Round 2, Portugal. Par 5. Dave holed his second shot for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. The fourth TEG eagle ever. Also the last one scored through TEG 17 (102 more rounds of golf followed with zero eagles).

**The Four Eagles in History:**
1. Jon Baker (TEG 4, R4 H8, par 4)
2. Stuart Neumann (TEG 12, R4 H15, par 5)
3. John Patterson (TEG 13, R4 H2, par 5) - Patterson's 2nd
4. David Mullin (TEG 15, R2 H15, par 5) - **THE LAST EVER**

Four eagles across 1,224 holes (17 tournaments). Dave owns the final one. Patterson owns two. Everyone else owns one. Eagles are TEG's rarest achievement, and Dave scored the last.

**The Tournament:** One hundred fifty points finished 7 behind Gregg. Dave led after Round 1 (43 points), briefly after Round 2 (76 total, before Gregg posted 77), then watched Gregg pull away in Rounds 3-4. That eagle in Round 2 kept Dave competitive. Gregg's relentless grinding pulled him clear.

**Runner-Up After Winning:** One tournament after claiming the double wire-to-wire, Dave finished second. The defending champion couldn't defend, but he made history trying.

**Signature Moment:** That par 5 eagle on Hole 15. Dave will always own "the final TEG eagle." That's worth more than most runner-up finishes.

**Overall Assessment:** Dave finished second with 150 points and the final TEG eagle. Sometimes you make history and still lose. Sometimes holing a par 5 from the fairway isn't enough when someone else is being relentlessly better across 72 holes.

**Rating:** 10/10 for that final eagle. 8/10 for runner-up. 10/10 for making history in defeat.

## Jon BAKER - "The Solid Fourth"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 144 pts, +13) | 3rd (Gross: 67 strokes, +19)

### The Review

Jon Baker finished fourth with 144 Stableford points one tournament after collecting his first wooden spoon. The recovery from last to fourth is technically improvement, even if fourth in a five-player field is still closer to last than first.

**The Rounds:** 37-37-35-35. Metronomically mediocre across four rounds. Jon posted identical scores in pairs (37-37, 35-35), suggesting he'd found his level and decided staying there was acceptable.

**Never Threatened:** Fourth after Round 1. Third after Round 2. Fourth after Rounds 3-4. Jon spent the tournament oscillating between third and fourth, never threatening the podium, never risking the wooden spoon.

**The Gross Bronze:** Third place, 19 strokes behind Gregg. Jon won zero rounds in either competition, never led, spent four days being professionally adequate while more interesting things happened elsewhere.

**Recovery from Last:** One tournament after the wooden spoon, Jon posted 144 points and fourth place. This is what redemption looks like when your ambitions have been appropriately lowered.

**Signature Moment:** Those identical scoring pairs (37-37, 35-35). When your signature achievement is mathematical consistency at a mediocre level, you're not making headlines.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's fourth-place finish was earned through four rounds of professional mediocrity. One hundred forty-four points, zero threats to the leaders, solid recovery from wooden spoon. Sometimes not finishing last is all you can manage.

**Rating:** 6/10 for recovering from WS. 5/10 for fourth place. 3/10 for being memorable.

## Henry MELLER - "The Fifth Place Specialist"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 137 pts, +20) | 4th (Gross: 74 strokes, +26)

### The Review

Henry Meller posted 137 Stableford points to finish fifth, which is becoming his natural habitat. Not wooden spoon, not podium, just perpetually fifth.

**The Rounds:** 35-34-35-33. Henry treated consistency like a religion, posting scores in the mid-30s with the reliability of geological processes. Started fifth, stayed fifth, finished fifth.

**Never Threatened Anything:** Fifth after every round. Henry spent the tournament exactly where everyone predicted he'd be: mid-table mediocrity with zero drama.

**Beat Alex:** Finished 4 points ahead of Alex's wooden spoon (137-133). Henry's greatest achievement is "not finishing last," which is setting the bar appropriately low and still barely clearing it.

**Signature Moment:** Being fifth after every round. When your signature achievement is perfect consistency at fifth place, you've found your level and accepted it.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry's fifth-place finish was earned through four rounds of forgettable golf that happened to be slightly better than Alex's disaster. Sometimes your greatest achievement is occupying mid-table with zero variation.

**Rating:** 5/10 for everything. Literally everything. Fifth place in ratings, appropriately.

## Alex BAKER - "The Wooden Spoon Collector"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 133 pts, +24) | 5th (Gross: 84 strokes, +36)

### The Review

Alex Baker collected the wooden spoon with 133 Stableford points one tournament after brother Jon did the same. The Baker brothers had achieved synchronized failure: Jon (TEG 14 WS), Alex (TEG 15 WS). Family traditions include holidays, recipes, and apparently wooden spoons.

**The Baker Brothers' Spoon Collection:**
- Jon: TEG 14 wooden spoon (125 pts)
- Alex: TEG 15 wooden spoon (133 pts)

Consecutive tournaments, consecutive Baker wooden spoons. The family that finishes last together stays together, presumably commiserating over which brother is more disappointing.

**The Rounds:** 35-33-32-33. Alex started adequately, faded gradually, finished poorly. The scoring progression of someone who showed up, participated half-heartedly, collected last place.

**Never Contended:** Fifth after Round 1. Fifth after every subsequent round. Alex spent the tournament occupying last place with the permanence of furniture.

**Four Points Behind Fourth:** Alex finished 4 points behind Henry's fifth place (137-133). The wooden spoon was earned through sustained mediocrity rather than dramatic collapse.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting the wooden spoon one tournament after Jon did. When your signature achievement is maintaining family traditions through synchronized failure, golf is mocking your entire bloodline.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex's wooden spoon was earned through four rounds of professional mediocrity that happened to be worse than everyone else's mediocrity. The Baker brothers had traded wooden spoons like cursed heirlooms. Jon got his, Alex got his, the family traditions continue.

**Rating:** 3/10 for performance. 2/10 for avoiding last. 10/10 for brotherly synchronization.
