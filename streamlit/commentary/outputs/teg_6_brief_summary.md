# TEG 6 - Brief Summary

Gregg Williams claimed his first TEG Trophy at PGA Catalunya with 145 points (net vs par), leading wire-to-wire despite getting progressively worse each round. His opening 48-point salvo established a 4-point cushion that survived a steady decline through 36, 33, and 28 points in subsequent rounds. The backwards victory was sealed by just 3 points over Jon Baker, who closed from 4 back to 3 behind but ran out of rounds to complete the comeback.

Jon's 142 points and second place marked another near-miss, while Stuart Neumann's workmanlike 139 points secured bronze. The tournament's compelling subplot saw Dave Mullin finish fourth in the net competition (135 points) yet claim his fifth consecutive Green Jacket through dominant gross scoringâ€”the Dave Mullin paradox minus the wooden spoon this time.

Henry Meller collected the wooden spoon with 123 points, 22 behind Gregg's winning total. PGA Catalunya hosted its first TEG with the net vs par format still in place (Stableford scoring would arrive at TEG 8). Gregg's first trophy was earned through the simple strategy of starting brilliantly and declining slowly enough that "worse" remained better than everyone else's "mediocre."
