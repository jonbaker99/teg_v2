# TEG 14: Mullin's Magnificent Sweep

David Mullin claimed his third TEG Trophy and tenth Green Jacket with a wire-to-wire demolition that left the field gasping for oxygen. His 154-point triumph, sealed by margins of two points in Stableford and seven strokes gross, represented the most commanding victory in recent TEG memory. Mullin led after all four rounds in both competitions—a feat of sustained excellence that saw him control 60 of 72 holes in Stableford scoring and an astonishing 70 of 72 in gross. Back-to-back 40-point performances in the opening rounds effectively settled the Trophy race before most players had unpacked their waterproofs.

Yet the tournament's most compelling narrative belonged to Jon Baker, whose spectacular paradox will echo through TEG folklore for years. Five birdies—joint-tournament-leading with Mullin—alongside eleven zero-point disasters delivered Baker his first career Wooden Spoon. This wasn't merely bad golf punctuated by brilliance; it was a statistical impossibility made flesh. Baker's final-round resurrection, featuring four birdies and a course-record 83 gross, arrived far too late to salvage dignity from the wreckage of three preceding disasters. The Spoon, once unthinkable for a player capable of such quality, was already polished and waiting.

Alex Baker's tournament will haunt him differently. His 43-point final round—the tournament's best—slashed Mullin's lead from eight points to just two in a desperate charge that fell agonizingly short. The gap that couldn't quite be closed traced directly to hole sixteen, where Baker's catastrophic sextuple-bogey (+6) in Round 4 single-handedly extinguished his Trophy hopes. Leading 15 of 72 holes suggested capability; losing his Round 1 lead on hole eleven to Mullin's birdie at ten foretold the narrative arc. When Baker's quintuple-bogey at sixteen in the opening round yielded zero points, the script was already written.

Gregg Williams played the role of steady antagonist throughout, his consistent bogey golf (137 points, +76 gross) securing third place without threatening the leaders. In a tournament starved of birdies—just nine across 288 holes—Williams's par-grinding pragmatism looked positively sensible. Meanwhile, Mullin never scored worse than 36 points in any round, his relentless consistency the foundation of a victory that never truly felt in doubt after those opening forties.

## Round 1: The Quintuple Catastrophe

Royal Cinque Ports opened its account with characteristic cruelty, immediately establishing the tournament's narrative hierarchy. Mullin's early supremacy seemed preordained: a birdie at the tenth handed him both leads simultaneously, though he'd briefly surrendered gross advantage after a disaster at seven. By the eleventh, when Alex Baker stumbled into a quadruple-bogey disaster, Mullin seized Stableford control and never relinquished it.

Baker's round disintegrated spectacularly at sixteen, where a quintuple-bogey zero carved a wound that would never fully heal. That catastrophic hole, coupled with the eleventh's implosion, buried him in a three-point deficit to Mullin. Jon Baker endured his own torments—disasters at three and five yielded a miserable opening stretch that left him ten points adrift in a round where pars felt like victories. Williams's disaster at three set the tone for his tournament: respectable suffering without the extremes of brilliance or collapse.

Mullin's 40-point opener, anchored by that pivotal birdie at ten and bolstered by a strong back-nine performance (24 points versus 16 on the front), established the tournament's pecking order. Alex Baker's 37 points kept him second, but the quintuple-bogey's psychological damage ran deeper than the scorecard suggested. Williams (33 points) and Jon Baker (29 points) already looked beaten, the latter's nine-point back-nine revival insufficient to compensate for his opening disaster sequence.

## Round 2: Extending the Empire

Littlestone witnessed Mullin transform a comfortable advantage into an impregnable fortress. His second consecutive 41-point performance, featuring birdies at seven and eighteen, stretched his Trophy lead to nine points. The eighteen birdie punctuated his dominance with theatrical timing—a strong finisher (23 points on the back nine) ensuring his rivals understood their predicament.

Alex Baker's challenge imploded across holes three through eight, where back-to-back disasters at five (quadruple-bogey) and eight (another quadruple-bogey) yielded consecutive zeros. This brutal six-hole stretch averaged +2.5 versus par, a statistical catastrophe that left Baker 29 strokes over par gross and bleeding points. Five disasters in a single round reduced him to 35 points, extending Mullin's lead by six despite Baker rallying for 21 points on the back nine.

Jon Baker and Williams traded misery at different ends of the competence spectrum. Jon Baker's 29 points—matching his opening round—kept him anchored in fourth, his disaster at seven continuing a pattern of isolated implosions. Williams slumped to 27 points after disasters at one, thirteen, fifteen, and sixteen turned respectable holes into four zero-point catastrophes. Mullin's cumulative 81 points after two rounds looked insurmountable because it was.

**After Round 2:** DM 81pts (+29), AB 72pts (+55), GW 60pts (+47), JB 58pts (+41)

## Round 3: Williams Roars, Baker Implodes

Prince's Shore/Dunes course staged the tournament's most intriguing round as Gregg Williams surged into contention with a superb 39-point performance that elevated him to second overall. His consistent par sequences—holes nine through eleven witnessed three consecutive pars—showcased the steady excellence that had eluded others. Williams's 14-stroke gross round represented the day's finest ball-striking, a beacon of competence in treacherous conditions.

Mullin's lead contracted to eight points despite his workmanlike 36-point effort, though he never truly lost control. Disasters at seven and eight (consecutive +3 and +4) briefly threatened his authority, but a closing birdie at eighteen—his trademark strong finish (23 back-nine points)—reasserted dominance. He'd led every single hole of the round in both competitions, a wire-to-wire display that made Sunday's finale feel like coronation rather than contest.

Jon Baker's round descended into carnival grotesquery: five disasters, the tournament's highest single-round total, scattered across holes four, six, eleven, thirteen, and seventeen like landmines in a minefield. Yet somehow he struck a birdie at two—a tantalizing glimpse of competence immediately swallowed by chaos. His 28-point implosion dropped him behind Williams into third, the Wooden Spoon's shadow lengthening with each zero-point hole. Alex Baker's 37 points included disasters at ten and sixteen, the latter foreshadowing Sunday's catastrophe at that cursed hole.

**After Round 3:** DM 117pts (+49), GW 99pts (+61), JB 86pts (+64), AB 109pts (+80)

## Round 4: Baker's Glorious Futility

The Prince's Shore/Dunes finale delivered Alex Baker's finest hour and cruelest heartbreak in equal measure. His 43-point masterclass—the tournament's best round—featured imperious sequences like holes thirteen through fifteen (11 points) and a dominant front nine (24 points). The gap to Mullin, eight points entering Sunday, shrank to just two in a charge that briefly suggested the impossible. Then came hole sixteen.

Baker's catastrophic sextuple-bogey (+6) at sixteen—the same hole that had yielded a quintuple in Round 1—obliterated his Trophy hopes in seconds. The disaster, worth zero points and six strokes over par, epitomized golf's savage indifference to narrative. His cold spell from holes ten through twelve, averaging +2.33 versus par with a disaster at twelve, had already softened his assault. But sixteen delivered the killing blow, reducing his magnificent round to a monument of what might have been.

Mullin's 37-point cruise home included a disaster at ten (quadruple-bogey) that momentarily flickered danger before evaporating. His 19-stroke gross round secured the Green Jacket by seven strokes, cementing wire-to-wire dominance in both competitions. The two-point Stableford margin somehow felt more comfortable than the mathematics suggested—Mullin had led after every round, controlled 70 of 72 holes gross, and never truly looked vulnerable.

Jon Baker's final act defied comprehension. Four birdies—at two, six, twelve, and thirteen—produced golf of genuine quality, his course-record 83 gross (+11) representing the round's finest striking. Yet three disasters, including a closing quadruple-bogey at eighteen, ensured his 39 points merely decorated the Wooden Spoon. This wasn't bad golf rescuing itself; it was schizophrenic brilliance unable to escape its own disasters. Five tournament-leading birdies alongside eleven zero-point holes created a statistical paradox for the ages: Jon Baker, course-record holder and Wooden Spoon recipient, a player simultaneously elite and catastrophic.

**Final Scores:** DM 154pts (+68), AB 152pts (+102), GW 137pts (+76), JB 125pts (+75)

## Tournament Recap

David Mullin's third TEG Trophy and tenth Green Jacket arrived via the tournament's most comprehensive dominance in memory. Wire-to-wire victories in both competitions, achieved by leading 60 of 72 Stableford holes and 70 of 72 gross, left no doubt about his supremacy. Back-to-back 40-point openers established authority; consistent excellence across four rounds—never worse than 36 points—maintained it. In an event starved of birdies, Mullin's four conversions matched Jon Baker's five while avoiding the latter's eleven disasters. That contrast defined everything.

Alex Baker's tournament exists in the agonizing space between brilliance and disaster. His 43-point final round closed an eight-point gap to two, suggesting genuine championship quality. Yet catastrophes at hole sixteen—quintuple in Round 1, sextuple in Round 4—cost him perhaps twelve points across two holes. The Trophy's two-point margin traces directly to that cursed par-four, where Baker's demons gathered for their convention. His 152 points represented excellent golf undermined by specific, repeated failures at critical moments.

Jon Baker's first Wooden Spoon defies rational analysis. Five birdies—only Mullin matched him—and a course-record 83 gross in the finale showcase genuine skill. But eleven zero-point disasters across four rounds tell the fuller story: a player oscillating wildly between competence and chaos, incapable of avoiding the catastrophic stretches that accumulated into ignominy. The paradox will endure: joint birdie leader, course-record holder, Wooden Spoon recipient. In TEG history, there's never been another quite like it. Mullin swept everything while Baker somehow both excelled and failed spectacularly, a tournament defined by dominance at the top and delicious contradiction at the bottom.
