# TEG 14 Tournament Report: The King Returns

After three consecutive wooden spoons, David Mullin returned to claim both trophies with 154 Stableford points and 58 strokes over par. The wire-to-wire dominanceâ€”leading after every single round in both competitionsâ€”announced that the dynasty, while dormant, had not died.

Meanwhile, Jon Baker collected his first wooden spoon with 125 points after winning three consecutive doubles. The complete role reversal was golf's cruelest joke: Dave (three wooden spoons to double champion), Jon (three doubles to wooden spoon).

And Dave did it with style: two 4+ point holes on Hole 18â€”one in Round 2, one in Round 3. Same hole on consecutive days, same brilliance. The grinder had rediscovered the ability to be occasionally excellent.

## Dave's Redemption Complete

One hundred fifty-four Stableford points won by 4 over Gregg Williams (150). Fifty-eight strokes over par won Gross by 10 over second place. Dave led after every round in both competitions, winning all four rounds in Gross and three of four in Stableford. This wasn't closeâ€”this was comprehensive.

The two 4+ point holes: Round 2, Hole 18 (4+ points). Round 3, Hole 18 (4+ points). Dave found the same hole on consecutive days and played it brilliantly twice. That's not luckâ€”that's pattern recognition combined with execution.

Four years since Dave's last trophy (TEG 10, 2017). Four years since his last Green Jacket. Three wooden spoons in the interim. Then TEG 14 arrived, and Dave remembered who he used to be.

Third TEG Trophy. Tenth Green Jacket. The king had returned.

## Jon's First Wooden Spoon

Jon Baker finished last with 125 Stableford points, two points behind fifth place. After winning three consecutive doubles (TEG 11-13), Jon collected his first wooden spoon. The fall from dominance was swift, complete, and utterly unexpected.

One hundred twenty-five points would've been competitive in some tournaments. At TEG 14, it secured last place while Dave reasserted dominance. Jon never led a single hole in either competition, never threatened the leaders, spent four days being comprehensively outplayed.

From three doubles to one wooden spoon. Golf giveth championships, golf taketh away dignity. Jon had dominated TEG for three years. Then Dave showed up with two 4-point holes on the same hole in consecutive rounds and reminded everyone who owned the dynasty.

## Gregg's Fourth Runner-Up

Gregg Williams posted 150 Stableford points and finished 4 points behind Daveâ€”his fourth runner-up finish. Led briefly in Round 1 (tied with Dave and Jon at 33 after 9 holes), then watched Dave pull away and never look back.

One hundred fifty points would've won several tournaments. At TEG 14, it secured comfortable second place and the knowledge that when Dave is on form, everyone else is playing for silver. Gregg's fourth runner-up finish confirmed his status as TEG's best player who rarely wins.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Dave 36 leads, Jon 33, Gregg 32, Alex 31, Henry 30, John 28

**Round 2:** Dave 78 (extends to +9), Gregg 67, Jon 65, Alex 62, Henry/John 58/57. Dave's first 4+ point hole (H18)

**Round 3:** Dave 115 (dominates by +11), Gregg 104, Jon 100, Alex/Henry/John 93/88/88. Dave's second 4+ point hole (H18 again!)

**Round 4:** Dave 154 (seals double by 4), Gregg 150, Jon 125 (WS by 2), Alex 123, Henry 120, John 117

## The Verdict

TEG 14 delivered Dave Mullin's redemption: 154 Stableford points and 58 strokes over par, both won wire-to-wire with comprehensive dominance. Three wooden spoons erased with one double victory. Two 4+ point holes on the same hole in consecutive rounds (R2 & R3, H18) demonstrated Dave could still produce moments of brilliance.

Jon Baker's wooden spoon (125 points, last by 2) ended his three-tournament reign with the kind of dramatic reversal golf specializes in. From three doubles to one spoon in one tournament. The dynasty changed hands.

Gregg's runner-up (150 points, 4 behind) marked his fourth second-place finish. Alex's fourth (123 points), Henry's fifth (120 points), and Patterson's sixth (117 points) completed the field.

The king had returned. The crown was reclaimed. Dave's 10th Green Jacket and 3rd TEG Trophy confirmed the wooden spoons were an anomaly, not a new reality.
