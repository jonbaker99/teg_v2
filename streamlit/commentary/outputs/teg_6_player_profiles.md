# TEG 6 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 6*

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Backwards Champion"

**Final Position:** 1st (Net vs Par: 145 pts) | 3rd (Gross)

### The Review

Gregg Williams won his first TEG Trophy by discovering a revolutionary strategy: start brilliantly, then decline steadily while hoping nobody notices.

**The Opening Statement:** Forty-eight points in Round 1. FORTY-EIGHT. That's not golf; that's a mic drop. A 4-point lead established. Trophy trajectory: set. Champagne: on ice.

**The Decline:** Then came Rounds 2, 3, and 4: 36, 33, 28. Each round worse than the last. Gregg didn't so much win as gradually stop winning less badly than Jon. By Round 4, Gregg was posting 28 pointsâ€”his worst roundâ€”and somehow that was enough because he'd built such a cushion with that absurd opener.

**The Wire-to-Wire:** Led after every round despite getting worse every round. That takes commitment to nervous mediocrity.

**The Math:** Won by 3 points. Started with a 4-point lead. Somehow managed to lose 1 point of advantage while leading the entire way. That's Gregg Williams efficiency.

**Signature Moment:** Round 1's 48-point explosion. When your signature achievement is "used up all my golf in 18 holes and coasted," you're Gregg Williams.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's first TEG Trophy was earned through the strategy of early dominance and managed decline. Forty-eight became 28. Lead became smaller lead became smallest lead became victory by 3. First trophy: achieved. Method: questionable.

**Rating:** 10/10 for R1. 5/10 for R2-4. 10/10 for winning while getting progressively worse.

## Jon BAKER - "The Nearly Man (Again)"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Net vs Par: 142 pts, +3) | 2nd (Gross)

### The Review

Jon Baker spent TEG 6 doing what Jon does best: threatening to win while ultimately finishing second.

**The Chase:** Started 4 points behind after Gregg's ridiculous R1. Closed to 3 points behind by the finish. Progress! Insufficient progress, but progress.

**The Rounds:** 44-40-32-26. That's not a comeback; that's a gradual acceptance of defeat. Jon peaked in R2 (40 points) and then declined faster than Gregg declined, which is the only reason Gregg won.

**The Final Round:** Twenty-six points. Jon needed to outscore Gregg by more than 3. Posted 26 to Gregg's 28. Lost by... 3. Mathematics: cruel. Jon: second. Again.

**Signature Moment:** Closing from 4 back to 3 back and running out of rounds. When your signature achievement is "almost caught him," you're Jon Baker finishing second.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's runner-up finish was earned through the strategy of chasing Gregg's declining scores with his own declining scores, except declining slightly faster. Second place, 3 points behind, zero trophies. The Jon Baker special when not actually winning.

**Rating:** 7/10 for trying. 4/10 for closing the gap. 0/10 for actually winning.

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Bronze Standard"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Net vs Par: 139 pts, +6) | 4th (Gross)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann claimed bronze with 139 points through the time-honored Stu strategy: be present, be competent, be forgettable.

**The Rounds:** 37-36-35-31. That's descending mediocrity with remarkable consistency. Stu started mediocre and got slightly worse, which was good enough for third because everyone else also got worse.

**The Gap:** Six points behind Gregg. Never threatened. Never close. Just... there. Occupying third place like someone occupying a seat on the bus.

**Signature Moment:** Posting 37-36-35-31 and finishing exactly where you'd expect Stu to finish. When your signature achievement is "predictable mediocrity," you're Stu Neumann.

**Overall Assessment:** Stu's bronze medal was earned through professional-grade mediocrity. Not good enough to threaten. Not bad enough to embarrass. Just the right amount of "meh" to claim third. The Stu Neumann guarantee.

**Rating:** 5/10 for performance. 3/10 for excitement. 10/10 for being exactly who we expected.

## David MULLIN - "The Fifth Jacket"

**Final Position:** 4th (Net vs Par: 135 pts, +10) | 1st (Gross, **Green Jacket**)

### The Review

David Mullin finished fourth in the net competition and collected his fifth consecutive Green Jacket because gross scoring doesn't care about your net position.

**The Net Reality:** One hundred thirty-five points. Fourth place. Ten behind Gregg. Thoroughly beaten in the actual competition.

**The Gross Truth:** Won the Green Jacket. Fifth consecutive. Dominant gross scoring from a fourth-place net finish. This is Dave's entire brand: win the competition that matters to Dave while losing the one everyone else is playing.

**The Streak:** Fifth consecutive Green Jacket. At this point it's not dominance; it's a lifestyle. Dave collects Green Jackets like some people collect stamps.

**Signature Moment:** Finishing fourth and collecting a Green Jacket. When your signature achievement is "won a different competition," you're Dave Mullin.

**Overall Assessment:** Dave's fifth consecutive Green Jacket came via the familiar route: finish fourth in net, dominate gross, collect trophy. The streak continues. The Dave Mullin paradox persists.

**Rating:** 4/10 for net. 10/10 for Green Jacket. 10/10 for five-year streak.

## Henry MELLER - "The Wooden Spoon Collector"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Net vs Par: 123 pts, +22) | 5th (Gross)

### The Review

Henry Meller collected the wooden spoon with 123 points, finishing 22 behind Gregg's winning total and comprehensively last.

**The Numbers:** 28-31-34-30. That's not progress; that's random variation around "bad." Henry peaked in Round 3 (34 points) when it absolutely didn't matter, then declined to 30 in R4 because why not.

**The Margin:** Twenty-two points behind Gregg. Not close. Not threatening. Just distant last, the way Henry does it.

**Signature Moment:** Finishing last in both net and gross. When your signature achievement is "comprehensive failure in all formats," you're Henry Meller at TEG 6.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry's wooden spoon was earned through consistent incompetence across all four rounds. Last in net, last in gross. No ambiguity. No paradoxes. Just straightforward, honest failure.

**Rating:** 2/10 for performance. 1/10 for threatening anyone. 10/10 for unambiguous last place.
