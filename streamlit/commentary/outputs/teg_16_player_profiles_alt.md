# TEG 16 - Player Profiles

---

## Stuart NEUMANN - 1st (Stableford: 156 pts, **ONLY TROPHY EVER**) | 4th (Gross: 71 strokes)

Stuart Neumann won his only TEG Trophy with 156 Stableford points, beating Gregg Williams by 3 in a nail-biter. Wire-to-wire dominance (led after every round), tight finish, only championship. Stuart peaked at TEG 16, claimed his trophy, then spent TEG 17 proving it was a fluke.

Twelve tournaments played. One trophy won (TEG 16). One eagle scored (TEG 12, the second ever). One moment of excellence in a career otherwise defined by mid-table mediocrity. Sometimes that's enough.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd (Stableford: 153 pts, +3) | 1st (Gross: 37 strokes, **2nd Green Jacket**)

Gregg Williams finished runner-up for the sixth time (153 points, 3 behind Stuart), then won his second consecutive Green Jacket from that second-place finish. The David Mullin paradox had found its new master.

Sixth runner-up finish. Second jacket from non-first Stableford. Gregg had perfected the art of losing one competition while winning the other.

## Jon BAKER - 3rd (Stableford: 148 pts, +8) | 2nd (Gross: 41 strokes)

Jon Baker posted 148 points for bronze, which is perfectly respectable and utterly forgettable when Stuart's winning his only trophy and Gregg's perfecting paradoxes.

## David MULLIN - 4th (Stableford: 141 pts, +15) | 3rd (Gross: 53 strokes)

David Mullin finished fourth with 141 points, his worst non-wooden-spoon finish in years. The dynasty that had dominated TEG for nine years was fading into comfortable mediocrity.

## Alex BAKER - 5th (**2nd consecutive Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 127 pts, +29) | 5th (Gross: 88 strokes)

Alex Baker collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 127 points, 14 behind fourth place. Back-to-back spoons confirmed TEG 15 wasn't an anomalyâ€”Alex had found his level, and it was last.

TEG 15: wooden spoon. TEG 16: wooden spoon. Consecutive last-place finishes. The Baker family wooden spoon collection was growing.
