# TEG 15: Williams's Historic Wire-to-Wire Sweep on the Lisbon Coast

## Tournament Summary

Gregg Williams claimed his third TEG Trophy and maiden Green Jacket in ruthless fashion, sweeping both competitions with a wire-to-wire dominance that rewrote the tournament record books. Leading for 69 of 72 holes in the Stableford and 64 of 72 in gross scoring, Williams won by historic margins—21 points in the Trophy and a staggering 29 strokes in the Jacket—completing his collection after two previous Trophy wins with the casual brutality of a man playing a different sport.

His coronation came on Portugal's Lisbon Coast, where the TEG returned after a six-year absence to play a quartet of courses including two debutantes. While Williams posted a career-best even-par 10 in Round 3 at Penha Longa and systematically dismantled all challengers, the real drama unfolded in his wake. Stuart Neumann, entering with zero Trophy wins to his name, produced the tournament's great revelation—a career-best runner-up finish built on relentless consistency (four rounds from 26-43 points) that defied his complete absence of birdies. Jon Baker's challenge imploded spectacularly in Round 1 after early promise, his consecutive disasters on holes 11-12 triggering a 22-point collapse. John Patterson, holding second place through Round 2, saw his defense crater with a quintuple bogey on Round 4's opening hole. And Alex Baker claimed his second career Wooden Spoon with 20 worse-than-doubles scattered across four rounds of sustained misery.

The tournament's defining paradox: Williams's dominance was so complete that five players recording disasters on the 18th hole in the final round couldn't generate the slightest drama. When the man out front is 18 points clear and posting even-par rounds for fun, everyone else is merely playing for minor placings. This was systematic excellence meets competitive carnage—a wire-to-wire masterclass with just enough chaos behind to keep it entertaining.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Baker's Meltdown at Estoril

The tournament opened at Estoril, a new course to the TEG roster, with Jon Baker seizing the early initiative. He took both the gross and Stableford leads on the first hole, projecting the swagger of a man with a plan. Behind him, Williams and Neumann both posted disastrous opening holes (+4 vs par each), immediately ceding four points and raising hopes of genuine competition.

Williams answered swiftly. A birdie on the third hole vaulted him into the lead in both competitions, which he extended with another birdie on the fourth. Baker wrestled back the Stableford lead by the tenth hole, the gap tight, the battle engaged. And then it all went catastrophically wrong. The 11th hole brought a +5 disaster that stripped Baker of both leads and five precious points. The 12th—another +5, another disaster. In the space of two holes, Baker's challenge haemorrhaged 22 points from what could have been, transforming a genuine title tilt into damage limitation. He would add disasters on holes 15 and 17 for good measure, finishing the round in third place with 31 points, ten points adrift of Williams's commanding 39.

The 11th and 12th holes proved democratically cruel—Williams, David Mullin, and Alex Baker all recorded disasters on 12, while Neumann added a +3 on the same hole after his own H15 implosion (+6). Patterson's back nine disasters on holes 8-9 hadn't stopped him claiming second place (34 points), five behind Williams, while Neumann's horror show start (disasters on holes 1 and 3, including a +5 on the third) relegated him to joint third on 31 points alongside Baker.

Williams led by five with 39 points and +17 vs par, his early wobbles forgotten. The gross lead was eight strokes. The question wasn't whether he'd extend it, but whether anyone could stay in touching distance. **Scores after R1: GW 39pts, JP 34pts, JB 31pts, SN 31pts, DM 30pts, AB 30pts**

### Round 2: Mullin's Eagle Can't Shake Williams

West Cliffs, another TEG debutante, provided the venue for Round 2, and Williams immediately set about increasing his advantage. He posted 40 points to extend his Stableford lead to nine and his gross advantage to seven strokes, the kind of margin that transforms "comfortable" into "insurmountable" with 36 holes remaining.

Patterson remained in second place (36 points) thanks to an early birdie on the third hole that briefly lifted him to the Stableford lead before Williams reclaimed it by the fourth. Baker's misery continued—a disaster on the third hole (+4) dropped him from third to fourth, while his cold spell from holes 1-6 (five points total, featuring disasters on holes 1, 3, and 6) set the tone for another difficult day. The sixth hole proved particularly savage: Alex Baker (+6), Mullin (+5), and Neumann (+5) all recorded disasters in a collective implosion.

The round's standout moment belonged to Mullin, who holed out for eagle on the 15th (-2 vs par, five points) to climb from fourth to third. His strong back nine (20 points) contrasted sharply with his front-nine struggles (13 points), and the eagle provided a rare flash of brilliance amid general mediocrity. Not that it mattered to Williams, who brushed off his own disaster on the 15th (+5) to maintain his stranglehold.

Jon Baker rallied with a strong back nine (19 points vs 10 on the front), but he'd already dug too deep a hole with disasters on holes 3, 6, and 7. Stuart Neumann slid from joint third to sixth (26 points) after disasters on holes 13, 14, and 17, while Alex Baker (27 points) continued his own grim march toward the Spoon with disasters on holes 6, 7, 8, and 10.

Williams led by nine points with 79 total. Patterson held second on 70, Mullin third on 63. The trophy race was effectively over; the question now was who'd claim runner-up. **Scores after R2: GW 79pts, JP 70pts, DM 63pts, JB 60pts, AB 57pts, SN 57pts**

### Round 3: Even-Par Dominance at Penha Longa

Penha Longa—previously visited at TEG 8—witnessed Williams's most complete round: 44 points and a stunning even-par 10 that set a new course record and represented his career-best gross score. It was a performance of such control that it broke the tournament open, extending his lead to an unassailable 18 points with one round remaining.

Williams sprinkled four birdies across the round (holes 8, 10, 13, and 15), his hot spell from holes 10-15 producing 18 points including consecutive birdies on 10 and 15. A disaster on the fifth (+3) barely registered as a setback. His mastery was complete: front nine 19 points, back nine 25 points, gross scoring that rendered handicaps almost irrelevant.

Behind him, Stuart Neumann finally delivered. His 43 points—the round's second-best return—lifted him from sixth to fifth overall, a surge built on consistency (25 points on the front nine) rather than fireworks. Jon Baker posted 41 points with a birdie on the 13th, climbing from fourth to fourth overall—yes, you read that correctly. Such was the carnage elsewhere that Baker's solid round merely maintained his position.

Patterson's hold on second place finally slipped despite 35 points, disasters on holes 10 (+4) and 16 (+5) proving costly. Alex Baker managed just 29 points, disasters on holes 12 (quadruple bogey) and 14 (+6, quintuple or worse) highlighting a round of 34 gross that confirmed his Spoon status. His sole birdie of the round on the fifth offered brief respite before the 12th-14th implosion (one point from three holes).

Williams's 18-point lead with one round remaining meant the trophy was wrapped. The battle for second—Neumann, Patterson, Baker all within seven points—offered the final round's only remaining suspense. **Scores after R3: GW 123pts, JP 105pts, DM 103pts, JB 101pts, SN 100pts, AB 86pts**

### Round 4: Patterson's Quintuple Horror at Oitavos Dunes

Oitavos Dunes—revisited from TEG 8—served as the stage for Williams's coronation and Patterson's capitulation. The defining moment came on the opening hole where Patterson recorded a catastrophic quintuple bogey (+6, zero points), a disaster of such magnitude that it torpedoed his defense of second place before the round had properly begun. Alex Baker and Mullin also carded disasters on the first hole (+4 each, zero points), setting the tone for a chaotic finale.

Williams, playing with the freedom of a man already measuring curtains for the trophy cabinet, posted 34 points and 20 gross—his best gross round of the tournament—to secure victory by 21 points in the Stableford and 29 strokes in gross scoring. The sweep was complete, the margins historic, the dominance absolute.

Stuart Neumann seized the moment. His 36 points—the round's best Stableford return—featured 4-point holes on the 5th and 17th that anchored his surge from fifth to second overall. His front nine (21 points) again highlighted his consistency, though a disaster on the 18th (+5, zero points) provided an appropriately brutal finish to a tournament defined by catastrophic holes.

Patterson's quintuple start relegated him to third place overall (30 points), with further disasters on hole 12 merely confirming the damage. Jon Baker (30 points) held fourth, while Mullin's round collapsed entirely. After disasters on holes 1 and 2 limited him to one point from the opening three holes, he never recovered. His 22 points—both a personal worst and the round's poorest return—featured a disaster on the 18th and dropped him from third to fifth overall. For good measure, his 33 gross also set a personal worst, completing a comprehensive implosion.

The 18th hole delivered one final twist: five players recorded disasters (Neumann +5, Mullin +4, Jon Baker +4, Alex Baker +3, Williams +3), a collective meltdown that would have generated drama in any other tournament. Here it merely provided a footnote to Williams's coronation.

**Final Scores: GW 157pts (+63), SN 136pts (+128), JP 135pts (+113), JB 131pts (+92), DM 125pts (+93), AB 114pts (+134)**

## Tournament Recap

Gregg Williams's third Trophy and first Green Jacket arrived with the inevitability of a metronome. Leading for 69 of 72 Stableford holes and 64 of 72 in gross scoring, his dominance admitted no challengers, no narrative tension, no last-day drama. The combined margins—21 points and 29 strokes—represent the largest dual victories in tournament history, a statistical massacre dressed as a golf competition.

Yet the real story played out in the carnage behind him. Stuart Neumann's evolution from zero-time Trophy winner to runner-up showcased the virtue of relentless mediocrity: four rounds between 26-43 points, zero birdies, maximum consistency. Jon Baker's 22-point collapse across two holes in Round 1 proved that lightning can strike twice in succession. John Patterson's quintuple bogey start in Round 4 demonstrated that defending second place requires at least making it past the first hole. And Alex Baker's second Wooden Spoon, earned through 20 worse-than-doubles and the grim determination to find new ways to card disasters, provided the statistical ballast.

Williams completed his collection—three Trophies, one Jacket—with the casual excellence of a man for whom even-par rounds and wire-to-wire victories have become routine. On the Lisbon Coast, six years after the TEG last visited, he reminded everyone what dominance looks like. The rest played for minor honours while he played a different game entirely. Historic margins, flawless execution, and just enough chaos elsewhere to keep it interesting. Mostly.
