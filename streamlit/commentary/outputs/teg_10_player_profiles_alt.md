# TEG 10 - Player Profiles

---

## Alex BAKER - 1st (Stableford: 184 pts, **ALL-TIME RECORD**) | 4th (Gross: 90 strokes, +39)

Alex Baker posted 184 Stableford pointsâ€”the highest score in TEG history through ten tournamentsâ€”to win his only career TEG Trophy. That's right: ONLY. Alex peaked at TEG 10, collected his trophy, then spent the next seven tournaments proving it was an anomaly.

**The Scoring:** 42-42-49-51. Consistent brilliance building to a crescendo. The 51-point finale was the second-best single round ever recorded. Alex dismantled Praia D'El Rey with the ruthless efficiency of someone who'd been taking notes for eight tournaments and finally decided to show off.

**The Wire-to-Wire That Wasn't:** Alex didn't lead after Round 1 (Gregg did). Didn't lead after Round 2 (David did). Took the lead in Round 3 by one point, then destroyed everyone in Round 4 by seven points. Sometimes you don't need to lead wire-to-wire when you can just obliterate the field when it matters.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd (Stableford: 173 pts, +11) | 3rd (Gross: 76 strokes, +25)

Gregg Williams posted the second-best score in TEG history (173 points) and still finished 11 behind the winner. This is golf's version of running a personal best marathon and finishing second to someone who just broke the world record.

**The Rounds:** 48-45-42-38. Gregg started magnificently, then gradually faded like someone running out of enthusiasm. Led after Round 1 with 48 pointsâ€”his best-ever opening roundâ€”then watched Alex remember he could play golf.

**The Birdie Situation:** Four birdies across four rounds. Enough to challenge, not enough to win. Gregg treated birdies like limited edition collectiblesâ€”acquire them occasionally, treasure them, don't get greedy.

## David MULLIN - 3rd (Stableford: 162 pts, +22) | 1st (Gross: 51 strokes, **9th consecutive Green Jacket**)

David Mullin led the Stableford competition for 37 holes across Rounds 2 and 3, posted 162 points (tied for 4th best ever), finished third, and won his ninth consecutive Green Jacket from that third-place finish. This is no longer a paradox. This is David's operating system.

**The Lead That Vanished:** Led for 37 holes. THIRTY-SEVEN. After Round 2, David led by six points. After Round 3, by one point. After Round 4, by... negative 22. Alex posted 51 points in the finale while David managed 30, and suddenly that commanding lead was ancient history.

**The gross Domination:** Wire-to-wire. All four rounds won. Sixty-eight holes led out of 68 possible. Finished 12 strokes clear of Jon. The ninth consecutive jacket was never in doubt. Six birdies across four rounds. Peak David efficiency.

## Jon BAKER - 4th (Stableford: 157 pts, +27) | 2nd (Gross: 63 strokes, +12)

Jon Baker finished fourth with 157 points and second in gross, which are both perfectly respectable results that nobody will remember because Alex posted 184 and David won his ninth jacket from third place.

**The Rounds:** 37-40-43-37. Started solid, improved through the middle rounds, faded in the finale. Jon peaked in Round 3 with 43 points, which would've been impressive if Alex hadn't been posting 49.

**The Birdie Drought:** One birdie. Total. Jon went 72 holes finding exactly one hole he could play better than par. This is golf's version of rationing during wartime.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 5th (Stableford: 144 pts, +40) | 5th (Gross: 125 strokes, +74)

Stuart Neumann posted 144 Stableford points and fifth place, which is his most consistent finish: not wooden spoon, not trophy contention, just comfortably mid-table mediocrity.

**The Rounds:** 32-32-41-39. Stuartspent the first two rounds posting identical 32-point scores, apparently operating on autopilot, before waking up in Round 3 with 41 points. Too little, too late to challenge, but enough to secure fifth.

**The Zero-Birdie Club:** Joined Patterson in the "72 holes without a birdie" club. Stuarttreated birdies like cryptocurrencyâ€”theoretically possible, never actually acquired.

---

## John PATTERSON - 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 112 pts, +72) | 6th (Gross: 132 strokes, +81)

John Patterson won TEG 9 on debut with 168 points. One year later, he collected the wooden spoon with 112 points and zero birdies in 72 holes. This is golf's version of winning Best Picture then getting cancelled.

**The Birdie Drought:** ZERO. Not one birdie across four rounds. Patterson spent 72 holes failing to play a single hole better than par. Eagles require two better than par, which means Patterson would've needed to stack two TEG 10s back-to-back just to threaten an eagle.

**The Rounds:** 29-25-29-29. Metronomically terrible. Three rounds of 29 points sandwiched around one 25-point disaster. Patterson treated consistency like a virtue, forgetting that consistency at a terrible level is still terrible.
