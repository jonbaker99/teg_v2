# TEG 9 - Brief Summary

John Patterson made his TEG debut at Royal Óbidos and immediately claimed the trophy with 168 Stableford points, leading wire-to-wire across four rounds of efficient, drama-free golf. His 39-44-43-42 scoring progression established early control, extended dominance, and cruised to a 6-point victory over Alex Baker (162 points), who finished runner-up for the second consecutive year.

Dave Mullin's third-place Stableford finish (148 points) netted his eighth consecutive Green Jacket—the paradox now routine, the streak approaching legendary status. Jon Baker's fourth (146) and Gregg Williams' fifth (143) rounded out the mid-pack, while Stuart Neumann collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 127 points—an improvement from last year's historically bad 100, but still comprehensively last.

Patterson's debut trophy was earned through boring excellence. Alex's silver medal confirmed his status as TEG's professional runner-up. Dave's eighth Green Jacket from third place continued a streak that had achieved self-awareness. Royal Óbidos witnessed efficient dominance defeating consistent competence.
