Jon Baker claimed his second Trophy with a dramatic final-round surge across Portugal's Algarve coast, overturning a one-point deficit to win by three. The tournament delivered 18 lead changes across 72 holes before Baker seized control at the 13th hole of Round 4, his back-to-back birdies ending Gregg Williams' hopes.

David Mullin achieved something unprecedented in TEG history: winning the Green Jacket by 12 strokes whilst simultaneously collecting the Wooden Spoon. His wire-to-wire dominance in gross scoring contrasted starkly with a Stableford implosion, finishing 20 points behind Baker's 156.

Stuart Neumann's brilliance went unrewarded. His 45-point Round 2 performance tied the all-time Stableford record, whilst his plus-11 gross matched Mullin's Round 2 mark. Yet both records arrived in a losing cause, Neumann finishing joint-third, 17 points adrift of Baker.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Boavista {#round-1}

The tournament began with three players sharing the lead after the opening hole. Mullin's birdie at the third gave him outright control, a position strengthened by another birdie at the fifth.

Baker's quintuple bogey at the sixth threatened to derail his challenge early. An eight at the closing hole compounded his misery. Yet a birdie at the 16th had briefly restored his advantage, and he held a one-point lead over Mullin at day's end.

Williams suffered his own torment. Triple bogeys bookended the round, his seven at the opening hole setting an unfortunate tone, his quintuple at the 17th providing an equally grim finish. He closed five points behind Baker despite the chaos.

**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +12 | JB +20 | HuM +23 | SN +26 | GW +35

## Round 2: Neumann's Record-Breaking Brilliance {#round-2}

Stuart Neumann's 45 points equalled the all-time TEG Stableford record. Three birdies in the opening ten holes, including a rare five-pointer at the eighth, carried him to 25 points at the turn. His plus-11 gross score shared Round 2's record with Mullin.

Baker's blow-up at the second cost him the Trophy lead. Mullin reclaimed top spot at the eighth with a birdie, surrendered it briefly at the 13th following a triple bogey, then wrestled it back when multiple players collapsed at the 14th.

Henry Meller endured the round's grimmest stretch. Triple bogeys at the 14th and 18th sandwiched a quintuple at the 16th, bleeding 23 points in five holes. He registered just 11 points on the back nine after scoring 19 on the front.

Williams' 42 points moved him to within one of Mullin's lead. Baker slipped three back after managing just 36 points.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 79 | GW 78 | JB 76 | SN 75 | HM 64  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +23 | SN +37 | JB +42 | GW +62 | HM +73

## Round 3: Final-Hole Chaos Reshuffles Trophy Race {#round-3}

Mullin's opening birdie extended his Trophy advantage, but Williams snatched the lead at the third with a four-pointer. The lead changed hands three more times before the finishing holes delivered mayhem.

Baker's birdie at the 16th gave him control. Then came carnage. Triple bogeys at the 17th for Mullin, Williams and Neumann. Two quintuple bogeys and a triple at the 18th. Baker's nine at the last handed Williams the lead by a single point heading into the final round.

Baker's 38 points represented the round's best Stableford score, yet he surrendered the lead on the final hole. Mullin's 27 points marked his worst Stableford round in 14 attempts, though his plus-27 gross maintained his commanding Jacket advantage.

The Trophy standings compressed dramatically. Just six points separated first from fourth.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 115 | JB 114 | HM 109 | SN 107 | DM 106  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +50 | SN +64 | JB +66 | HM +70 | GW +94

## Round 4: Baker's Decisive Takeover at Palmares {#round-4}

The final round at the new Palmares Lagos/Praia course saw five lead changes before Baker seized permanent control at the 13th. His birdie there, following Williams' blow-up at the sixth and another at the eighth, gave Baker breathing room he wouldn't relinquish.

Williams held a slender lead through the front nine despite shipping points at the sixth. Baker's birdie at the third and par at the opening hole had briefly given him the advantage. His quintuple at the fifth handed it back.

Baker's closing stretch proved decisive. Birdies at the 13th, 14th and 15th built an unassailable cushion. Williams' quintuple bogey at the 16th sealed his fate, finishing three points behind despite leading after Round 3.

Mullin's late surge came too late to matter in Stableford terms. Consecutive birdies at the 12th and 13th, earning four points at the latter, lifted him off the bottom spot he'd occupied since the sixth. His plus-22 gross secured the Jacket by 12 strokes.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 156 | GW 153 | HM 148 | SN 139 | DM 136  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +72 | JB +84 | SN +88 | HM +90 | GW +126

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Jon Baker's second Trophy arrived courtesy of the most volatile tournament in recent memory. Eighteen lead changes across four rounds culminated in Baker overtaking Williams in a final-round shootout decided by three points. Baker led just 20 of 72 holes yet gained the Trophy lead five times, including his decisive takeover at Palmares' 13th.

Williams' heartbreak was complete. Leading by one point entering the final round, he watched Baker produce three birdies in four holes from the 13th whilst his own quintuple at the 16th extinguished his challenge. Zero birdies across 72 holes told its own story.

David Mullin's simultaneous triumph and disaster represents a TEG first. His wire-to-wire Jacket victory by 12 strokes demonstrated remarkable consistency, leading 71 of 72 holes in gross scoring. Yet his Wooden Spoon finish, 20 points behind Baker's 156, exposed the format's capacity for paradox. His 27-point Round 3 implosion, featuring blow-ups at the 10th, 13th and 17th, proved catastrophic.

Stuart Neumann's brilliance went unrewarded. His 45-point Round 2 tied the all-time Stableford record, whilst his plus-11 gross matched Mullin's mark. Three birdies in the opening ten holes, including a rare five-pointer at the eighth's Par 5, carried him to tournament history. Yet 11 zero-point holes across four rounds left him joint-third with Meller, 17 points behind Baker.

The final round delivered five lead changes before Baker's birdies at the 13th and 14th broke Williams' resistance. Baker's 42 points represented composure under pressure. Williams' 38 points couldn't prevent his runner-up finish after leading 30 of 72 holes.

## Player-by-Player Summary {#player-summary}

**Jon Baker (1st Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Overcame early disasters—quintuples at the sixth in Round 1 and 18th in Round 3, plus another at the fifth in Round 4—to claim his second Trophy. Five birdies across the tournament, including back-to-back at the 13th and 14th in the final round, proved decisive. Led just 20 of 72 holes but gained the lead five times, demonstrating remarkable resilience. Seven zero-point holes couldn't prevent victory by three points.

**Gregg Williams (2nd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Led after Round 3 by one point but couldn't convert. Zero birdies across 72 holes undermined his challenge despite leading 30 holes overall. Blow-ups at the sixth and eighth in Round 4 handed Baker control, whilst a quintuple at the 16th sealed his fate. Four triple bogeys or worse in Round 1 set an unfortunate tone. Finished three points behind Baker, his consistency not quite enough.

**Henry Meller (Joint-3rd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** A single birdie across four rounds limited his Trophy challenge, though his plus-17 final round represented his best gross performance. Zero-point disasters at the 14th, 16th and 18th in Round 2 cost him dearly—a quintuple at the 16th sandwiched between triple bogeys bleeding 23 points. Seven zero-point holes overall left him joint-third, nine points behind Baker.

**Stuart Neumann (Joint-3rd Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Record-breaking brilliance went unrewarded. His 45-point Round 2 tied the all-time Stableford record, whilst his plus-11 gross matched the Round 2 mark. Three birdies in the opening ten holes of Round 2, including a five-pointer at the eighth, carried him to tournament history. Yet 11 zero-point holes—including consecutive blow-ups at the 17th and 18th in Round 3—left him joint-third, 17 points adrift of Baker.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy / Wooden Spoon, 1st Jacket):** TEG history's first simultaneous Jacket winner and Wooden Spoon recipient. Led the Jacket competition 71 of 72 holes, winning by 12 strokes with six birdies across four rounds. Yet his 27-point Round 3 implosion—featuring blow-ups at the 10th, 13th and 17th—proved catastrophic in Stableford terms. Finished 20 points behind Baker's 156 despite his gross dominance.
