# TEG 5 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 5*

## Jon BAKER - "The Wire-to-Wire Specialist"

**Final Position:** 1st (Net vs Par: 156 pts) | 2nd (Gross: 98 strokes, +6)

### The Review

Jon Baker arrived at TEG 5 and did what Jon does best: led from start to finish with all the drama of someone completing a spreadsheet. His second TEG Trophy, his second wire-to-wire victory, his second demonstration that boring beats everything.

**The Dominance:** Led every round. Forty-five, 38, 38, 35. That's not excitement; that's a flat line with a gradual decline. Won by 11 points over Gregg. Never threatened. Never faltered. Never interesting.

**The Net vs Par Format:** This was the last tournament using net vs par scoring before the switch to Stableford. Jon mastered it one final time, then presumably forgot it existed.

**The Gross Reality:** Finished second to Dave by 6 strokes. In a normal world, that would mean something. At TEG, it means Dave won the Green Jacket while Jon won the actual trophy. Different games, different champions.

**Signature Moment:** Leading wire-to-wire. Again. When your signature move is "consistent competence for four days," you're Jon Baker and you're collecting trophies.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's second TEG Trophy was earned through the same formula as his first: be boring, be consistent, never collapse. It worked. It was effective. It was about as thrilling as watching paint dry. Elite status: confirmed. Entertainment value: absent.

**Rating:** 10/10 for winning. 1/10 for excitement. 10/10 for proving the boring-wins formula works every time.

## David MULLIN - "The Beautiful Paradox"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Net vs Par: 136 pts, +20) | 1st (Gross: 92 strokes, **Green Jacket**, +6 clear)

### The Review

David Mullin achieved something truly special at TEG 5: he simultaneously won the Green Jacket AND collected the wooden spoon. Same golf. Same weekend. Champion AND disaster. Golf's most absurd outcome.

**The Green Jacket:** Fourth consecutive. Ninety-two gross strokes, 6 clear of second. Dominant. Professional. Classic Dave grinding excellence.

**The Wooden Spoon:** Last place in net vs par with 136 points. LAST. The same rounds that delivered gross dominance left him trailing badly in net scoring. The net format looked at Dave's high handicap and said "not today, champion."

**The Rounds:** 29-30-27-26 in net points. That's not a progression; that's a descent into wooden spoon territory. Each round slightly worse than the last. Meanwhile, his gross golf was winning him the Green Jacket. The cognitive dissonance must have been spectacular.

**The Math:** Lead the gross by 6 strokes. Trail the net by 20 points. Same golf. Different results. Golf's dual scoring systems producing their masterpiece of absurdity.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting the Green Jacket with one hand while accepting the wooden spoon with the other. When your signature achievement is "simultaneous triumph and disaster," you're Dave Mullin at TEG 5.

**Overall Assessment:** Dave proved that you can be both champion and catastrophe in the same breath. Fourth consecutive Green Jacket, first wooden spoon, maximum confusion. The universe has a wicked sense of humor and Dave was the punchline.

**Rating:** 10/10 for Green Jacket. 0/10 for net scoring. 12/10 for achieving golf's greatest paradox.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Career Best Runner-Up"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Net vs Par: 145 pts, +11) | 5th (Gross: 127 strokes, +35)

### The Review

Gregg Williams achieved his career-best TEG finish with second place and 145 points, proving that sometimes not being terrible counts as success.

**The Performance:** 41-36-35-37. Decent. Solid. The kind of golf that earns respect without inspiring anyone. Gregg improved from his usual disasters to merely mediocre, and somehow that was enough for silver.

**The Margin:** Lost to Jon by 11 points. Never really threatened. Spent the week playing for second while Jon occupied first. Mission accomplished, I suppose.

**The Gross Reality:** Fifth place with 127 strokes. Thirty-five behind Dave. While Dave was paradoxically winning and losing, Gregg was just... there. Present. Accountable. Forgettable.

**Signature Moment:** Finishing second. For Gregg, this IS the signature moment. Career high! Trophy cabinet upgrade! Still not winning, but closer to winning than usual!

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's career-best second place was earned through the simple strategy of being slightly better than usual while everyone else (except Jon) was slightly worse than usual. No birdies, no disasters, one silver medal. The Gregg Williams peak performance.

**Rating:** 7/10 for career best. 5/10 for threatening Jon (didn't). 8/10 for improvement trajectory.

## Henry MELLER - "The Also-Ran"

**Final Position:** 3rd= (Net vs Par: 139 pts, +17) | 4th (Gross: 98 strokes, +6)

### The Review

Henry Meller finished third with 139 points through the simple strategy of being present and occasionally competent.

**The Rounds:** 35-32-36-34. That's not consistency; that's a random number generator stuck in the mid-30s. Henry played golf like someone who'd set an alarm for "mediocre" and hit snooze.

**The Birdies:** Four across the tournament. More than anyone else. Did it matter? Did it change anything? No and no. Henry collected birdies like participation trophiesâ€”nice to have, ultimately meaningless.

**The Irony:** Third in both net and gross. Perfect alignment of mediocrity. Henry was the same amount of "meh" in both scoring systems. That's consistency, I suppose.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting four birdies that didn't change his final position. When your signature achievement is "entertaining but futile," you're Henry Meller.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry's tied-third finish (with Stu) was earned through attacking golf that looked exciting but achieved nothing. Four birdies, bronze medal, zero threat to anyone above him. Golf rewards boring; Henry never learns.

**Rating:** 6/10 for entertainment. 5/10 for results. 10/10 for proving birdies don't win tournaments.

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Other Third Place"

**Final Position:** 3rd= (Net vs Par: 139 pts, +17) | 3rd (Gross: 99 strokes, +7)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann tied for third with 139 points by doing what Stu does best: existing without causing a fuss.

**The Rounds:** 30-34-33-38. That's not a trajectory; that's golf by random selection. Stu's final round 38 was his best, which is like bringing your A-game after the party's over. Timing, Stu. Timing.

**The Tie:** One hundred thirty-nine points, same as Henry. Except Henry had four birdies and Stu had one. Henry attacked; Stu survived. They tied. Golf makes no sense.

**The Gross Position:** Third with 99 strokes, one worse than Henry's 98. At least the scoring systems agreed that Stu was roughly as mediocre as Henry. Small mercies.

**Signature Moment:** Posting his best round (38) in R4 when it literally couldn't matter less. When your signature achievement is "too little too late," you're Stu Neumann.

**Overall Assessment:** Stu's tied-third finish was earned through professional mediocrity with one final-round flourish that changed nothing. One birdie, bronze medal (shared), zero excitement. The Stu Neumann guarantee: present, competent, forgettable.

**Rating:** 5/10 for performance. 3/10 for timing. 7/10 for being exactly who we expected.
