# TEG 2 Story Notes - Quick Reference

## Main Talking Points

### 🎯 Primary Storyline
- **Dave's First Double:** First TEG Trophy + Green Jacket (103 pts, 66 strokes)
- **The 18th Hole Massacre:** Round 2 - THREE players (Dave, Gregg, Jon) all triple bogey or worse on same hole. All score zero Stableford points simultaneously. Statistical anomaly. Beautiful disaster.
- **Jon's Near Miss:** Led after R2 with brilliant 37 pts (24-pt front 9!), then imploded R3 with 28 pts and 6 triple bogeys

### 🏆 Competition Results
- **TEG Trophy:** Dave (103) by 5 over Jon (98)
- **Green Jacket:** Dave (66) by 11 over Stu (77)
- **Wooden Spoon:** Henry (75) - BUT finished 3rd in gross! The paradox.

### 📊 Round-by-Round
1. **R1:** Dave 36 (leads), Jon 33, Henry's 5 consecutive triple bogeys (h11-15)
2. **R2:** Jon's 37-pt surge takes lead, THE 18TH HOLE DISASTER, Dave 29 stays close
3. **R3:** Dave's perfect 38 (19 front, 19 back, zero triples) seals it, Jon's 6-triple meltdown

### 💎 Key Moments
- **18th hole R2:** Three simultaneous disasters - "beautiful multi-car pileup"
- **Henry's horror:** 5 consecutive triple bogeys R1
- **Jon's front 9 R2:** 24 Stableford points - spectacular
- **Dave's R3:** Perfect balance, zero disasters, championship response
