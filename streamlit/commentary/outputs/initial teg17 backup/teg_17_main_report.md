# TEG 17 Tournament Report

## Baker's Processional: A Masterclass in Sustained Dominance

They say golf is a game of momentum swings, dramatic comebacks, and nail-biting finishes. Someone forgot to tell Jon Baker, who spent TEG 17 delivering a masterclass in making tournament golf look like a particularly pleasant Sunday stroll through the Portuguese countryside.

Baker's wire-to-wire demolitionâ€”if one can demolish something while barely breaking a sweatâ€”saw him lead for an absurd 67 of the tournament's 72 holes in the Stableford competition and an even more preposterous 70 holes in the Gross race. The margins tell the story: 18 Stableford points clear of David Mullin, 13 strokes ahead in Gross. This wasn't a tournament. It was a coronation with a four-day dress rehearsal.

### The Illusion of Competition

For approximately 18 holes, TEG 17 threatened to be interesting. John Patterson, clearly unaware of the script, seized the opening-round Stableford lead with a tidy 39 points at Praia D'El Rey. Meanwhile, Gregg Williams grabbed the early Gross advantage, posting 20 strokes while the rest of the field negotiated their relationship with Portuguese rough.

Then Round 2 happened.

Patterson, perhaps spooked by the responsibility of leadership, produced a performance so catastrophically bad it deserves its own documentary. Twenty-two Stableford points. Nine holes of triple-bogey-or-worse carnage. A collapse so complete it made the final day of the 2016 Warriors look like a masterclass in composure. He tumbled from first to fifth faster than you can say "what on earth happened at West Cliffs?"

Into this vacuum strode Baker, who responded to Mullin's tournament-best 47-point round with a perfectly adequate 44 points of his own. The lead changed hands precisely onceâ€”from Patterson's corpse to Baker's waiting armsâ€”and never budged again.

### Mullin's Pyrrhic Brilliance

Spare a thought for David Mullin, whose Round 2 at West Cliffs will go down as one of the great futile performances in TEG history. Forty-seven Stableford points. Three birdies. The round of the tournament by a country mile. It earned him... second place by 18 points.

Mullin's problem wasn't that 47-point masterpiece. It was what came after: a 39-hole birdie drought that stretched from the 16th hole of Round 2 all the way to the final putt of the tournament. You can't mount a challenge when your putter's on strike and your irons have joined the picket line.

Still, he claimed runner-up in both competitions, briefly held the Gross lead after Round 1, and provided the tournament's only moment of "maybe this could get interesting?" It couldn't. It didn't. But for 47 glorious points, we believed.

### The Wooden Spoon Paradox

Golf, in its infinite wisdom, has gifted us Gregg Williams: the man who finished third in the Gross competition (a perfectly respectable 89 strokes) while simultaneously claiming last place in Stableford and the coveted Wooden Spoon.

This is the sporting equivalent of winning bronze in the 100 meters while also being named slowest person in the stadium. Williams managed to be simultaneously competent and catastrophic, a feat that required an eight-hole nightmare streak of triple-bogeys-or-worse spanning Rounds 3 and 4. When your bad is that bad, even your good doesn't matter.

### The 18th Hole: Where Dreams Go to Die

If there's a villain in this story, it's the 18th hole across all four courses. Alex Baker opened proceedings with a quintuple-bogey-or-worse on the first day's closerâ€”a score so high it required  mathematical gymnastics to record. The final hole became a graveyard: Patterson's closing quad bogey, Mullin's final-round triple, a litany of zeros on the Stableford card.

The 18th didn't discriminate. It destroyed all comers with the cold efficiency of a particularly vindictive golf course architect who'd just been denied planning permission.

### Baker's Anticlimactic Brilliance

Back to our champion, who won both competitions with the same relentless consistency that makes watching paint dry seem thrilling by comparison. His rounds: 38-44-44-40 Stableford points. No eagles. Five birdies. Thirty-four bogeys. Six double bogeys. These are not the numbers of golf's great entertainers.

But they are the numbers of a champion who understood the assignment: don't lose. Baker led after Round 2 and simply refused to relinquish control. While Patterson imploded, Williams collected his Wooden Spoon, and Mullin staged futile mini-rallies, Baker played the percentages, avoided disasters, and let everyone else self-destruct.

It was clinical. It was efficient. It was about as exciting as reading the terms and conditions of your mobile phone contract. And it was utterly, devastatingly effective.

### The Footnote Brigade

A word for Alex Baker, who provided the tournament's most consistent performance in entirely the wrong way: 32-37-34-32 Stableford points across four rounds. A 33-hole birdie drought. A 17-hole over-par streak. Never in contention, never out of contention, always just... there. The human embodiment of "participating."

### The Numbers Don't Lie (But They Don't Entertain Either)

Zero eagles. Not one. In 72 holes of golf across three Portuguese courses, nobody managed better than a birdie. This was golf as trench warfare: grinding, attritional, occasionally brutal, rarely beautiful.

Jon Baker's 70-hole Gross lead streak speaks to dominance. David Mullin's 47-point Round 2 speaks to brilliance. John Patterson's 22-point Round 2 speaks to therapy requirements. Gregg Williams' Gross-Stableford paradox speaks to the mysteries of golf scoring systems.

### The Verdict

TEG 17 was the golfing equivalent of a heavyweight title fight where the champion jabs his way to a comfortable points decision while his opponent occasionally throws himself onto the canvas for no apparent reason.

Jon Baker won both trophies, posted a personal best (his best TEG performance ever, ninth all-time), and made it look easier than assembling IKEA furniture with the instructions. The Green Jacket and TEG Trophy both belong to a man who led for 70 of 72 holes and never broke a sweat doing it.

Was it dramatic? Only if you find inevitability thrilling. Was it entertaining? Only if you appreciate the cold beauty of systematic dominance. Was it effective? Devastatingly so.

Sometimes golf gives us Butler Cabin theater. Sometimes it gives us crunching drives and eagles galore. And sometimesâ€”just sometimesâ€”it gives us Jon Baker at TEG 17: relentless, unstoppable, and about as exciting as watching grass grow.

But when the grass grows 18 Stableford points taller than everyone else's, you can't help but admire the gardening.
