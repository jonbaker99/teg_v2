## The Story in Brief

Jon Baker delivered a masterclass in sustained dominance at TEG 17, claiming both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket with crushing margins that made the outcome a foregone conclusion by mid-tournament.

Leading for 67 of 72 holes in Stableford and an absurd 70 of 72 in Gross, Baker's wire-to-wire procession left his rivals fighting for minor placings while he strolled serenely to his personal best performance—his best TEG ever, and ninth all-time in the competition's history.

The margins tell the story: 18 Stableford points and 13 strokes clear in Gross. This wasn't a tournament; it was a coronation.

### What Little Drama There Was

**John Patterson's Collapse:** Led after Round 1 with 39 points, then imploded spectacularly in Round 2 with a tournament-worst 22 points and nine holes of disaster golf. He recovered to 41 points in Round 3, but the damage was irreparable.

**David Mullin's Futile Brilliance:** Posted the tournament's best round—47 Stableford points in Round 2 at West Cliffs, including three birdies. It earned him runner-up by 18 points. Couldn't maintain momentum, enduring a 39-hole birdie drought from Round 2 hole 16 to the finish.

**The Wooden Spoon Paradox:** Gregg Williams finished third in the Gross competition (89 strokes) while simultaneously claiming last place in Stableford and the Wooden Spoon. A testament to golf's ability to reward and punish simultaneously.

### The Numbers
