# TEG 17 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 17*

---

## Jon BAKER - "The Inevitable"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 166 pts) | 1st (Gross: 67 strokes)

### The Review

Jon Baker approached TEG 17 with all the dramatic flair of someone filling out a spreadsheet. And much like a well-formatted Excel document, his performance was methodical, consistent, and about as exciting as watching cells auto-populate.

**The Numbers:** Led for 67 of 72 holes (Stableford) and 70 of 72 (Gross). That's not dominance; that's occupation. Baker didn't win TEG 17 so much as annex it, plant a flag, and issue building permits.

**Round Progression:** 38-44-44-40 Stableford points. The kind of consistency that makes accountants weep with joy. Five birdies, 34 bogeys, six doubles. These are not the numbers of golf's great entertainers. These are the numbers of someone who read the assignment, understood the assignment, and executed the assignment with the passion of a tax return.

**Career Achievement Unlocked:** Personal best (his best TEG ever, ninth all-time). Proof that sometimes boring wins. Sometimes boring dominates. And sometimes boring makes everyone else look like they're playing a different sport.

**Signature Moment:** Taking the lead in Round 2 and then... just staying there. Revolutionary stuff.

**Overall Assessment:** Baker played golf like a robot programmed to minimize errors rather than maximize entertainment. It was clinical. It was efficient. It was devastatingly effective. And if you found it thrilling, you probably also enjoy watching paint dry in slow motion.

**Rating:** 10/10 for winning. 2/10 for keeping us awake.

## David MULLIN - "The Nearly Man"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 148 pts, +18) | 2nd (Gross: 80 strokes, +13)

### The Review

David Mullin spent TEG 17 proving that you can produce a moment of absolute brilliance and still finish as the bridesmaid. Again.

**The Glorious Moment:** Round 2 at West Cliffsâ€”47 Stableford points. Forty. Seven. Three birdies. The round of the tournament by approximately one country mile. For 18 holes, Mullin played golf that suggested he might actually trouble Baker's procession.

**The Reality Check:** Those 47 points earned him second place. By 18 points. That's the golfing equivalent of scoring a hat-trick and still losing 5-1.

**The Drought:** From hole 16 of Round 2 to the final putt of the tournament, Mullin went 39 holes without a birdie. Thirty-nine holes. That's not a drought; that's a desert. That's golf's version of writer's block, except instead of staring at a blank page, you're staring at a succession of bogeys wondering where your talent went.

**Brief Moment of Hope:** Took the gross lead after Round 1. Held it for exactly one round before Baker remembered he was playing a golf tournament and politely reclaimed it.

**Signature Moment:** Round 2's 47-point masterpiece, which will be remembered primarily as "that time Mullin was brilliant and it still didn't matter."

**Overall Assessment:** Mullin is the tournament's tragic figureâ€”capable of brilliance, prone to mediocrity, destined for second place. He brought fireworks to a tournament that Baker won with a calculator.

**Rating:** 9/10 for Round 2. 4/10 for everything else.

## John PATTERSON - "The Collapse Artist"

**Final Position:** 3rd= (Stableford: 135 pts, +31) | 4th (Gross: 124 strokes, +57)

### The Review

John Patterson's TEG 17 can be neatly divided into two categories: "That was surprisingly good" and "Oh dear God, what happened?"

**The Promise:** Round 1 was gloriousâ€”39 Stableford points, leading the tournament, playing golf that suggested he might actually have a say in proceedings. For one round, Patterson was a contender.

**The Catastrophe:** Round 2 was... less glorious. Twenty-two Stableford points. Nine holes of triple-bogey-or-worse carnage. A 44 gross score that suggested he'd perhaps mistaken West Cliffs for a minigolf course and was dismayed to discover real bunkers.

**The Mathematics of Disaster:** Patterson plummeted from first to fifth in one round. That's not a collapse; that's an implosion. That's golf's version of a stock market crash, except instead of losing money, you lose your dignity and the lead simultaneously.

**The Recovery:** Credit where it's dueâ€”Round 3 saw Patterson bounce back with 41 points. Admirable. Noble. Completely insufficient to undo Round 2's damage. It's like apologizing for burning down a house by offering to paint the mailbox.

**Final Round Indignity:** Capped his week with a quadruple bogey on the 18th hole, because apparently the golf gods decided Patterson hadn't suffered enough.

**Signature Moment:** Leading after Round 1, then discovering that leads are fragile things when you play like someone's just told you golf has been cancelled mid-tournament.

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson provided the tournament's only genuine dramaâ€”mostly by imploding spectacularly. He arrived as a contender, departed as a cautionary tale about the importance of Round 2.

**Rating:** 8/10 for R1. 1/10 for R2. 7/10 for chaos.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Paradox"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 123 pts, +43, **Wooden Spoon**) | 3rd (Gross: 89 strokes, +22)

### The Review

Gregg Williams accomplished something truly special at TEG 17: finishing third in one competition while simultaneously claiming last place in the other. This is golf's version of quantum physicsâ€”existing in two states simultaneously, both of them confusing.

**The gross Story:** Williams posted 89 strokes, good enough for bronze. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that suggests competence.

**The Stableford Story:** Williams posted 123 points, comfortably last, earning him the Wooden Spoon. The kind of performance that suggests someone forgot how Stableford scoring works.

**The Great Mystery:** How does one finish third in gross but last in Stableford? The answer involves a fundamental misunderstanding of where to place one's disasters. Williams chose poorly.

**The Evidence:** Led gross after Round 1 with 20 strokes. Then proceeded to demonstrate that early leads in one competition don't prevent last place finishes in another. It's a skill, really.

**Birdie Count:** Two. For the entire tournament. Williams treated birdies like rare collectiblesâ€”something to be admired occasionally but never actually acquired in meaningful quantities.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting the Wooden Spoon while simultaneously accepting congratulations for third in gross. The cognitive dissonance must have been spectacular.

**Overall Assessment:** Williams is TEG 17's greatest enigmaâ€”simultaneously successful and disastrous. He's SchrÃ¶dinger's golfer: both good and terrible until you check the scorecard.

**Rating:** 6/10 for gross. 2/10 for Stableford. 10/10 for confusion.

## Alex BAKER - "The Footnote"

**Final Position:** 3rd= (Stableford: 135 pts, +31) | 5th (Gross: 150 strokes, +83)

### The Review

Alex Baker's TEG 17 performance can be summarized in one word: present. He was there. He played golf. Things happened, none of them particularly noteworthy.

**The Numbers:** 32-37-34-32 Stableford across four rounds. That's not consistency; that's a straight line. Baker played with the excitement of someone reading terms and conditions. Thoroughly. Twice.

**Round 1, Hole 18:** Quintuple bogey or worse. Baker opened his tournament by discovering that the first hole 18 can, in fact, accept scores so high they require scientific notation. It set the tone for a week of "well, at least it's not Round 1, Hole 18."

**The Streaks:**
- 33 holes without a birdie (R3 H4 to R4 H18)
- 17 consecutive holes over par
- Various other streaks suggesting Baker was in a long-term relationship with bogeys

**Birdie Count:** Two. Baker treated birdies like solar eclipsesâ€”rare, briefly exciting, and mostly something other people experienced.

**Championship Implications:** None. Baker was never in contention, never threatening, never particularly interesting. He was golf's equivalent of elevator musicâ€”pleasant enough, utterly forgettable.

**Signature Moment:** That Round 1, Hole 18 disaster. When your signature moment is a quintuple bogey, you know it's been that kind of week.

**Overall Assessment:** Baker showed up, played mediocre golf with admirable consistency, and finished exactly where you'd expect someone with his week to finish: somewhere in the middle, tied with Patterson, but without any of Patterson's dramatic flair.

**Rating:** 3/10 for entertainment. 3/10 for performance. 10/10 for reliability (he reliably shot around 33 Stableford points).
