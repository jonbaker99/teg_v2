## Tournament Summary {#recap}

Henry Meller claimed his first Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance across Portugal's Lisbon Coast, holding the lead for 69 of 72 holes. The margin tells only part of the story: five points over a second-place tie between Gregg Williams and David Mullin, who somehow finished level on 170 points despite being separated by 51 strokes in gross scoring.

Mullin's sixth Green Jacket arrived via ruthless consistency rather than Stableford flair. His 15-stroke margin represented total gross dominance, capped by a Praia D'El Rey course record 83 in the final round. Yet net scoring told a different tale: five points behind Meller, tied for second in the primary competition.

Jon Baker's challenge imploded spectacularly in Round 3. Two consecutive disasters at holes 2 and 3 registered +5 and +4 respectively, bleeding crucial points. His brother Alex, making his debut, collected the Wooden Spoon with eight blow-ups including three catastrophic scores of 9 or worse.

## Round 1: Opening Shots at Praia D'El Rey {#round-1}

Praia D'El Rey's links-parkland hybrid provided an eventful opener. Meller and Jon Baker traded leads through the front nine before Baker's quadruple bogey at the 2nd surrendered early control. Meller seized command at the 14th with a solid par, never to relinquish it.

Baker's birdie at the opening hole had given him the Jacket lead, but his quadruple at the par-3 2nd cost him both competitions simultaneously. Mullin's birdie at the 5th briefly put him ahead in gross scoring. Alex Baker's quintuple at the same hole set the tone for a difficult week. Meller's own blow-up at the 8th, a quadruple on the par-5, temporarily cost him the Trophy lead, but his recovery down the stretch proved decisive.

The round's defining stretch came at holes 9-14, where Meller accumulated 18 points playing level par. His par at the 14th reclaimed both leads. Mullin's quadruple at the 18th dropped him from the Jacket lead, handing that honour to Jon Baker by a single stroke.

**Trophy Standings:** HM 49 | JB 47 | GW 43 | DM 40 | SN 39 | AB 36  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +11 | HM +12 | DM +16 | SN +20 | GW +25 | AB +37

## Round 2: Meller's Breakaway at Bom Sucesso {#round-2}

Meller's 51 points at Bom Sucesso broke the field wide open. Jon Baker briefly retook the Trophy lead at the 2nd, losing it again a hole later. From that point, Meller's dominance became comprehensive, extending his margin to 10 points by day's end.

The par-5 7th provided the round's most dramatic action. Meller and Mullin both birdied, whilst Williams registered a triple bogey as part of a wretched stretch. His back-to-back disasters at holes 14 and 15 (both +3 or worse, including a quintuple at the 15th) destroyed any lingering Trophy ambitions. Jon Baker's triple at the 15th cost him the Jacket lead for good.

Mullin's 81 represented the tournament's finest gross round, seizing the Jacket lead by three strokes. Stuart Neumann surged from fifth to third in the Trophy with 49 points, his birdies at the 1st and 10th anchoring a consistent performance. Alex Baker produced his best round (42 points) despite a quadruple at the opener.

**Trophy Standings:** HM 100 | JB 90 | SN 88 | DM 86 | GW 81 | AB 78  
**Green Jacket Standings:** HM +22 | DM +25 | JB +25 | SN +30 | GW +56 | AB +67

## Round 3: Grinding Through Royal Óbidos {#round-3}

Royal Óbidos produced golf's unique blend of brilliance and brutality. Meller extended his Trophy cushion to 12 points despite consecutive disasters at holes 15 and 17. Mullin's octuple bogey at the 15th temporarily cost him the Jacket lead, though he recovered to finish ahead.

Jon Baker's challenge died at holes 2 and 3. A quintuple and a quadruple in consecutive holes represented 10 and 7 strokes respectively, wiping out nine Stableford points. He would never threaten the lead again. Williams' birdie at the 8th anchored a stretch where he played level par through holes 7-10, but a quintuple at the 14th killed any momentum.

Neumann's quintuple at the 12th, sandwiched between blow-ups at the 11th and 13th (where he birdied), exemplified the day's volatility. Mullin's birdie at the 3rd helped him match par through holes 3-5, but Royal Óbidos exacted its toll later. Meller's six-hole stretch from 9-14 yielded 19 points, maintaining his comfortable cushion.

**Trophy Standings:** HM 137 | DM 125 | JB 123 | SN 121 | GW 122 | AB 114  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +43 | HM +46 | JB +51 | SN +57 | GW +84 | AB +103

## Round 4: The Coronation at Praia D'El Rey {#round-4}

Meller's final-round 38 points secured the Trophy by five points. Williams and Neumann both posted 48 points to leap into contention for second, but Meller's three-round buffer proved insurmountable. Jon Baker's implosion at holes 10-11 sealed his drop from third to fifth.

The 10th hole claimed multiple victims. Jon Baker's sextuple, scoring 11 strokes, represented the tournament's single worst hole. Mullin and Alex Baker both registered triples. The following hole provided no respite for Baker, who added a quadruple to complete consecutive zeros. Mullin's birdie there steadied his Jacket charge.

Mullin's 83 strokes set the Praia D'El Rey course record, his birdie at the par-5 17th capping a supreme gross performance. He averaged less than one over par per round, the tournament's only player under par on average. Neumann's birdies at holes 2 and 7 led his 48-point surge, matching Williams' total despite finishing 11 strokes apart in gross scoring.

Alex Baker's week ended with a quintuple at the 16th, his third catastrophic score. His birdie at the 14th provided brief respite, but the Wooden Spoon had long been decided.

**Trophy Standings:** HM 175 | DM 170 | GW 170 | SN 169 | JB 164 | AB 152  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +53 | HM +69 | SN +68 | JB +71 | GW +104 | AB +139

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Meller's maiden Trophy arrived via the most comprehensive wire-to-wire performance in recent memory. Leading 69 of 72 holes, his five-point margin over the second-place tie understated the control he exerted. His sole deficit came in Round 1 when Jon Baker briefly led at holes 6-7. Williams' one-hole lead at hole 2 of Round 2 provided fleeting drama before Meller snatched it back and never looked threatened again.

The second-place deadlock between Williams and Mullin exposed Stableford scoring's extreme distortions. Identical on 170 points, they finished 51 strokes apart in gross play. Mullin's sixth Jacket came via ruthless consistency: averaging +0.74 per round, his course record 83 in Round 4 capped a masterclass in stroke play. Yet net scoring revealed only mediocrity, five points adrift of Meller's Trophy total.

Jon Baker's tournament arc traced a familiar pattern. His Round 1 lead dissolved at the 2nd hole's quadruple bogey. Round 3's catastrophic stretch at holes 2-3 dealt the fatal blow: consecutive scores of 10 and 7, bleeding nine Stableford points. Round 4's back-to-back zeros at holes 10-11, featuring an 11-stroke sextuple, completed his collapse from second to fifth.

Alex Baker's debut provided harsh lessons. Eight blow-ups including three catastrophic scores (9 or worse) secured the Wooden Spoon. His quintuples at holes 5 of Round 1 and 6 of Round 4, plus a quintuple at the 16th in the finale, represented golf at its most punishing. One birdie at the 14th of Round 4 offered scant consolation.

Meller's transformation from two-time Wooden Spoon winner to Trophy champion marked a remarkable reversal of fortunes. His consistency across four rounds (standard deviation 7.27, lowest in the field) contrasted sharply with previous volatility. The margin of victory, whilst modest at five points, reflected near-total control from the 14th hole of Round 1 onwards.

## Player-by-Player Summary {#player-summary}

**Henry Meller (1st Trophy):** Wire-to-wire maiden Trophy triumph, leading 69 of 72 holes from the 14th of Round 1 onwards. Extended cushion each round (2pts → 10pts → 12pts), surviving late disasters at Royal Óbidos (holes 15-17) to secure five-point victory. Most consistent performer (StdDev 7.27), reversing two prior Wooden Spoons with commanding control.

**David Mullin (2nd Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Sixth career Green Jacket via 15-stroke margin and Praia D'El Rey course record 83 (+10) in Round 4. Only player averaging under par per round (+0.74), yet net scoring revealed mediocrity: tied second in Trophy, five points behind Meller. Birdies at crucial moments (Round 2's 7th, Round 4's 11th and 17th) steadied Jacket charge despite disasters elsewhere (octuple at Round 3's 15th).

**Gregg Williams (2nd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Second-place Trophy tie (170 points) masked gross struggles: finished 51 strokes behind Mullin despite identical Stableford totals. Final-round 48 points (best of week) leap-frogged into contention, but three-round buffer proved insurmountable. Round 2's back-to-back disasters (holes 14-15, including quintuple) and Round 3's quintuple at the 14th killed earlier ambitions.

**Stuart Neumann (4th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Consistent top-four finisher across all rounds, final-round 48 points (tied best) nearly vaulted into second. Five birdies (tied most in field with Mullin) anchored steady performances, though Round 3's quintuple at the 12th cost crucial points. Surged from fifth to fourth in Trophy with closing 48-point flourish at Praia D'El Rey.

**Jon Baker (5th Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Collapsed from contention via catastrophic stretches: Round 3's consecutive scores of 10 and 7 at holes 2-3, bleeding nine points, then Round 4's sextuple-quadruple double blow at holes 10-11. Led briefly in Rounds 1-2 before disasters struck. Dropped from second (10 back after Round 2) to fifth (11 back), challenge evaporating at Royal Óbidos.

**Alex Baker (6th Trophy, 6th Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Debut week yielded first Wooden Spoon via eight blow-ups including three catastrophic scores (9+ strokes). Quintuples at Round 1's 5th, Round 4's 6th and 16th represented harshest lessons. One birdie (Round 4's 14th) provided brief respite in otherwise torrid introduction to TEG golf. Finished 23 points behind fifth place, 87 strokes off Jacket pace.
