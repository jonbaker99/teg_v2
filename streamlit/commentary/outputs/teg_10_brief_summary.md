Alex Baker secured his first TEG Trophy with a masterclass in momentum, his four progressively stronger rounds (41-45-47-51 points) culminating in a tournament-record 51-point finale that sealed an 11-point victory over Gregg Williams. Meanwhile, David Mullin claimed his ninth Green Jacket by 12 strokes despite a Stableford collapse that saw him tumble from first after Round 2 to fifth by Round 3. The split champions epitomized a tournament where consistency in one format meant little in the other.

Williams, in his first career runner-up finish, was tied with Baker entering the final round but couldn't match the champion's blistering 21-point burst from holes 5-10 on Sunday. Round 3 delivered the drama with five lead changes, most notably when Mullin's triple bogeys on holes 9, 11, and 13 shattered his Trophy defense while he maintained an iron grip on the Gross competition, leading for 68 of 72 holes.

John Patterson's wooden spoon by 32 points featured a nightmarish 20 zero-point holes across the tournament, including six disasters in the final round alone. The Algarve return after five years proved unforgivingâ€”only 12 birdies tournament-wide and Baker's record 51 points stood as the lone bright spot in an otherwise brutal week of scoring.
