Alex Baker captured his maiden TEG Trophy with an electrifying final-round surge, posting a tournament-record 51 points to win the Stableford by 11 points over Gregg Williams. After trailing by five at halfway and entering the final day tied for the lead, Baker broke away with a blistering stretch from holes 5-10 that yielded 21 points, including three successive 4-pointers. Meanwhile, David Mullin claimed his ninth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire gross dominance, leading for 68 of 72 holes and winning by 12 strokes—making this tournament one of split champions telling contrasting stories of consistency versus climactic brilliance.

Williams made history of his own by finishing runner-up in both competitions despite never previously winning a Green Jacket, while the real nightmare belonged to John Patterson. His collapse across 72 holes—featuring 20 zero-point holes and disasters averaging over three per round—resulted in the worst-ever margin from winner to wooden spoon at 72 points. Patterson's tournament featured multiple quintuple bogeys and ended with a catastrophic nonuple bogey on the final hole, the punctuation mark on the tournament's most painful performance.

Baker's victory was particularly sweet after consecutive runner-up finishes at TEG 8 and TEG 9, with his breakthrough coming five years after the Algarve last hosted. His 51-point final round stood as the best single round in tournament history, powered entirely by his middle-hole mastery while Mullin cruised home with the composure of someone who never trailed on gross score after the opening hole.
