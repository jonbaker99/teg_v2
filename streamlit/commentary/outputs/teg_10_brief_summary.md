# TEG 10: Baker Claims Maiden Trophy, Mullin Dominates Gross

The 2017 edition returned to Portugal's Algarve after a five-year absence, playing Boavista and the new 27-hole Palmares layout across four rounds.

Alex Baker captured his first Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory from Round 3, winning by 11 points with 184 total. His championship-sealing 51-point final round set an all-time TEG record. David Mullin claimed his ninth Green Jacket—extending his own tournament record—by 12 strokes at +51 gross, leading all 72 holes despite a mid-tournament Stableford collapse that saw him plummet from an 8-point lead to third place. Gregg Williams finished runner-up in both competitions but never threatened either leaderboard.

The drama belonged to John Patterson's historic implosion: 22 points lost from Round 2 to Round 4, recording 20 zero-point disasters across the week to earn the Wooden Spoon. His final-round 21 points at Boavista marked his worst competitive display. Baker's closing surge—averaging 49 points across his final two rounds—proved decisive after trailing by five at halfway.
