# TEG 2 - Player Profiles

---

## David MULLIN - 1st (Stableford: 103 pts) | 1st (Gross: 66 strokes)

David Mullin arrived at TEG 2 and proceeded to demonstrate that winning your first TEG Trophy doesn't require fireworks, flair, or even particularly good golf. It just requires everyone else to be slightly worse.

**The Opening Statement:** Round 1's 36 points featured 22 on the front nine and two actual birdies. For David, this was equivalent to a royal flush. He'd used up his year's allocation of exciting golf in nine holes and decided to coast the rest of the way on fumes and determination.

**The 18th Hole Incident:** Round 2, hole 18. Triple bogey or worse. Zero Stableford points. David participated in what can only be described as synchronized golfing incompetence with Gregg and Jonâ€”three grown men simultaneously discovering that the 18th hole has teeth. The probability of this occurring is roughly equivalent to being struck by lightning while winning the lottery. Except instead of money, you win humiliation.

## Jon BAKER - 2nd (Stableford: 98 pts, +5) | 4th (Gross: 97 strokes, +31)

Jon Baker's TEG 2 can be neatly summarized as a cooking disaster: spectacular rise in Round 2, catastrophic collapse in Round 3. The golfing equivalent of a soufflÃ© that looked Instagram-worthy for approximately 45 minutes before imploding into sadness.

**Round 1:** A solid 33 points. Professional. Threatening. Sitting 3 points behind David like a patient assassin.

**Round 2 - The Glory:** Thirty-seven Stableford points of absolute brilliance. The front nine posted 24 pointsâ€”TWENTY-FOURâ€”and briefly suggested Jon might actually trouble David's coronation. One birdie, one magnificent front nine, one moment of pure golfing joy. Jon led by 5 heading into the finale. The trophy was visible. The champagne was on ice.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 3rd (Stableford: 89 pts, +14) | 2nd (Gross: 77 strokes, +11)

Stuart Neumann played TEG 2 like a man who'd read the assignment, understood the assignment, and decided "bronze medal will do nicely, thanks."

**The Rounds:** 27, 29, 33. That's not a scoring progression; that's a gentle upward slope. Stuartimproved each round with all the drama of watching grass grow. Consistent? Yes. Exciting? Have you ever watched paint dry? Because that's roughly the same experience.

**Round 3 Birdie:** Stuartmanaged one birdie in Round 3, suggesting he was warming to the task. Unfortunately, by then the tournament was over and everyone had gone home. It's like arriving to a party with great wine after everyone's switched to coffee and regrets.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 4th (Stableford: 86 pts, +17) | 5th (Gross: 111 strokes, +45)

Gregg Williams spent TEG 2 proving that golf is hard, Boavista is harder, and some weeks you're just the universe's cosmic punchline.

**The Opening Disaster:** Round 1 posted 28 points and six triple bogeys, including participation in Gregg's least favorite game: "how many consecutive holes can I disaster?" The answer was frequently "more than you'd think."

**The 8-Hole Horror:** Somewhere between rounds 1 and 2, Gregg discovered an 8-hole streak of double bogeys or worse. Eight holes. Eight disasters. It's not a streak; it's a lifestyle choice. It's golf's version of a true crime documentary, except the only victim is Gregg's scorecard.

## Henry MELLER - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 75 pts, +28) | 3rd (Gross: 93 strokes, +27)

Henry Meller achieved something truly special at TEG 2: finishing last in Stableford while simultaneously claiming third in gross scoring. This is golf's version of quantum mechanicsâ€”existing in two states simultaneously, both of them confusing, one of them deeply embarrassing.

**Round 1 - The Horror:** Eighteen Stableford points. Sounds bad? It gets worse. Holes 11-15 featured FIVE CONSECUTIVE TRIPLE BOGEYS. Five holes. Five disasters. One after another, like dominos falling, except the dominos are your hopes and dreams and they're all on fire.

**The Mathematics of Suffering:** Five consecutive triples in Round 1 doesn't just cost you points; it costs you dignity, pride, and any illusions about your golfing ability. Henry watched those five holes unfold like a slow-motion car crash, except he was driving all five cars simultaneously.
