# TEG 17 Story Notes

## Key Points
- **Jon's 4th Trophy & 4th Green Jacket** - Wire-to-wire double (166 pts, 76 strokes)
- **Dominant victory** - Won by 18 in Stableford, 13 in Gross
- **Led 67/72 holes Stableford, 70/72 Gross**
- **Patterson's R2 collapse** - Led R1, posted 22 pts in R2 (9 triple-bogeys-or-worse)
- **Gregg's wooden spoon** - Despite finishing 3rd in Gross (paradox reversed!)
- **Dave's brilliant R2** - 47 pts (tournament best), still finished 2nd by 18

## How It Unfolded
**Round 1:** Patterson 39 (Stableford), Gregg 20 (Gross leads)
**Round 2:** Jon takes both leads, Patterson collapses (22 pts), Dave posts 47
**Round 3:** Jon extends dominance
**Round 4:** Jon cruises to 18-point / 13-stroke victories

## Story Angles
- Jon's wire-to-wire dominance (67/70 holes led)
- Patterson's catastrophic R2 (led â†’ 5th in one round)
- Dave's 47-point masterpiece in losing effort
- Gregg's paradox: 3rd Gross, last Stableford (WS)
- Most dominant victory margins in TEG history
- No eagles, no 5-pointers (first time since TEG 15 had last eagle)
