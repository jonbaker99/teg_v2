# TEG 6 Story Notes

## Key Points
- **Still Net vs Par Format** (Stableford starts TEG 8)
- **Gregg's First Trophy:** 145 pts (net vs par), led all 4 rounds wire-to-wire
- **The Decline:** Gregg's rounds: 48-36-33-28 (won while getting worse!)
- **Dave's 5th GJ:** Finished 4th in net (135) but won GJ
- **Jon's Near Miss:** 142 pts, just 3 behind Gregg
- **Henry's WS:** 123 pts, distant last
- **Course:** PGA Catalunya (new venue)

## How It Unfolded
R1: Gregg 48 (HUGE opener!), Jon 44, Stu 37, Dave 35, Henry 28
R2: Gregg 36 (leads by 4), Jon 40, Dave 37, Stu 36, Henry 31
R3: Gregg 33 (leads by 1!), Jon 32, Stu 35, Dave 32, Henry 34
R4: Gregg 28 (wins by 3), Jon 26, Stu 31, Dave 31, Henry 30

## Story Angles
- Gregg's backwards trajectory: started 48, finished 28, still won
- R1's 48 points = early knockout punch
- Jon's late fade (26 in R4)
- Dave: 4th in net, 1st in GJ (5th consecutive!)
- Gregg's nervousness showing? Each round worse than last
- Still net vs par (Stableford switch comes TEG 8)

## Quote-Worthy Lines
- "Winning while declining"
- "48-point opener, 28-point closer, one trophy"
- "Gregg peaked in Round 1 and coasted downhill to victory"
- "Dave finished 4th and collected his 5th Green Jacket - different games"

## Stats
- Gregg: Led 72/72 holes despite declining scores
- Jon: 142 pts, only 3 behind
- Dave: 5th consecutive GJ, 4th in net
- Margin: Gregg won by just 3 pts despite R1's dominance
- Format: Still net vs par (TEG 8 switches to Stableford)
