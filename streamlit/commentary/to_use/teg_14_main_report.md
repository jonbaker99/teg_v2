## Tournament Summary {.recap}

David Mullin claimed his third Trophy and tenth Green Jacket with a commanding wire-to-wire performance across the Kent coastline. Leading after every round in both competitions, Mullin's dominance was nearly complete: 60 of 72 holes in Stableford, 70 of 72 holes in gross. The final margins—two points in the Trophy, seven strokes in the Jacket—told only half the story of his control.

Alex Baker mounted the tournament's fiercest challenge, his spectacular 43-point finale slashing an eight-point deficit to two in the closing stretch. Too little, too late. The charge fell agonisingly short despite producing the tournament's finest Stableford round.

Jon Baker's week embodied golf's cruellest paradox. Second in the Jacket with a respectable plus-75, yet 29 points adrift in fourth for the Trophy, claiming his first Wooden Spoon. Five birdies couldn't compensate for 11 blow-ups. Gregg Williams held third throughout, steadily accumulating 137 points whilst keeping Mullin honest in the gross competition.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Royal Cinque Ports {.round-1}

Royal Cinque Ports provided the formidable opening test, its championship links baring teeth in classic Kent fashion. Multiple lead changes punctuated the early holes before Mullin seized control.

Mullin and Alex Baker shared the early lead with matching pars at the first. Baker held the Jacket briefly through six holes before a catastrophic implosion at the 16th—ten strokes on the par-four—obliterated his challenge. Mullin's birdie at the tenth, bookended by steady pars at the 15th, established breathing room. He closed with 40 points and plus-15, three clear in the Trophy, five ahead in the Jacket.

Baker recovered from his disaster to salvage 37 points, sharing second with Williams at plus-21. Jon Baker's nightmare stretch—blow-ups at the third and fifth—left him 10 points back with 29 despite managing plus-20. The younger Baker averaged close to 3-over per hole through his opening six. All four players demonstrated stronger finishing, their back nines outscoring front nines by five to nine points.

## Round 2: Mullin Extends at Littlestone {.round-2}

Littlestone's classic links, designed by the architect of Royal St George's, witnessed Mullin extending his advantage to nine points. His 41-point round featured birdies at the seventh and 18th, the par-fives surrendering briefly to his precision.

Alex Baker's challenge crumbled through the middle stretch. Blow-ups at the fifth and eighth—the latter a quadruple bogey—left him averaging 3-over per hole across six consecutive holes. He clawed back 21 points over the back nine but finished with 35, now nine behind. Jon Baker matched his opening 29, plagued by a triple at the seventh. Williams managed only 27 after three blow-ups including bookend disasters at the first and 18th.

Mullin's lead had doubled. Plus-29 cumulative gross gave him a 12-stroke Jacket cushion over Jon Baker's plus-50. The Trophy gap to Alex Baker—nine points—felt comfortable heading to Prince's.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 81 | AB 72 | GW 60 | JB 58  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +29 | JB +41 | GW +47 | AB +55

## Round 3: Prince's Provides Drama {.round-3}

Prince's Shore-Dunes combination delivered the round's most entertaining chaos. Williams produced the tournament's finest gross round—14-over—to claim top honours in the Jacket standings. His 39 points in Stableford featured no blow-ups over the back nine, steady pars from nine through 11 anchoring the surge.

Mullin endured his roughest stretch. Consecutive zeros at the seventh and eighth—the latter a quadruple on the par-five—threatened his dominance. He closed with a birdie at the 18th, salvaging 36 points and plus-20. The Trophy lead shrunk to eight over Alex Baker, who posted 37 despite blow-ups at the tenth and 16th.

Jon Baker's volatility continued. A birdie at the second preceded blow-ups at the fourth, sixth, 11th, 13th and 17th. Five disasters across 18 holes yielded just 28 points, dropping him 31 behind. Mullin's cumulative advantage remained substantial: eight points in the Trophy, 12 strokes in the Jacket. One round remained.

**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +49 | GW +61 | JB +64 | AB +80

## Round 4: Baker's Furious Finale Falls Short {.round-4}

Alex Baker unleashed 43 points of fury. The tournament's best Stableford round slashed Mullin's lead from eight to two, four consecutive points from the 13th through 15th providing late momentum. A catastrophic sextuple bogey at the 16th—his second ten of the week on different par-fours—briefly threatened the charge. Too late to derail it entirely.

Jon Baker won the round in gross with plus-11, featuring birdies at the second, sixth, 12th and 13th. The 11th through 13th stretch saw him average 1-under per hole, magnificent golf. Then the 16th arrived—double bogey—before a quadruple at the 18th destroyed his finish. Williams posted 38 points and plus-15, steady throughout.

Mullin's 37-point round secured both titles. A blow-up at the tenth—quadruple bogey—allowed Baker's charge oxygen, but Mullin's consistency across 72 holes proved insurmountable. Final margins: two points in the Trophy, seven strokes in the Jacket. Jon Baker's plus-75 secured second in gross. His 125 Stableford points, fourth place, earned the Wooden Spoon by 29 points.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 154 | AB 152 | GW 137 | JB 125  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +68 | JB +75 | GW +76 | AB +102

## Tournament Recap {.recap}

David Mullin's third Trophy and tenth Green Jacket arrived via the most commanding wire-to-wire performance the Kent coast has witnessed. Leading 60 of 72 holes in Stableford, 70 of 72 in gross, his two-point Trophy margin understated the control he exerted. Four birdies across 72 holes—including crucial strikes at the tenth in Round 1 and the 18th in Round 3—anchored his 154-point total.

Alex Baker's 43-point finale produced the tournament's most dramatic moment. Closing an eight-point gap to two, his charge demonstrated what might have been with earlier consistency. Nine blow-ups across the week, including catastrophic tens at par-fours in Rounds 1 and 4, cost him dearly. Zero birdies told its own story.

Jon Baker's paradox finish embodied golf's harsh arithmetic. Second in the Jacket at plus-75, his five birdies—three in the final round—showcased genuine quality. Yet 11 blow-ups across 72 holes left him 29 points behind in fourth, claiming his first Wooden Spoon. Strong gross play meant nothing without Stableford consistency.

Gregg Williams' steady third place—137 points, plus-76—featured no eagles, no birdies, seven blow-ups. Solid without spectacular. Mullin's tenth Jacket cements his legacy dominance in gross competition, now three clear of any rival. His sweep of both titles at TEG 14 confirms his status as the format's most complete player.

## Player-by-Player Summary {.player-summary}

**David Mullin (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Wire-to-wire dominance across both competitions, leading after every round. Four birdies and strong finishing ability—particularly evident in Round 1 with a ten-point advantage on the back nine—anchored his 154-point Trophy victory. His tenth Green Jacket, won by seven strokes at plus-68, cements his legacy as the tournament's most decorated gross competitor.

**Alex Baker (2nd):** Tournament-best 43-point finale nearly stole the Trophy, closing an eight-point gap to two in the final round. Nine blow-ups across the week, including catastrophic tens on different par-fours in Rounds 1 and 4, ultimately cost him the title. Finished with 152 points and plus-102, proving consistent enough to challenge but not quite clutch enough to triumph.

**Gregg Williams (3rd):** Steady accumulation of 137 points kept him in third throughout, never threatening the lead but never collapsing. His Round 3 performance—39 points and the tournament's finest gross round at 14-over—showcased his capability. Seven blow-ups across 72 holes told of solid rather than spectacular golf, finishing at plus-76.

**Jon Baker (4th, Wooden Spoon):** Golf's cruellest paradox personified—second in the Jacket at plus-75, yet 29 points adrift in the Trophy with 125 points. Five birdies, including three in the final round's 11th-through-13th surge, demonstrated genuine quality. Eleven blow-ups, particularly the quadruple at the final hole, cost him dearly in Stableford. First Wooden Spoon earned despite respectable gross performance.
