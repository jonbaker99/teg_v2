# TEG 4: East Sussex and Surrey (2011)

David Mullin claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket with wire-to-wire gross dominance and steady Stableford play across four new English courses. The two-time champion led 64 of 72 holes in the Gross competition, converting his consistency into a 3-point Trophy victory and 12-stroke Jacket margin.

Jon Baker's championship bid collapsed spectacularly on the final back nine. Leading the Trophy by 6 points entering Round 4, Baker's eagle on the 8th hole seemed to seal victory—then came catastrophic meltdowns on 12 (9 strokes, +6) and 15 (11 strokes, +6) that handed Mullin both titles. Baker had led the Trophy for 49 holes but couldn't sustain his challenge, finishing runner-up by 3 points despite never leading in Gross. Henry Meller's tournament mirrored Baker's volatility: co-leader after Round 2 following a strong 36-point round, then undone by opening with a 12-stroke disaster on the 11th in Round 1 and closing with back-to-back 10-stroke blow-ups in Round 4.

Gregg Williams earned his first career Wooden Spoon, finishing 27 points behind in the Trophy and 71 strokes adrift in Gross. His nightmare week bottomed out in Round 3 with three consecutive 8-stroke blow-ups, and concluded with a career-worst 43-stroke Round 4. In a tournament of attrition—just seven birdies across 360 holes, including a 35-hole drought—Williams managed only one birdie all week while recording 28 worse-than-doubles.
