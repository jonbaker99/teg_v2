# TEG 6: Wire-to-Wire Drama and Championship Collapses {#report-title}

**Catalonia, Spain • 2013**

Gregg Williams secured his first TEG Trophy with a commanding wire-to-wire performance across Catalonia's finest courses, leading 69 of 72 holes despite finishing fifth in the gross competition. His nine-point advantage after an opening 48-point masterclass at PGA Catalunya proved insurmountable, even as a catastrophic final-round collapse threatened to derail his coronation.

David Mullin claimed his fifth Green Jacket in dramatic fashion, reclaiming the lead after Jon Baker's dreams imploded at the ninth hole of the final round. Baker, who had held the Jacket lead for 16 holes, carded a disastrous 10 at the par-four, a sextuple bogey that extinguished both his championship ambitions in a single, brutal moment.

The tournament's defining paradox saw Williams dominate the Stableford competition whilst posting the field's worst gross score of 128-over par. His extraordinary 20-point swing between opening and closing rounds encapsulated the volatility that plagued all five competitors across 72 holes marred by 69 triple-bogeys or worse.

## Round 1: Williams' Statement of Intent {#round-1}

PGA Catalunya's Tour Course provided the stage for Williams' defining performance. His 48-point opening round established the tournament's narrative before the field had barely drawn breath. Two early birdies at the 11th and 14th anchored a back-nine surge worth 28 points, building a commanding nine-point cushion over Baker.

The volatility that would define the week announced itself immediately. Baker's opening-hole triple bogey handed Mullin both leads briefly before a chaotic third saw Williams card seven strokes whilst Stuart Neumann and Williams both registered quintuple-bogeys. By the turn, three players had already produced blow-ups of triple-bogey or worse.

Williams' brilliance shone through the carnage. His front-nine recovery from the third-hole disaster yielded 20 points across the final nine, combining precision with opportunism. Baker's birdie at the 17th salvaged respectability with 26 back-nine points, but the deficit remained substantial. Mullin's steady 17-over-par gross claimed the early Jacket lead, though his Trophy position lagged eight points behind.

Meller's tournament began ominously. A nine at the par-five seventh, followed by another at the 15th, condemned him to last place in both competitions. The pattern was set: Williams dominating net whilst struggling gross, Mullin grinding in both formats, and everyone battling the courses' punishing nature.

## Round 2: Williams Holds Firm Amidst Chaos {#round-2}

Costa Brava's woodland layout offered no respite. Williams' lead survived despite his worst round of the tournament: 36 points and a staggering 32-over-par gross. Consecutive blow-ups at the second, third, seventh, 14th, 15th and 16th holes punctured any momentum, yet his nine-point advantage remained intact.

Meller produced the day's finest performance, his 41-point round matching 17-over-par gross to share the Jacket lead with Mullin. His six-hole stretch through the middle of the round yielded 18 points, including four points at the 12th. The resurgence lifted him from last place but couldn't overcome the first-round damage.

Baker's birdie at the 10th sparked hope before a triple-bogey at the 11th immediately extinguished it. Neumann matched Mullin's 37 points to join the chasing pack at 71 points, 13 behind Williams. The carnage accumulated: Williams alone carded six blow-ups, Baker and Neumann suffered through multiple disasters, and only Mullin's consistency kept the gross competition competitive.

The first-round narrative held: Williams extending his net dominance whilst haemorrhaging strokes, Mullin grinding towards both prizes, and the field collectively battling courses that refused to yield. At halfway, Williams stood 84 points, nine clear of Neumann and Baker on 75, with Mullin lurking on 74 despite leading the Jacket.

## Round 3: Baker Seizes Jacket on Final-Hole Drama {#round-3}

El Prat's Rosa Course delivered the tournament's pivotal moment. Baker's par at the 18th elevated him to the Jacket lead as Mullin's nine strokes and zero points sealed a catastrophic finish to his round. The fourth blow-up in six closing holes cost Mullin dearly: from 63-over entering the 13th, he lurched to 92-over by day's end.

Williams' Trophy lead narrowed to seven points after a 33-point round punctuated by blow-ups at the seventh (where his eight strokes yielded zero points) and throughout the front nine. Baker's balanced 35-point effort, strong on the back nine with 20 points, propelled him to second place overall on 110 points. Neumann's consistency (36 points) maintained his challenge at 107.

The seventh and eighth holes proved ruinous across the board. Williams, Baker and Meller all carded blow-ups at the seventh. The eighth was worse: Meller's 10 strokes for zero points, Baker's nine-stroke disaster, and Mullin's triple-bogey formed a tableau of collapse. Meller's additional quintuple-bogey at the opening hole had effectively ended his Trophy challenge before it began.

Neumann's steady 36 points, the round's best, highlighted his emerging role as the tournament's most consistent performer. His front and back nines balanced perfectly at 18 points each, a rarity in a week defined by wild swings. The stage was set for a tense finale: Williams clinging to a seven-point cushion, Baker leading the Jacket by one stroke, and everyone vulnerable.

## Round 4: Twin Collapses Crown Split Champions {#round-4}

PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course, Spain's premier layout, witnessed extraordinary drama. Williams' Trophy victory survived a 28-point meltdown that saw him briefly lose the lead at the seventh before reclaiming it three holes later. His 41-over-par final round, studded with blow-ups at the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth, 15th, 16th and 18th, would have buried most challengers. The cushion built by his opening brilliance proved decisive.

Baker's Jacket dream died violently at the ninth. Leading by one stroke entering the par-four, his sextuple-bogey 10 handed Mullin the advantage he wouldn't relinquish. Baker briefly regained the lead at the 16th before a closing double-bogey at the 17th and another blow-up at the 18th confirmed his runner-up fate in both competitions.

Mullin's birdie at the fourth announced his intent. His front-nine 19 points contrasted sharply with Williams' 10, yet the Trophy race stayed tight. Even as Williams stumbled through the first six holes averaging close to 3-over per hole, his four points at the 12th steadied the ship. By the time Baker imploded at the ninth, both championships had found their winners.

The final-round carnage epitomised the week. Neumann's blow-ups at the third and sixth accompanied solid play elsewhere for 32 points. Meller's quintuple-bogey at the opening hole set the tone for his 26-point round, cementing his second Wooden Spoon. The Stadium Course extracted revenge on everyone, but Williams' first-round genius had already secured his coronation.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 145 | JB 142 | SN 139 | DM 135 | HM 123  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +85 | JB +89 | SN +97 | HM +118 | GW +128

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Williams' maiden Trophy arrived via the most commanding wire-to-wire performance in tournament history, leading 69 of 72 holes despite posting the worst gross score of all competitors. His 48-point opening statement at PGA Catalunya built a cushion that survived a calamitous 28-point finale, a 20-point swing that encapsulated both his brilliance and the week's volatility. The three-point margin over Baker flattered the runner-up: Williams never truly looked vulnerable until his final-round implosion reduced the advantage from nine points to three.

Mullin's fifth Green Jacket showcased remarkable resilience. His blow-up at the 18th of Round 3 surrendered the Jacket lead to Baker, yet he responded with a composed final round anchored by a birdie at the fourth. Baker's catastrophic sextuple-bogey at the ninth hole, after holding the lead for 16 holes, handed Mullin a four-stroke victory margin that belied the drama of its acquisition.

The tournament's defining statistic: 69 blow-ups of triple-bogey or worse across 72 holes. Nearly one per hole played. Williams contributed 20 blow-ups to that total yet still dominated. Only three birdies were recorded all week, all by the top three finishers. Baker's ninth-hole disaster typified the carnage, a 10 that destroyed both championship bids in a single, brutal moment.

Neumann's consistency earned third in both competitions, his standard deviation of 2.22 points marking him as the week's steadiest performer. Meller's second Wooden Spoon arrived despite producing the tournament's best round in Round 2: 41 points matching 17-over-par gross. His opening-hole disasters in Rounds 3 and 4 proved insurmountable.

## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER SUMMARY

**Gregg Williams (Trophy Winner):** Dominated wire-to-wire with a 48-point masterclass that built an insurmountable cushion. His 20-point swing between opening and closing rounds defined the tournament's volatility. Finished last in the Jacket (128-over) whilst claiming his first Trophy by three points, the format's ultimate paradox.

**Jon Baker (Runner-up, Trophy and Jacket):** Led the Jacket for 16 holes in Round 4 before his sextuple-bogey at the ninth extinguished both championship hopes. His 142 Trophy points and 89-over gross both secured second place, yet the ninth-hole catastrophe will define his tournament. Strong back-nine performances in Rounds 1 and 3 showed resilience amidst the carnage.

**Stuart Neumann (3rd, Trophy and Jacket):** Tournament's most consistent performer, posting 139 points and 97-over gross with minimal volatility. His Round 3 effort (36 points, 22-over) was the day's best when others collapsed. Never threatened for either title but demonstrated steady competence throughout.

**David Mullin (Jacket Winner):** Claimed his fifth Green Jacket with remarkable composure after losing the lead at Round 3's final hole. His birdie at the fourth hole of Round 4 announced his intent, and Baker's implosion at the ninth sealed victory. Finished fourth in the Trophy (135 points) but dominated gross scoring when it mattered, winning by four strokes.

**Henry Meller (Wooden Spoon):** Produced the tournament's best round (Round 2: 41 points, 17-over) yet claimed his second Spoon. Opening-hole disasters in Rounds 3 and 4 (10 and nine strokes respectively) buried any chance of recovery. His 123 Trophy points and 118-over gross left him 16 points adrift of fourth place.
