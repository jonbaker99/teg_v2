Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy in the Algarve, winning by three points over Gregg Williams after a dramatic final round surge. Baker seized control at Hole 13 with back-to-back birdies and never looked back. In a split verdict, David Mullin cruised to his fourth Green Jacket by 12 strokes—yet made history as the first player to simultaneously win the Jacket and earn the Wooden Spoon.

The Trophy race delivered 18 lead changes across five players, with Williams holding a precarious one-point advantage entering the final round. Round 2 saw Stuart Neumann tie the all-time Stableford record with 45 points (matching his +11 gross record with Mullin), but the brilliance proved futile as he finished third. Round 3's finishing stretch produced carnage: triple blow-ups at H17, then back-to-back quintuple bogeys at H18.

Williams, playing for his maiden Trophy, recorded zero birdies all week yet led after 54 holes. Mullin's paradox defined TEG 5—dominant wire-to-wire in the Jacket competition (leading 71 of 72 holes), yet scoring just 136 Stableford points. The tournament returned to Boavista for three rounds before concluding at Palmares' new Praia/Lagos layout.
