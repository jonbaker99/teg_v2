# TEG 10: Baker's Breakthrough After Wire-to-Wire Mullin Dominance {#report-title}

**Algarve, Portugal • 2017**

Alex Baker seized his first TEG Trophy with a nerveless final-round performance across the Algarve coastline, his 51-point flourish on Boavista's return nine separating him from Gregg Williams by 11 points. David Mullin claimed his ninth Green Jacket, a tournament record, leading all 72 holes in gross scoring despite a spectacular mid-tournament Stableford collapse.

The tale of these diverging competitions defined the week. Mullin's wire-to-wire Jacket dominance masked a Trophy implosion, his commanding eight-point lead after Round 1 evaporating through successive rounds of 42, 31, and 40 points. Baker's surge materialised late, averaging 49 points across the final two rounds to overhaul Mullin's early advantage.

John Patterson's tournament descended into historic chaos, his 22-point collapse across four rounds punctuated by 20 zero-point disasters. Williams finished runner-up in both competitions without ever seriously threatening either lead. The tournament marked a five-year return to the Algarve, split between Howard Swan's parkland Boavista and Robert Trent Jones Jr.'s varied Palmares combinations.

## Round 1: Mullin's Triple-Birdie Masterclass {#round-1}

David Mullin established an eight-point Trophy advantage with three birdies in five holes on Boavista's back nine, his 49-point performance anchored by a flawless mid-round stretch. The Jacket race began level, Mullin and Jon Baker both carding 4-over rounds to share the lead.

Mullin's defining sequence unfolded between the 13th and 16th. Birdies at the Par-5 13th and Par-3 14th ignited a run where he averaged level par across six holes. His birdie at the Par-5 16th completed a 20-point six-hole stretch, pulling clear of the field whilst establishing Jacket supremacy.

Alex Baker's round contained contradictions: a blow-up at the Par-3 second and a nine at the Par-5 eighth punctured his progress, yet he recovered to post 41 points and claim second place. Williams carded 38 points despite consecutive disasters at 16 and 18, the latter a ten. Stuart Neumann's round disintegrated spectacularly on the back nine. Blow-ups at 15, 17 and 18 yielded six points from his final six holes, the 18th a horrific ten strokes. Patterson registered zeros at the Par-3 sixth and Par-5 eighth, early signs of trouble ahead.

## Round 2: Mullin Maintains Control Despite Field's Charge {#round-2}

Mullin's five-point Trophy cushion survived Palmares' Praia/Alvor combination despite Williams posting the tournament's best Stableford round. Jon Baker's birdie at the Par-5 second sparked a Jacket surge that lifted him past Mullin into the gross lead at 14-over total.

Williams' 48-point effort was built on a three-hole mid-round sequence. His birdie at the Par-4 tenth, sandwiched between four-point scores at the Par-5 ninth and Par-4 11th, anchored a 12-point stretch. The surge pulled him level with Alex Baker on 86 points total, five behind Mullin.

Alex Baker matched Williams' round points total with 45, his birdie at the Par-5 ninth part of an 11-point three-hole run. His blow-up at the Par-3 16th and seven at the closing hole tempered his challenge. Jon Baker's early momentum was built on consistency, his 27-point front nine including a birdie at the Par-5 second.

Neumann's round collapsed comprehensively across five holes. Consecutive zeros at the 13th, 14th and 15th, followed by a ten at the closing hole, yielded six points from his final six holes. Patterson opened with a ten at the first hole, adding blow-ups at the Par-4 tenth and Par-3 11th to post 35 points.

## Round 3: Lead Changes and Late Drama Shape Closing Day {#round-3}

Five lead changes through 18 holes left Alex Baker and Gregg Williams tied atop the Trophy standings, whilst Mullin reclaimed the Jacket lead despite posting the round's worst Stableford total. The Palmares Alvor/Lagos combination exposed vulnerabilities across the field.

Baker seized the Trophy lead with a four-point score at the Par-5 fourth, Mullin and both Jon Baker and Patterson all carding blow-ups. He extended the advantage at the Par-4 sixth before Mullin briefly recaptured it at the seventh. Baker's own quintuple bogey at the Par-5 13th handed control to Williams, only for Baker to retake it at the Par-5 15th.

Mullin's 31-point collapse was built on sustained mediocrity rather than single catastrophes. He managed just five points across holes 8 through 13, blow-ups at the Par-4 ninth and 11th part of a stretch averaging over 2-over per hole. His birdies at the Par-5s 15th and 17th salvaged respectability, the latter matched by Williams.

Patterson's implosion reached new depths. Quintuples at both the Par-5 eighth and Par-3 12th were surrounded by zeros at the 13th, 14th and 15th. His back nine yielded nine points compared with 18 on the front. Williams' 47 points matched Baker's total, his birdie at 17 part of a level-par three-hole stretch.

**Trophy Standings:** AB 133 | GW 133 | DM 122 | JB 117 | SN 105 | JP 91  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +54 | JB +48 | GW +54 | AB +73 | SN +98 | JP +92

## Round 4: Baker's 51-Point Surge Seals Maiden Triumph {#round-4}

Alex Baker's record-equalling 51-point final round at Boavista secured his maiden Trophy by 11 points, whilst Mullin's 13-over-par effort completed his wire-to-wire Jacket dominance. Williams briefly grabbed the Trophy lead with a birdie at the Par-4 fifth before Baker's relentless consistency buried all challengers.

Baker's defining spell came across holes 5 through 10. Four-point scores at the Par-3 sixth, Par-4 seventh and Par-4 tenth, part of a 21-point six-hole stretch, opened an insurmountable gap. His only blemish came at the Par-4 15th, a seven offsetting four points at the subsequent Par-5 16th.

Williams' challenge evaporated at the Par-3 sixth, his blow-up coinciding with Baker's surge. His four points at the Par-4 tenth briefly suggested resistance before a closing blow-up at 18 sealed second place. Mullin's birdie at the Par-5 16th provided his round's sole highlight, enough to maintain a 12-stroke Jacket cushion over Jon Baker.

Patterson's tournament reached a fittingly chaotic conclusion. Blow-ups at the Par-4s seventh and 17th were punctuated by an 11 at the Par-5 eighth and a nine at the closing hole. His stretch from holes 7 through 12 yielded five points, whilst his final six holes produced six points. The 21-point total completed a four-round descent from 29 to 35 to 27 to 21 points.

**Trophy Standings:** AB 184 | GW 173 | DM 162 | JB 157 | SN 144 | JP 112  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +64 | JB +76 | GW +89 | AB +90 | SN +125 | JP +132

## Tournament Verdict {#recap}

Alex Baker's maiden Trophy arrived via a late surge that overwhelmed David Mullin's early dominance. Leading only 33 of 72 holes, Baker averaged 49 points across the final two rounds whilst Mullin's Stableford challenge dissolved from 91 points at halfway to 122 after three rounds. The 11-point final margin belied the drama of Round 3's five lead changes.

Mullin's ninth Green Jacket, a tournament record, was characterised by unwavering gross consistency. Leading all 72 holes despite his Trophy collapse, his 64-over-par total was 12 strokes clear of Jon Baker. The dichotomy between his Jacket wire-to-wire control and Stableford implosion, dropping from first to third place, defined his tournament.

Williams finished runner-up in both competitions without ever mounting a sustained challenge. His best Stableford round of 48 points came in Round 2, whilst his Jacket campaign peaked with an 87-gross Round 3. Jon Baker led the Jacket briefly in Round 2 before fading to second place, 12 strokes adrift.

Patterson's historic collapse saw him plummet from 29 points in Round 1 to 21 points by Round 4. Twenty zero-point disasters across 72 holes, including quintuples at the Par-5 eighth in Rounds 3 and 4, earned him the Wooden Spoon by 32 points. Neumann avoided his fourth consecutive Spoon despite 11 blow-ups.

Baker's 51-point finale equalled the all-time TEG record, his consistency across the week (41-45-47-51) providing the foundation for his breakthrough. Mullin's six birdies across 72 holes highlighted the scoring difficulties, with only 12 total birdies recorded across 432 holes. The tournament's return to the Algarve after five years produced contrasting narratives: one champion ascending, another consolidating, a third imploding spectacularly.

## Player-by-Player Summary {#player-summary}

**Alex BAKER (1st Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Transformed a five-point halfway deficit into an 11-point victory through sustained excellence across the final 36 holes. His record-equalling 51-point finale at Boavista, featuring a 21-point six-hole stretch from holes 5 through 10, secured his maiden Trophy. Early blow-ups at Round 1's Par-3 second and Par-5 eighth suggested vulnerability before his consistency took control.

**David MULLIN (3rd Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Secured his ninth Green Jacket via wire-to-wire dominance despite a spectacular Stableford collapse. Leading all 72 gross holes by margins never smaller than eight strokes, his 64-over-par total was 12 clear of Jon Baker. His Trophy challenge disintegrated from an eight-point Round 1 lead to third place, successive rounds of 42, 31 and 40 points unable to match his early 49-point brilliance.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Runner-up in both competitions without ever mounting a sustained challenge in either. His tournament-best 48-point Round 2 featured a birdie at the Par-4 tenth, part of a 20-point six-hole stretch. Briefly led the Trophy after 13 holes in Round 3 before Alex Baker's surge left him 11 points adrift.

**Jon BAKER (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Led the Green Jacket after Round 2 following a birdie at the Par-5 second, only to fade across the final 36 holes. His early Jacket advantage evaporated as David Mullin's consistency prevailed, finishing 12 strokes behind. Stableford inconsistency prevented a Trophy challenge, his 45-point Round 2 offset by 35 points in Round 3.

**Stuart NEUMANN (5th Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Avoided his fourth consecutive Wooden Spoon despite 11 zero-point disasters across four rounds. Consecutive blow-ups at Round 1's 15th, 17th and 18th yielded six points from his final six holes, setting a pattern repeated in Round 2 where zeros at 13, 14 and 15 preceded a ten at 18.

**John PATTERSON (6th Trophy, 6th Jacket):** Earned the Wooden Spoon through a historic 22-point four-round collapse punctuated by 20 zero-point disasters. His descent from 29 to 35 to 27 to 21 points was built on quintuples at Round 3's Par-5 eighth and Par-3 12th, matched by an 11 at Round 4's Par-5 eighth. His final six holes in Round 4 produced six points, typical of a tournament defined by chaos.
