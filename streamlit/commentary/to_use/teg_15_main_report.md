**Trophy Winner:** Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd Trophy)  
**Green Jacket Winner:** Gregg WILLIAMS (1st Jacket)  
**Wooden Spoon:** Alex BAKER (2nd Spoon)

---

Gregg Williams claimed his third Trophy and maiden Green Jacket with the most dominant performance in tournament history. Leading from the third hole of Round 1 through to the final putt, Williams won by 21 points in the Stableford and 29 strokes in the gross. Both margins shattered previous records. His Round 3 course record of 44 points at Penha Longa sealed a victory that was never seriously contested after the opening day.

Stuart Neumann delivered a career-best runner-up Trophy finish, posting 136 points despite catastrophic variance. His tournament ended in characteristic chaos: a quintuple bogey at the 18th in Round 4, just moments after a strong front nine had cemented second place. John Patterson clung to third despite three separate blow-ups reaching double figures. Alex Baker collected his second career Wooden Spoon, finishing 43 points adrift.

## Round 1: Early Chaos, Then Williams {#round-1}

The Estoril opener began with multiple lead changes. Jon Baker seized control at the first, his level-par four earning three points and both early leads. Williams' opening disaster, an eight at the same hole, suggested vulnerability. By the third, everything had shifted. Williams' birdie took both competitions, and another at the fourth extended his advantage. Baker's collapse arrived at the 11th: a nine costing him the lead he would never reclaim.

The middle stretch delivered carnage. The 12th hole produced four blow-ups simultaneously, Williams among them with a seven. Baker added nines at both 11 and 12. Neumann's tournament hit rock bottom at the third with a nine, then plunged further at the 15th with a ten. By the turn, only Williams held steady ground.

Baker's misery continued through the back nine. Blow-ups at 15 and 17 buried any lingering ambitions. Williams navigated the finish with control, establishing a five-point cushion. Patterson's strong back nine lifted him to second, whilst Neumann recovered from his early horrors to share third on 31 points, six back from the leader.

## Round 2: West Cliffs Wreckage {#round-2}

Patterson briefly snatched the Trophy lead at West Cliffs' third hole with a five-point birdie. Williams' seven at the same hole suggested cracks. Patterson's joy lasted one hole. By the fourth, Williams had reclaimed control and would never relinquish it. The real story unfolded at the sixth, a Par 5 that produced carnage. Alex Baker's 11 led a procession of disasters: Mullin and Neumann both struck tens, Baker a nine, Patterson an eight. Five simultaneous blow-ups on a single hole.

Williams rebuilt his advantage through solid par golf on holes 4 through 10, gaining seven points whilst others flailed. Neumann's back nine collapsed spectacularly. An 11 at the 13th, followed immediately by a nine at 14, bled 10 crucial points. The 17th delivered final punishment: Jon Baker's tournament-worst 11, plus blow-ups for Alex Baker and Neumann. Mullin's eagle at the 15th provided the round's lone moment of excellence, the only eagle of the tournament.

Williams extended his Trophy lead to nine points over Patterson. His seven-stroke Jacket advantage reflected complete control. Mullin's eagle propelled him to second in the gross standings, whilst Baker's catastrophic 17th saw him slide to fourth, 31 points behind.

## Round 3: Course Record Coronation {#round-3}

Williams produced the tournament's defining performance at Penha Longa. His 44-point round established a course record and created an unbridgeable 18-point gap. Three birdies on the back nine sealed it: the eighth, tenth, and 15th all falling under par. The 10-through-15 stretch yielded 18 points, Williams playing level par whilst accumulating maximum returns.

Neumann matched the course record ambitions with 43 points, his best round of the week. A dominant front nine of 25 points kept him within touching distance. Patterson's round disintegrated on the back nine. An eight at the tenth started the decline, a nine at 16 completed it. His 35 points couldn't prevent a slide in the standings.

Alex Baker's tournament reached its nadir. Three consecutive blow-ups from holes 7 through 8, including a nine at each, preceded the tournament's worst score: a ten at the 14th. His 29 points confirmed last place. Jon Baker's birdie at 13 sparked a late surge to 41 points, moving him to third. Mullin matched that total, his birdie at the second part of a steady 40-point effort.

Williams led by 18 points with one round remaining. His 19-stroke Jacket advantage meant both competitions were effectively settled. The battle for second had intensified, with Baker, Neumann, and Mullin separated by just seven points.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 123 | JB 101 | SN 100 | DM 103 | JP 105 | AB 86  
**Jacket Standings:** GW +43 | JB +69 | DM +60 | SN +100 | JP +79 | AB +102

## Round 4: Oitavos Finale {#round-4}

Williams cruised through Oitavos Dunes with the title secured. His 34 points extended winning margins that had long since become insurmountable. A blow-up at the 18th, a seven when safety was guaranteed, provided the only blemish. The final hole claimed five victims, including Neumann's defining catastrophe.

Neumann's 36 points represented the round's best Stableford performance. His front nine sparkled with 21 points, level par golf through the turn. Then came the 18th. A nine, scoring zero points, transformed what should have been a triumph into familiar chaos. His quintuple bogey epitomised a tournament of wild variance: rounds of 43, 26, 43, and 36 points told the story of brilliance and disaster in equal measure.

Patterson's round began with a ten at the first, his third blow-up reaching double figures. Thirty points kept him in third, though his position owed as much to Mullin's collapse as his own consistency. Mullin's 22 points, his worst round of the week, included blow-ups at the first and 18th. His gross score of 33 over marked a personal nadir. Jon Baker's 30 points secured fourth overall, Alex Baker's 28 confirmed the Wooden Spoon.

Williams' final totals of 157 points and 63 over par represented dominance unseen in tournament history. He led 69 of 72 holes in the Trophy race, 64 of 72 in the Jacket. His 21-point margin over Neumann and 29-stroke advantage over Baker in the gross both established new records.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 157 | SN 136 | JP 135 | JB 131 | DM 125 | AB 114  
**Jacket Standings:** GW +63 | JB +92 | DM +93 | JP +113 | SN +128 | AB +134

## Tournament Recap {#recap}

Williams became the first player to sweep both Trophy and Jacket in the same tournament, doing so with margins that redrew the record books. His 21-point Trophy victory doubled the previous largest gap. Twenty-nine strokes in the gross exceeded all precedent. Leading 69 of 72 Trophy holes meant genuine competition existed for approximately three holes total.

The Round 3 course record at Penha Longa, 44 points from 82 gross strokes, clinched what was already inevitable. Williams' five birdies across four rounds included three in that coronation performance. His consistency proved as impressive as his peaks: only seven blow-ups all week, compared to 13 apiece for both Baker brothers and 81 tournament-wide.

Neumann's runner-up finish represented his best Trophy result, though the manner of achievement fitted his reputation. Career-best placement achieved via rounds of 43-26-43-36 points, the variance bordering on absurd. His H18 finale, that quintuple bogey with second place secured, encapsulated a week lurching between excellence and chaos.

Patterson's third place survived three catastrophic blow-ups, including quintuples in Rounds 1 and 4. Baker finished fourth despite that tournament-worst 11 at H17 in Round 2. Mullin's fifth-place Trophy showing, third in the Jacket, felt underwhelming given his usual standards. One eagle, scored at H15 in Round 2, provided his sole genuine highlight.

Alex Baker's second Wooden Spoon arrived via 13 blow-ups and a 43-point deficit. His quintuple at H14 in Round 3, a ten on a Par 4, tied for tournament-worst alongside Neumann's H15 disaster in Round 1. Eighty-one blow-ups across six players suggested Portugal's courses extracted full punishment for wayward shots. Only eight birdies total, including Mullin's lone eagle, reinforced the week's brutal nature.

Williams' wire-to-wire sweep, achieved with record margins across both competitions, marked the most comprehensive individual dominance in tournament history. His third Trophy and maiden Jacket, won simultaneously, established a benchmark unlikely to be matched.

## Player-by-Player Summary {#player-summary}

**Gregg Williams (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Wire-to-wire domination in both competitions, leading 69 of 72 Trophy holes and 64 of 72 Jacket holes. Record-breaking 21-point Trophy margin and 29-stroke Jacket advantage both rewrote tournament history. Round 3 course record of 44 points at Penha Longa, featuring three back-nine birdies, sealed victory that was never seriously contested after Round 1.

**Stuart Neumann (2nd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Career-best Trophy finish achieved through extreme variance. Rounds of 43-26-43-36 points showcased brilliance and chaos in equal measure. H18 quintuple bogey finale, scoring nine strokes and zero points with second place secured, epitomised a week lurching between excellence and disaster.

**John Patterson (3rd Trophy, 6th Jacket):** Held third Trophy position despite three catastrophic blow-ups reaching double figures. Quintuples at H1 Round 4 and H16 Round 3, plus opening-hole disasters throughout, tested patience. Thirty points in final round sufficient to maintain position as others collapsed.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Best Jacket finish couldn't compensate for Trophy disappointment. Tournament-worst 11 at H17 Round 2, plus 13 total blow-ups, undermined otherwise solid gross performance. Fourth Trophy placing, second Jacket result highlighted split between competitions.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Disappointing finish given usual standards. Lone tournament eagle at H15 Round 2 provided only genuine highlight. Personal-worst final round of 22 points, including 33-over gross score, dropped him from Trophy contention to fifth.

**Alex Baker (6th Trophy, 6th Jacket):** Second career Wooden Spoon via 13 blow-ups and 43-point deficit. Quintuple at H14 Round 3, scoring ten on Par 4, tied for tournament-worst. Never threatened genuine competition across either format.
