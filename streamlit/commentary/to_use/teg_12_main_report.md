## At-a-Glance {.at-a-glance}

**Trophy Winner:** Jon PATTERSON (2nd Trophy)  
**Jacket Winner:** Jon BAKER (2nd Jacket)  
**Wooden Spoon:** David MULLIN (1st Spoon)

Jon Patterson claimed his second Trophy title through four rounds of spectacular volatility across Catalonia's championship courses. The victory came via a commanding ten-point margin, yet the route contained enough drama for an entire season: thirty-two lead changes, two quintuple bogeys, and the tournament's most erratic scoring patterns in recent memory.

Jon Baker swept all four Gross rounds to secure his second Green Jacket by eight strokes. He led from the opening tee through seventy-two holes, never once threatening the Trophy lead but establishing wire-to-wire dominance in the parallel competition. His final-round 89 at Stadium set a new course record.

The peculiar mathematics of dual-format golf produced its rarest outcome: David Mullin finished runner-up in the Jacket whilst collecting the Wooden Spoon, becoming only the second player to achieve this paradox. Stuart Neumann provided the week's singular moment of brilliance with an eagle at the 15th in Round 4, the tournament's only eagle across seventy-two holes.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos {.round-1}

The Tour Course opened with immediate chaos. Patterson took both leads at the first before hemorrhaging eight strokes at the fourth, a twelve that removed him from contention by the fifth hole. Alex Baker registered zeros at the opening two holes, plummeting to the Spoon position inside eighteen minutes.

Gregg Williams capitalised on the carnage, seizing control through steady accumulation whilst others imploded. His birdie at the 14th pushed him clear. Patterson recovered spectacularly through the middle stretch, reeling off twelve points across holes eight through ten to wrestle back into contention. His three at the 15th reclaimed the Trophy lead.

Williams snatched it back at the 16th. Baker's birdie at the 14th secured the Jacket lead he would never relinquish. Stuart Neumann's round contained three disasters exceeding six strokes, including a twelve at the 15th that capsized what had been a respectable showing.

Williams closed with a three at the 18th to win the round with 46 points, one clear of Patterson. Baker shared the Gross lead at twelve over par.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 46 | JP 45 | JB 40 | SN 36 | DM 35 | AB 34  
**Green Jacket Standings:** GW +12 | JB +12 | DM +17 | JP +24 | AB +30 | SN +33

## Round 2: Tour Twice {.round-2}

Williams held firm through the opening stretch before an eight at the fourth cost him the Jacket lead. His birdie at the tenth briefly restored it before Baker reclaimed control with a two at the 11th. Baker's response to that gain was immediate and catastrophic: a seven at the 12th that bled three precious points.

Patterson's nightmare arrived at the 15th. A ten there, five over par, vanished any momentum he'd built. Williams profited, retaking the Trophy lead whilst Patterson spiralled. The pendulum swung twice more before the final green.

Neumann produced the round's finest scoring with 44 points despite ranking fourth in Gross. His birdie at the sixth sparked a six-hole stretch yielding nineteen points. Alex Baker's front nine disintegrated through holes seven through nine, registering just one point, before a back-nine recovery featuring a birdie at the tenth salvaged 23 points.

Williams clung to a one-point Trophy advantage. Baker's sixteen-stroke round matched Williams' Gross total, extending his Jacket lead to twelve strokes.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 88 | JP 87 | SN 80 | JB 76 | AB 71 | DM 75  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +28 | DM +29 | GW +28 | JP +48 | SN +54 | AB +54

## Round 3: Stadium Carnage {.round-3}

The Stadium Course shredded reputations. Patterson opened with a five that restored his Trophy lead. Williams snatched it back at the second before Patterson's quintuple bogey at the third, a ten that should have finished his challenge.

Williams' celebration lasted one hole. His nine at the fourth, five over par and bleeding all his points, handed the lead straight back to Patterson. The pair traded blows through the front nine like exhausted heavyweights. Alex Baker registered consecutive zeros at the second and fourth, his challenge evaporating.

Then Williams collapsed comprehensively. His eight at the 12th preceded an eleven at the 13th, seven over par, that obliterated any remaining hope. Those two holes yielded zero points, a double catastrophe that ended his tournament. Patterson's birdie at the 15th sealed an eight-point cushion heading to the final round.

Baker's birdie at the 12th and steady eighteen-stroke round extended his Jacket lead to nineteen strokes over Mullin. Williams' 28-stroke disaster dropped him to second in Trophy standings.

**Trophy Standings:** JP 132 | GW 124 | SN 115 | JB 110 | DM 105 | AB 103  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +46 | DM +51 | GW +56 | JP +71 | AB +83 | SN +84

## Round 4: Record and Ruin {.round-4}

Patterson stumbled from the gates with a triple bogey but his eight-point cushion absorbed the blow. Williams chased gamely, his birdie at the seventh briefly threatening before Patterson steadied. The volatility that defined his week never truly endangered the outcome.

Neumann authored the tournament's signature moment at the 15th: an eagle three, the week's only eagle across seventy-two holes. That five-pointer capped a back-nine recovery of 23 points after a front-nine 17. Mullin's consecutive birdies at the 12th and 14th provided brief respite from a round that confirmed his Wooden Spoon destiny despite finishing second in Gross.

Baker closed with an 89 at the Stadium, seventeen over par, setting a new course record in the process. His wire-to-wire Jacket victory came by eight strokes despite never once leading the Trophy competition. The seventeen-stroke round secured his second Green Jacket with minimal drama.

Patterson's 40-point finale, matched by Alex Baker and Neumann, delivered the Trophy by ten points over Williams. His week featured quintuple bogeys, multiple disasters, and thirty-two lead changes, yet the outcome never genuinely wavered after Round 3's carnage.

**Trophy Standings:** JP 172 | GW 162 | SN 155 | JB 145 | AB 143 | DM 139  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +63 | DM +71 | GW +76 | JP +96 | AB +104 | SN +108

## Tournament Verdict {.recap}

Jon Patterson's second Trophy arrived through survival rather than mastery. He led forty-eight of seventy-two holes whilst enduring scoring volatility that would sink lesser champions. His quintuple bogey at Round 3's third hole somehow didn't derail him; the ten at Round 2's 15th merely punctuated a performance defined by resilience rather than consistency. Thirty-two lead changes across the week tell the story: Patterson won because he outlasted the chaos he helped create.

Williams' tournament narrative reads like Greek tragedy. Leading thirty-three holes, more than any other player, his title credentials evaporated in Round 3's cataclysmic stretch at holes twelve and thirteen. An eight followed by an eleven, fourteen strokes across two holes without registering a point, transformed comfortable leader into distant runner-up. His ten-point deficit at close flattered him; the margin could have been twenty.

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire Jacket dominance provided the week's sole predictability. Leading all seventy-two Gross holes, his final-round course record at the Stadium capped a performance of metronomic consistency. His 145 Trophy points ranked fourth, a reminder that Gross supremacy and Stableford success operate in parallel universes.

David Mullin's Wooden Spoon arrival alongside second-place Jacket finish marks only the second occurrence of this paradox in tournament history. His 139 Trophy points, dead last, contrasted brutally with his +71 Gross total, just eight strokes behind Baker. The format's absurdity never revealed itself more starkly.

Stuart Neumann's eagle at the 15th in Round 4 stands as the tournament's rarest achievement: the only eagle across four rounds on courses that yielded just twelve birdies and fifty-two disasters worse than double bogey. That three at a par five epitomised a week where survival trumped excellence, where consistency mattered less than avoiding catastrophe, and where Patterson's volatility somehow proved the winning formula.

## Player-by-Player Summary {.player-summary}

**Jon PATTERSON (1st):** Claimed his second Trophy through spectacular chaos, leading 48 of 72 holes whilst surviving two quintuple bogeys and 32 lead changes. His Round 3 surge created an eight-point cushion that absorbed the final-round wobbles, ultimately winning by ten points despite gross scoring that ranked fourth.

**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd):** Led 33 holes, more than anyone, before Round 3's back-to-back disasters at holes 12 and 13 obliterated his title hopes. Those fourteen strokes without registering a point transformed comfortable leader into distant runner-up. His 162 points flattered what became a cautionary tale.

**Stuart NEUMANN (3rd):** Recorded the tournament's only eagle in Round 4, a moment of brilliance amid consistent volatility. His 155 points secured third despite gross scoring that ranked last. The eagle at the 15th epitomised a week where Stableford magic trumped conventional excellence.

**Jon BAKER (4th, Jacket Winner):** Swept all four Gross rounds in wire-to-wire dominance, leading 58 of 72 Jacket holes. His final-round course record 89 at the Stadium capped the most predictable storyline of the week. Never threatened the Trophy lead but established Jacket supremacy from the opening tee.

**Alex BAKER (5th):** Opened with consecutive zeros before recovering to challenge intermittently. His 40-point final round couldn't overcome earlier inconsistency. Finished nineteen strokes behind brother Jon in Gross, a gulf that defined their contrasting fortunes.

**David MULLIN (6th, Wooden Spoon):** Finished second in the Jacket by eight strokes yet collected the Spoon, becoming only the second player to achieve this paradox. His 139 Trophy points, dead last, contrasted brutally with his +71 Gross performance, exposing the format's peculiar mathematics.
