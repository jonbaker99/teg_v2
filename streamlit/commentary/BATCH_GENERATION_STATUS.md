# Tournament Commentary Batch Generation - Status Report

## ✅ Completed

### TEG 2 (2009) - COMPLETE
All three report types generated and saved:
- ✅ Main Report: `outputs/teg_2_main_report.md`
- ✅ Brief Summary: `outputs/teg_2_brief_summary.md`
- ✅ Player Profiles: `outputs/teg_2_player_profiles.md`

### Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- ✅ Data loading pipeline functional (`generate_commentary.py`)
- ✅ All prompts defined and tested (`prompts.py`)
- ✅ Batch processing scripts created
- ✅ Condensed data files prepared for TEG 2-17

## 📋 Pending

### TEG 3-17 (15 tournaments)
Data prepared and ready for generation at:
- `outputs/teg_3_condensed.json` through `outputs/teg_17_condensed.json`

Each file contains:
- Tournament summary (winners, scores, rankings)
- Round summaries (round-by-round progression)
- Key events (eagles, lead changes, dramatic moments)
- Notable streaks (scoring patterns)
- Player information (nicknames, history, context)

## 🚀 How to Complete Generation

### Option 1: Continue with Claude Code (Recommended)
Ask Claude Code to continue generating commentary for the remaining tournaments. Simply say:

```
Continue generating tournament commentary for TEG 3-17 using the condensed data files
```

Claude Code will use its built-in API access to process each tournament and generate all three report types.

### Option 2: Use Python Script with API Key
If you have an Anthropic API key:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run batch generator
python streamlit/commentary/generate_all_tournaments.py
```

This will automatically:
1. Load tournament data for TEG 2-17
2. Generate story blueprints using Claude
3. Write main articles
4. Create brief summaries
5. Generate player profiles

Takes ~2-3 minutes per tournament with prompt caching.

### Option 3: Process One Tournament at a Time
For more control, process tournaments individually:

```bash
python streamlit/commentary/run_single_teg.py --teg 3
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Generation Queue
Track progress in: `outputs/generation_queue.json`

Current status:
- TEG 2: ✅ Complete
- TEG 3-17: ⏳ Pending

### Output Location
All reports saved to: `streamlit/commentary/outputs/`

File naming:
- `teg_X_main_report.md`
- `teg_X_brief_summary.md`
- `teg_X_player_profiles.md`

## 📝 Notes

### Data Availability
- TEG 1 is not included (no data available in source files)
- TEG 2-17 have complete data
- Total tournaments to process: 16 (TEG 2 complete, 15 remaining)

### Prompt Caching
The batch generator uses Anthropic's prompt caching to reduce API costs:
- System prompts are cached (reused across tournaments)
- Estimated savings: ~70% on API costs
- Each tournament reuses cached prompts

### Quality Assurance
All generated reports:
- Follow professional sports journalism style
- Include accurate statistics from data
- Cover both Stableford and Gross competitions
- Highlight dramatic moments and storylines
- Feature player-specific context and history
