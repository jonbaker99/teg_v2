His victory margin of eleven points suggests dominance until you consider that 184 Stableford points across 72 holes represents the golfing equivalent of successfully completing a difficult crossword by only getting 40% wrong. David Mullin claimed his eighth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire authority, leading all 72 holes in gross competition whilst finishing third in Stableford, a statistical phenomenon that perfectly captures amateur golf's beautiful absurdism.\n\nThe tournament's emotional arc peaked on Round 4 when John Patterson authored a sextuple bogey on Boavista's eighth hole, the sixth catastrophic blow-up in his final eighteen holes. This represented not so much a collapse as a scorecards-led descent into numerical nihilism. Gregg Williams co-led entering the final round before recording what medical professionals would term \"a complete psychological unraveling\" on holes one, six, and eighteen. The Algarve sunshine served as witness to this theatre of voluntary suffering, returned to after a five-TEG absence that nobody had particularly mourned.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**Alex Baker (1st Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Conquered his previous runner-up curse through the time-honoured method of shooting between 41 and 51 points in every round, which in amateur golf constitutes iron consistency. Suffered a quintuple bogey on Round 3's thirteenth that briefly threatened his ambitions before remembering that everyone else was equally hopeless. His breakthrough feels less like scaling Everest and more like winning a particularly fraught game of Jenga.\n\n**Gregg Williams (2nd Trophy):** Posted the tournament's best round (48 points) whilst ultimately finishing eleven behind, which suggests either terrible timing or chronic inconsistency. Led entering the final day before blow-ups on holes one, six, and eighteen transformed co-leadership into runner-up with the efficiency of a controlled demolition. Continues to occupy the space between genuine competence and self-sabotage.\n\n**David Mullin (3rd Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Won the Green Jacket by twelve strokes whilst never holding the Trophy lead after Round 2, a statistical quirk that reveals the TEG's dual-competition structure as either beautifully democratic or fundamentally absurd. His opening 49 points suggested brilliance; subsequent rounds averaging 38 points suggested mortality. Three birdies per round indicate someone playing actual golf rather than merely surviving it.\n\n**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Finished runner-up in the Jacket by twelve strokes, which sounds respectable until you note the quintuple bogeys littering his card like forensic evidence. His tournament followed the classic pattern of occasional competence punctuated by holes that would make the RSPCA investigate if balls had feelings. Seventeen points behind the Trophy winner suggests proximity; the reality was existential distance.\n\n**Stuart Neumann (5th):** Recorded eleven zero-point holes across four rounds, which represents statistical consistency in the wrong direction entirely. His final round 39 points came too late to matter, like remembering an excellent comeback three days after the argument. Zero birdies across 72 holes suggests a relationship with par based entirely on unfulfilled aspiration.\n\n**John Patterson (6th, Wooden Spoon):** Authored the tournament's narrative masterpiece: a sextuple bogey on the final round's eighth hole, his second quintuple-or-worse of the back nine after the twelfth hole's similar disaster. Twenty zero-point holes across the tournament represents not so much bad golf as active warfare against the scorecard. Seventy-two points behind the winner feels less like a margin and more like a different sport entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1: The Boavista Baptism {.round1 .round}\n\nThe return to Boavista after a five-TEG absence felt less like homecoming and more like revisiting the scene of historical trauma. The Portuguese sunshine illuminated not optimism but the full horrors of what was about to unfold. David Mullin's opening statement—49 points including three birdies—suggested someone playing an entirely different game to the rest of the field.\n\nAlex Baker's round began with a quadruple bogey on the second, the sort of hole that prompts searching questions about life choices. He recovered with admirable stubbornness to post 41 points, eight behind Mullin, which in context felt less like disaster and more like damage limitation. Stuart Neumann scattered five zero-point holes across his opening eighteen like someone playing scorecard bingo, whilst Jon Baker led briefly on the ninth before reality reasserted itself with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe carnage concentrated on the par threes, which operated as mandatory tributes to golf's essential cruelty. The eighteenth witnessed a three-way blow-up featuring Williams, Neumann, and Patterson that suggested collective breakdown rather than individual failure. Mullin's birdie run from the thirteenth through sixteenth—three in four holes—represented genuinely impressive golf, which made everyone else's efforts look like performance art exploring futility.\n\nBy round's end, Mullin held an eight-point cushion that felt less like comfort and more like a small ledge halfway up a collapsing cliff face. His gross score of four over par whispered quality; everyone else's numbers screamed desperation. The lead had changed hands multiple times across the opening holes before Mullin seized control, which is the TEG way: chaos before hierarchy.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> DM 49 | AB 41 | GW 38 | JB 37 | SN 32 | JP 29</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +4 | JB +18 | GW +25 | AB +28 | JP +31 | SN +36</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: The Palmares Praia Inquisition {.round2 .round}\n\nThe new course at Palmares brought fresh tortures disguised as scenic variety. The links/parkland hybrid offered multiple ways to fail, and the field embraced every opportunity with enthusiasm bordering on self-harm. Gregg Williams authored a monster 48-point round that catapulted him into second place, proof that occasionally someone remembers how golf theoretically works.\n\nJohn Patterson opened with a ten on the first hole—six over par—which functioned less as bad start and more as philosophical statement about his tournament's direction. His subsequent triple bogey on the tenth and blow-up on the eleventh suggested someone actively researching the limits of Stableford's scoring system. Alex Baker's birdie on the ninth represented a brief moment of actual golf before the sixteenth's blow-up reminded him of his place in the natural order.\n\nDavid Mullin's 42 points maintained his five-point Trophy lead whilst extending his Jacket dominance, the sort of dual-competition management that suggests intelligence as much as skill. Stuart Neumann's consecutive zero-pointers on thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen represented not so much cold spell as meteorological apocalypse. The first hole alone witnessed a ten, two sevens, and assorted sixes, as if the course was conducting entrance examinations everyone failed.\n\nWilliams' hot stretch from holes eight through eleven—twelve points including a birdie—showed what happens when competence and confidence briefly align. His 48-point round set the tournament's single-round standard, though contextualized by subsequent events, this feels less like achievement and more like false advertising. The standings showed Mullin still leading both competitions, but the margins were narrowing like a noose.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> DM 91 | AB 86 | GW 86 | JB 82 | SN 69 | JP 64</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +15 | JB +28 | GW +39 | AB +51 | JP +56 | SN +69</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: The Palmares Alvor Massacre {.round3 .round}\n\nThe fully parkland Palmares combination brought tree-lined fairways and strategic water, which in practice meant more creative ways to lose golf balls. Alex Baker seized the Trophy lead on the fourth hole's par five, overtaking Mullin through the simple method of not posting a zero. The lead changed hands with the frequency of a tennis match, seven times across the opening fifteen holes, before Baker seized control for good.\n\nJohn Patterson's twin quintuple bogeys on the eighth and twelfth represented golf as existential horror rather than recreational sport. Both holes yielded zero points, which on Stableford's generous system requires genuine catastrophe. His front nine eighteen points collapsed to a back nine nine points, the sort of numerical decline usually reserved for financial crashes. The fifteenth's quadruple bogey suggested someone actively seeking the tournament's statistical basement.\n\nBaker's own quintuple bogey on the thirteenth briefly threatened his Trophy ambitions before Williams' simultaneous blow-up proved everyone was suffering equally. Mullin's birdies on fifteen and seventeen showed flashes of competence amid the chaos, though his zero-pointers on four, nine, eleven, thirteen, and eighteen suggested mortality was winning. His 31-point round dropped him to third in Stableford whilst maintaining Jacket dominance, a split personality performance that captured the tournament's essential weirdness.\n\nThe round ended with Baker and Williams deadlocked atop the Trophy leaderboard, a statistical photo finish heading into the final eighteen. Mullin's gross lead remained unthreatened despite his Stableford collapse, which is the TEG way: one competition's disaster is another's procession. Jon Baker's recovery from early blow-ups showed resilience; Patterson's late implosion showed surrender.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> AB 133 | GW 133 | DM 122 | JB 117 | SN 105 | JP 91</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +38 | JB +48 | GW +54 | AB +73 | SN +98 | JP +92</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: The Boavista Reckoning {.round4 .round}\n\nAlex Baker's closing 51 points set a new all-time TEG single-round record, which sounds impressive until you remember that Stableford points are essentially participation trophies with mathematical structure. His victory march featured four-point hauls on holes six, seven, and ten—consecutive pars rendered heroic by context—before a quintuple bogey on fifteen briefly threatened to make things interesting. Williams' simultaneous collapse removed all drama.\n\nJohn Patterson's sextuple bogey on the eighth hole—eleven strokes, six over par, zero points—represented not merely bad golf but active psychological warfare against himself. His quadruple bogey on the tenth and blow-ups on seventeen and eighteen suggested someone who'd stopped pretending to care around hole seven. Six catastrophic holes across the final round is less a performance and more a cry for help disguised as sport.\n\nGregg Williams' co-leadership lasted precisely one hole before a bogey on the first signaled what was coming. His birdie on the fifth briefly rekindled hope before blow-ups on six and eighteen bookended his round like tragic punctuation marks. Starting the day tied for the lead and finishing eleven points behind represents the sort of collapse that requires professional counseling or at least a lengthy pub session.\n\nDavid Mullin's 40-point final round secured his eighth Green Jacket by twelve strokes, a margin suggesting dominance until you note his wire-to-wire Jacket lead contrasted with never holding the Trophy lead after Round 2. His birdie on the sixteenth showed class; Baker's four-point streak from holes six through ten showed hunger. The final standings revealed what four rounds of Portuguese golf produces: one breakthrough winner, one wire-to-wire Jacket champion, and four players contemplating their life choices.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> AB 184 | GW 173 | DM 162 | JB 157 | SN 144 | JP 112</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +51 | JB +63 | GW +76 | AB +90 | SN +125 | JP +132</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nAlex Baker's maiden Trophy victory arrived via the least dramatic route possible: consistent mediocrity beating everyone else's spectacular inconsistency. His scores of 41-45-47-51 showed someone slowly figuring out Portuguese golf's particular cruelties, though \"figuring out\" might be generous when 184 total points across 72 holes represents roughly 2.5 points per hole. His breakthrough ended a three-tournament runner-up streak that must have felt less like near-misses and more like cosmic mockery.\n\nDavid Mullin's eighth Green Jacket came through wire-to-wire dominance that never translated to Trophy leadership, a split performance that perfectly captures amateur golf's beautiful absurdism. Leading all 72 holes in gross competition whilst finishing third in Stableford suggests either tactical brilliance or fundamental confusion about which competition matters. His final margin of twelve strokes whispered quality; his Stableford fade to third screamed human.\n\nThe tournament's lasting image belongs to John Patterson's final-round sextuple bogey, the sixth catastrophic hole in his closing eighteen and twentieth zero-pointer of the tournament. Finishing seventy-two points behind the winner represents not merely bad golf but an entirely different relationship with the sport, one based on suffering rather than recreation. His Wooden Spoon came with historical context: every round set new personal worsts.\n\nGregg Williams' collapse from co-leader to eleven points back tells its own story about golf's essential cruelty, whilst Jon Baker's runner-up finishes in both competitions suggest someone perpetually close but never quite there. The Algarve sunshine witnessed all this with Mediterranean indifference, which feels appropriate: these are self-inflicted wounds wearing Stableford's bureaucratic formatting.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\n### All-Time TEG Records\n- **Stableford (Single Round):** Alex Baker 51pts (TEG 10, R4)\n- **Gross (Single Round):** David Mullin +4 (TEG 10, R1)\n\n### Personal Bests\n- **Alex Baker:** Stableford 51pts (R4); Gross +17 (R4)\n- **David Mullin:** Stableford 49pts (R1); Gross +4 (R1)\n- **Gregg Williams:** Stableford 48pts (R2); Gross +14 (R2)\n- **Jon Baker:** Gross +10 (R2)\n\n### Personal Worsts\n- **John Patterson:** Stableford 21pts (R4); Gross +40 (R4)\n  - *All four rounds set new personal worst marks*\n\n### Course Records\n- **Boavista:** David Mullin 75 gross (TEG 10, R1)\n  - *New course record at this venue*\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n### Consistency Metrics\nThe ten-point spread between Alex Baker's best and worst rounds (41-51) proved decisive against Gregg Williams' identical range (38-48) that somehow arrived at different places. John Patterson's nineteen-point collapse from Round 2's respectable 35 to Round 4's catastrophic 21 suggests someone whose relationship with golf is fundamentally unstable. David Mullin's eighteen-point drop from opening 49 to closing 40 showed even quality suffers in the Algarve.\n\n### Catastrophic Hole Distribution\nTwenty zero-point holes for Patterson across four rounds averages five per eighteen, which represents statistical consistency in precisely the wrong direction. His six blow-ups in the final round alone constitutes one-third of all holes played, the sort of ratio that prompts existential questions. Stuart Neumann's eleven zero-pointers finished distant second in this particular competition nobody wants to win.\n\n### Lead Changes and Final Margins\nSeven Trophy lead changes through Round 3 before Baker's final-day breakaway suggests a tournament defined more by others' collapses than his dominance. His eleven-point victory margin looks comfortable until you remember he was tied entering the final round. Williams' simultaneous implosion handed Baker the Trophy as much as Baker seized it, which is amateur golf's essential truth: victories arrive via others' failures.\n\n### Front Nine vs Back Nine Patterns\nRound 1 saw three players post stronger back nines (Mullin, Baker, Patterson) whilst two started strong (J. Baker, Neumann), suggesting Boavista operates as slow torture rather than immediate cruelty. Round 4's remarkable balance—everyone within three points between nines—indicates either course fairness or universal suffering. These patterns matter deeply to precisely nobody."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10063,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4092,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}

Over four days in Catalonia, Jon BAKER conducted a masterclass in not collapsing, claiming both Trophy and Green Jacket with the administrative efficiency of a man who'd simply decided winning was less stressful than the alternative. He led for 59 of 72 holes in the Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross scoring, establishing what behavioural psychologists would call \"dominance\" and what everyone else would call \"deeply annoying.\"\n\nAlex BAKER, having mounted the only serious challenge, saved his best work for Round 4 where he posted a career-worst 27 points featuring five triple-bogeys. This represents the golfing equivalent of writing your resignation letter in crayon. Gregg WILLIAMS lurked perpetually in third, never quite leading but never quite imploding, which in TEG terms counts as heroic restraint. David MULLIN earned the Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in gross scoring, proof that excellence in the wrong metric is just failure with better posture.\n\nThe return to Catalonia after a five-tournament absence posed questions nobody had asked. Would PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course still be punishing? Yes. Would the new venture to El Prat's Azul Course provide respite? Absolutely not. Would anyone shoot under 82 for a single round? No. Did Jon BAKER equal the course record with an 84 in Round 2? He did, though describing 12-over-par as a record suggests our standards have drifted into medical concern territory.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**Jon BAKER (Winner, Trophy & Green Jacket):** The wire-to-wire sweep arrived with the emotional affect of a man paying council tax. Two birdies across 72 holes, a Round 2 course-equalling 84, and the psychological warfare of never, ever relinquishing control. His R4 blow-up on the 13th briefly threatened drama before he remembered he was leading by enough to afford recreational catastrophe.\n\n**Alex BAKER (2nd, Trophy):** Led the Trophy standings on exactly two occasions, H1 and H13 of Round 3, both times for roughly as long as it takes to read this sentence. His Round 4 meltdown featured nine zero-point holes and five triple-bogeys, suggesting his short game underwent spontaneous philosophical collapse. Finished six points back having authored the tournament's most compelling tragedy in Stableford scoring.\n\n**Gregg WILLIAMS (3rd, Trophy):** Two birdies, zero leads, permanent third place. The human embodiment of \"steady away\" played every round between 30 and 39 points, which in amateur golf circles counts as terrifying consistency. His Round 2 blow-up at the 15th (a 10) and birdie at the 17th within three holes captured the essential TEG experience: chaos bookended by competence.\n\n**John PATTERSON (4th, Trophy):** Posted the tournament's best Stableford round (36, R4) immediately after opening with the worst (26, R1). Eight blow-ups in Round 1 alone, including consecutive train wrecks at holes 12, 13, 16, and 17. His scorecard reads like a seismograph during an earthquake, all volatility and no pattern. Led the Trophy for exactly four holes across four rounds, which is four more than most people manage in a lifetime.\n\n**David MULLIN (5th, Trophy / Wooden Spoon):** Finished second in gross scoring but dead last in Stableford, earning the Spoon via the cruelest mathematical logic. Two birdies, multiple stretches of even-par golf, and a Round 3 where he briefly led the Jacket before reality intervened. His tournament arc resembled a man building an intricate sand sculpture during high tide.\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 1: THE OPTIMISM PURGE {.round1 .round}\n\nPGA Catalunya's Stadium Course opened proceedings with the cheerful aggression of a dental procedure. This is Spain's premier golf course, a World Top 100 layout designed by the European Tour specifically to make professionals feel mortal. For amateurs, it functions as an 18-hole philosophy seminar on accepting human limitation.\n\nJohn PATTERSON took the Trophy lead at the first hole with four points, which in retrospect represented Peak Ambition. By the fourth, he'd blown up with a nine. By the 13th, he'd added three more catastrophes and sat bottom in the Spoon race, having compiled eight blow-ups before most people have finished breakfast. His front nine produced 17 points. His back nine: nine. The differential suggests someone had swapped his golf clubs for plumbing equipment at the turn.\n\nGregg WILLIAMS opened with a triple-bogey seven at the first, bottoming out in the Spoon standings before rallying with a birdie at the 15th, then immediately undoing the good work with another triple at the 16th. This is the TEG emotional cycle: hope, achievement, punishment. Alex BAKER blow-ups at the 2nd, 11th, and 13th kept him honest. Jon BAKER, meanwhile, constructed a 35-point round with the quiet brutality of someone who'd done the maths and realised nobody else had.\n\nThe round concluded with Jon leading by three points, Dave McDOWELL lurking in the Jacket chase, and John PATTERSON having posted six zero-point holes. The Stadium Course had spoken. Everyone had heard.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 35 | AB 32 | GW 30 | DM 29 | JP 26</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +18 | DM +20 | AB +28 | GW +29 | JP +40</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 2: THE RECORD THAT WASN'T {.round2 .round}\n\nThe Tour Course at PGA Catalunya represented Round 2's assignment, marginally less sadistic than its Stadium sibling but only in the way being hit by a van is marginally preferable to being hit by a lorry. Jon BAKER tied the course record with an 84, twelve strokes over par, which tells you everything about the tournament's relationship with conventional excellence.\n\nAlex BAKER posted the round's best Stableford (42 points) before authoring the afternoon's defining moment at the 12th: a nine, five over par, zero points. This dropped him from second to second, which is mathematically fascinating and emotionally devastating. He'd opened with four-point scores at the 3rd, 8th, and 13th, building momentum before the universe reminded him that hope is structural weakness. Jon BAKER birdied the 2nd alongside David MULLIN, who added another at the 10th in a rare display of Gross scoring competence that would later prove cosmically irrelevant.\n\nJohn PATTERSON contributed five blow-ups including an 11 at the 15th, which represents less a golf hole and more a personal intervention. His scorecard resembled a ransomware note. Gregg WILLIAMS blow-up at the 15th (a 10) preceded a birdie at the 17th, capturing the essential futility of golf: punishment, then redemption, then remembering nobody cares.\n\nJon BAKER extended his Trophy lead to two points while maintaining the Jacket advantage. His 84 equalled the course record, though describing it as such feels like awarding a participation trophy to mathematics itself.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 76 | AB 74 | GW 69 | DM 65 | JP 60</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +30 | DM +33 | AB +48 | GW +49 | JP +71</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 3: THE BRIEF COUP {.round3 .round}\n\nEl Prat's Azul Course made its TEG debut, a Greg Norman design that introduced itself with the warmth of a parking fine. Alex BAKER seized the Trophy lead at the first hole before losing it at the second via a triple-bogey six at a par three. This 18-hole span of leadership represents what military historians would call \"premature commitment.\"\n\nDavid MULLIN grabbed the Jacket lead at the third, lost it at the sixth following his own par-3 blow-up (a seven). Jon BAKER reclaimed control and refused to release it, like a man who'd learned his lesson about sharing. His birdie at the ninth provided a brief moment of genuine competence before triple-bogeys at the 12th and 13th reminded everyone that gravity remains undefeated.\n\nBut Alex BAKER's blow-up at the 13th offered Jon the opening. Alex took back the Trophy lead on that same hole with a four-point par, finally seizing the advantage he'd been circling for three rounds. It lasted precisely five holes. John PATTERSON posted the round's best Stableford (39 points) after opening the tournament with 26, which in psychological terms represents either growth or statistical randomness. Gregg WILLIAMS oscillated between blow-ups at the 2nd and 5th (both zero-pointers) and a back-nine 20-point rally that suggested someone had replaced his golf balls with regulation equipment.\n\nDavid MULLIN's 29-point Stableford round hid his gross-scoring excellence, the cruel maths already writing his Wooden Spoon destiny. Alex BAKER led by two points heading into the final round. Jon BAKER trailed for the first time all tournament. Drama beckoned.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> AB 110 | JB 108 | GW 104 | JP 99 | DM 94</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +51 | DM +54 | AB +72 | GW +72 | JP +96</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## ROUND 4: THE IMPLOSION PROTOCOLS {.round4 .round}\n\nBack at PGA Catalunya's Stadium Course for the finale, Alex BAKER arrived holding a two-point Trophy lead and the fragile psychology of a man who'd never won before. By the sixth hole, he'd blown up with a seven, scored zero points, and watched Jon BAKER reclaim the lead. He would not recover.\n\nWhat followed was less golf and more public disintegration. Five triple-bogeys across the round. Nine zero-point holes. A career-worst 27 points from 20 rounds of TEG data. The 9th, 12th, and 17th all delivered blow-ups (eights at par 4s and 5s), each one systematically dismantling his scorecard. This was not choking in the traditional sense. This was voluntary drowning in shallow water.\n\nJon BAKER posted 35 points, matching his Round 1 total, and sealed the double victory with the emotional affect of someone who'd simply forgotten to panic. His own blow-up at the 13th (an eight) briefly offered hope before everyone realised he was leading by enough to absorb tactical catastrophe. David MULLIN matched Jon's gross score with a +19 round, his best of the tournament, earning him exactly nothing but the Spoon and philosophical perspective on the difference between playing well and scoring well.\n\nJohn PATTERSON delivered the round's best Stableford (36 points) with three four-point holes, proving that talent exists mainly to make previous incompetence look intentional. Gregg WILLIAMS blow-up at the 10th (a nine) kept him honest. The final standings revealed Jon BAKER six points clear in the Trophy, three strokes ahead in the Jacket, and in possession of both titles without ever having been seriously threatened except by the ghost of Alex BAKER's self-belief.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 143 | AB 137 | GW 136 | JP 135 | DM 125</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +70 | DM +73 | GW +99 | AB +106 | JP +123</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nJon BAKER's wire-to-wire double sweep represented the triumph of not losing one's mind, which in amateur golf constitutes elite performance. He led for 59 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross scoring, establishing control in Round 1 and releasing it approximately never. Two birdies across four rounds. A course-equalling 84 in Round 2. The psychological fortitude to watch Alex BAKER's Round 4 meltdown and simply continue playing sensible golf. This is what dominance looks like when nobody's particularly dominant.\n\nAlex BAKER's collapse from Trophy leader to six-point runner-up via a 27-point final round will be studied by sports psychologists for decades, assuming sports psychologists care about amateur golf, which they don't. Five triple-bogeys, nine zero-point holes, a personal worst across 20 rounds of data. He led the Trophy for precisely 13 of 72 holes, all of them in Rounds 3 and 4, which suggests his timing needs recalibration. His tournament arc resembled a man building confidence specifically to ensure the fall hurt more.\n\nThe Wooden Spoon going to David MULLIN despite his second-place Jacket finish captured the essential cruelty of Stableford scoring: playing well in the wrong metric is just losing with better optics. Gregg WILLIAMS finished third in both competitions without ever leading either, a feat of competitive invisibility that deserves its own trophy. John PATTERSON's volatility (26 to 39 points across rounds) suggested someone was playing with randomised equipment.\n\nNo eagles across 72 holes. Six total birdies. Ninety-six rounds of golf, most of them conducted in a state of controlled panic. Jon BAKER won because everyone else either imploded or forgot to try. Catalonia had spoken. The message was clear: hope is a pre-existing condition, not a treatment plan.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\n**TEG Course Records:**\n- **PGA Catalunya - Tour Course:** Jon BAKER 84 (+12) - equalled in Round 2. Previously set in TEG 11, also matched by Gregg WILLIAMS, Jon BAKER, and David MULLIN in TEG 12.\n- **PGA Catalunya - Stadium Course:** Jon BAKER 89 - prior record from TEG 12, Round 4.\n\n**Personal Worsts:**\n- **Alex BAKER:** 27 points (Stableford) in Round 4 - career low across 20 TEG rounds played. Previous worst: substantially higher, presumably.\n\nThe course record at PGA Catalunya's Tour Course remains unbroken at 84, which in professional golf would be called \"deeply concerning\" but in TEG terms represents aspirational excellence. Alex BAKER's personal worst stands as the tournament's defining statistical monument, a 27-point final round that will live in infamy or at least in spreadsheets.\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n**Lead Tenure Analysis:**\n- Jon BAKER led the Trophy standings for 59 of 72 holes (82%), losing control only between H13 of Round 3 and H6 of Round 4 when Alex BAKER briefly remembered ambition.\n- Jon BAKER led the Jacket for 70 of 72 holes (97%), relinquishing control only at H3-4 of Round 3 to David MULLIN and H3-5 of Round 3 to various challengers, which in governance terms represents a landslide.\n- Alex BAKER led the Trophy for 13 holes total, all in the final 23 holes of the tournament, which suggests either late-stage confidence or catastrophically poor timing.\n\n**Front Nine vs Back Nine Divergence:**\n- John PATTERSON: 17 points (F9) vs 9 points (B9) in Round 1 (8-point differential), suggesting someone replaced his golf bag at the turn.\n- David MULLIN: 18 points (F9) vs 11 points (B9) in Round 3 (7-point differential), proof that starting strong guarantees precisely nothing.\n- Gregg WILLIAMS: 15 points (F9) vs 20 points (B9) in Round 3 (negative 5-point differential), a back-nine rally that kept him perpetually third.\n- Jon BAKER: 20 points (F9) vs 12 points (B9) in Round 3 (8-point differential), nearly squandering the lead before remembering he was Jon BAKER.\n\n**Blow-Up Distribution:**\n- John PATTERSON: 8 triple-bogeys in Round 1 alone, including six zero-point holes, which represents less golf and more performance art.\n- Alex BAKER: 5 triple-bogeys in Round 4, featuring 9 zero-point holes, the statistical signature of competitive self-harm.\n- Tournament-wide: Zero eagles. Six birdies. Approximately 47 triple-bogeys or worse, which in density terms qualifies as an epidemic.\n\n**Birdie Scarcity Index:**\n- Six birdies across 360 holes played (1.67% birdie rate), suggesting par is an aspirational concept rather than a baseline expectation.\n- Jon BAKER: 2 birdies. Gregg WILLIAMS: 2 birdies. David MULLIN: 2 birdies. Everyone else: busy trying not to make nines.\n\n**Gross Scoring Futility vs Stableford Success Paradox:**\n- David MULLIN finished 2nd in Jacket (+73 gross) but 5th in Trophy (125 points), earning the Spoon via the cruelest application of mathematics since calculus was invented.\n- This represents the TEG achievement gap: playing objectively better golf while scoring objectively fewer points, which is either profound irony or structural injustice depending on one's philosophical orientation.\n\n**Round Volatility Coefficient:**\n- John PATTERSON's 13-point range (26 to 39 points) across rounds suggests either personal growth or complete randomness.\n- Alex BAKER's 15-point range (27 to 42 points) captured the full human experience: competence, confidence, collapse.\n- Jon BAKER's 9-point range (32 to 41 points) represented the boring tyranny of consistency, which in competitive terms is unbeatable and in narrative terms is intolerable.\n\nThe data suggests that amateur golf remains a voluntary experiment in managing expectations downward while simultaneously believing, against all available evidence, that this time will be different. It won't be. It never is. That's why we play."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7564,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4527,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}

Four rounds across PGA Catalunya's Tour and Stadium courses produced 162 lead changes across the first ten holes of Round 3 alone, before John PATTERSON's metronomic consistency conquered the chaos. His victory margin of ten points represented the mathematical opposite of entertainment. Meanwhile, Jon BAKER led 58 of 72 holes in the Green Jacket race, which he won by eight strokes, whilst finishing fourth in Stableford. David MULLIN's tournament defied the laws of physics entirely: second in Gross scoring, dead last in points by four. The Wooden Spoon has never been awarded with such existential confusion.\n\nThe Stadium course, ranked fifth in Continental Europe by people who presumably measure such things, watched BAKER set a course record 89 in Round 4. PATTERSON's gross scores varied by just two strokes across four days, despite posting +96 overall. This was golf as bureaucratic procedure, victory through paperwork rather than pyrotechnics.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**John PATTERSON (Trophy Winner, 172pts, +96):** Led the tournament for 48 of 72 holes despite six Stableford zeros and a Round 1 opening that included a twelve at the 4th. His gross scores ranged from 23 to 25, suggesting a man who'd discovered the formula for controlled mediocrity. Survived catastrophic blow-ups at H4 R1, H15 R2, and H3 R3 to win by ten points. Standard deviation of 0.82 across rounds represents either remarkable consistency or a complete inability to improve.\n\n**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd, 162pts, +76):** Held both leads after Round 2, then authored golf's equivalent of a Victorian tragedy at H12-13 in Round 3. Ten strokes combined, zero points collected, hope extinguished. Led 33 holes total before the wheels came catastrophically off. His collapse made PATTERSON's victory possible whilst simultaneously creating a moral vacuum.\n\n**Stuart NEUMANN (3rd, 155pts, +108):** Matched PATTERSON's six Stableford zeros in what can only be described as competitive symmetry. His eagle at H15 R4 punctuated a back-nine surge that came far too late to matter. Front nine 17 points, back nine 23 in the final round. Mathematically impressive, strategically useless.\n\n**Jon BAKER (Green Jacket Winner, 145pts, +63):** Won wire-to-wire with an eight-stroke margin, leading 58 of 72 holes. Finished fourth in Stableford, which suggests the scoring systems are measuring entirely different sports. Set course record 89 at PGA Catalunya Stadium in Round 4. Collected four birdies across the tournament and zero eagles, proving dominance requires neither excitement nor drama.\n\n**Alex BAKER (5th, 143pts, +104):** Opened with a seven at the 1st and proceeded downward from there. Hit bottom at the 2nd hole of Round 1 with seven strokes, zero points, and presumably zero dignity remaining. Tied the final round lead with 40 points, which felt like apology rather than achievement.\n\n**David MULLIN (Wooden Spoon, 139pts, +71):** Won his third Spoon whilst posting the second-best Gross total, finishing 23 points behind fifth place in Stableford. His Round 4 featured six points across holes 2-7, then eleven points at holes 12-14, suggesting a man playing two separate tournaments simultaneously. Neither went well enough.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1: In Which Everything Begins Badly {.round1 .round}\n\nThe Tour course at PGA Catalunya received six players like a Victorian asylum receiving new patients. Hope met tee time. Both were equally delusional.\n\nJon BAKER opened with a seven at the 1st, collecting zero points whilst his brother Alex replicated the feat. Familial solidarity through incompetence. BAKER the elder seized the Trophy lead at the very same hole, which told you everything about the standards that would follow. By the 2nd, Alex had reached the bottom of the standings with another zero. He remained there, contemplating his life choices, whilst PATTERSON added a six at the Par 3 for three over.\n\nThen came the 4th hole, where PATTERSON authored a twelve. Not a typographical error. Twelve strokes, eight over par, zero points, and presumably a brief conversation with whatever gods oversee sporting humiliation. This was golfing graffiti on the scorecard, an act of competitive self-harm that should have ended his tournament before lunch.\n\nInstead, something remarkable occurred. PATTERSON collected four points at the 8th, four more at the 9th, then four at the 11th. Holes 8-13 yielded 22 points total. This represented either recovery or Stockholm Syndrome. BAKER (Jon) responded with birdies at the 3rd and 14th, taking the Jacket lead at the latter before Gregg WILLIAMS seized it at the 18th. Stuart NEUMANN, meanwhile, recorded blow-ups at the 5th, 13th, and 15th. The 15th produced a twelve to match PATTERSON's earlier masterpiece. Symmetry in suffering.\n\nWILLIAMS posted 46 points to lead by one over PATTERSON. J. BAKER matched Williams at +12 Gross to share that lead. Everyone else contemplated whether golf was actually fun or simply theatrical masochism.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> GW 46 | JP 45 | JB 40 | SN 36 | DM 35 | AB 34</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +12 | JB +12 | DM +17 | JP +24 | AB +30 | SN +33</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: The Illusion of Control {.round2 .round}\n\nBack on the Tour course, WILLIAMS maintained both leads with the calm of a man who didn't yet know what awaited. PATTERSON took the Trophy lead at the 4th after Williams recorded an eight for zero points. Order appeared restored. It wasn't.\n\nStuart NEUMANN collected a birdie at the 6th, adding four points, as part of a stretch where holes 4-9 yielded 19 points. This represented peak NEUMANN. Holes 8-13 produced another 19. Then normality resumed and he finished with 44 points, highest of the round but third overall. Mathematical glory, positional irrelevance.\n\nWILLIAMS regained the Jacket lead at the 10th with a birdie. Alex BAKER matched it. The leaderboard churned like bureaucratic machinery processing failure. PATTERSON reached the 15th and authored a catastrophic ten for zero points, surrendering the Trophy lead he'd held since the 4th. This was the tournament's first genuine turning point, though nobody recognized it at the time.\n\nDavid MULLIN posted 40 points and +12 Gross, matching J. BAKER's opening round. This represented peak MULLIN. The rest of his tournament would be descent disguised as participation. Jon BAKER collected 36 points whilst maintaining the Jacket lead at +16 overall. His brother Alex managed 37 points despite blow-ups at the 7th and 9th, proof that the scoring system rewards survival as much as excellence.\n\nWILLIAMS held both leads. PATTERSON trailed by one point. The tournament balanced on a knife edge constructed entirely of incompetence.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> GW 88 | JP 87 | SN 80 | JB 76 | DM 75 | AB 71</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +28 | JB +28 | DM +29 | JP +48 | SN +54 | AB +54</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: The Great Unraveling {.round3 .round}\n\nThe Stadium course, ranked amongst Continental Europe's elite, witnessed administrative chaos masquerading as competition. PATTERSON took the Trophy lead at the 1st. WILLIAMS reclaimed it at the 2nd whilst seizing the Jacket lead. Both Bakers recorded blow-ups. MULLIN joined them. NEUMANN contributed a seven. The 2nd hole was carnage.\n\nThe 3rd hole saw J. BAKER lose the Jacket lead whilst PATTERSON recorded a ten for zero points, surrendering the Trophy lead. WILLIAMS now held both. The 4th hole arrived like divine retribution. Williams posted a catastrophic nine for zero points, losing both leads simultaneously. BAKER (Jon) took the Jacket. PATTERSON seized the Trophy. Four holes played, sixteen lead changes recorded. This was golf as parliamentary procedure, every decision immediately reversed.\n\nPATTERSON survived a blow-up at the 7th. By the 9th, WILLIAMS had regained the Trophy lead. By the 10th, he'd lost it again. The leaderboard resembled a stock market in free fall. Then came holes 12 and 13, where Williams recorded an eight and an eleven. Ten strokes combined, zero points collected, tournament hopes extinguished. This was the death of hope filmed in real time.\n\nJ. BAKER collected a birdie at the 12th. PATTERSON responded with another at the 15th as part of a holes 12-17 stretch yielding 19 points. He emerged with the Trophy lead by eight points. WILLIAMS had fallen to second. The chaos had selected its victor through process of elimination.\n\nBAKER led the Jacket by six strokes. MULLIN languished in sixth in Stableford despite sitting second in Gross. The scoring systems had achieved complete philosophical divergence.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JP 132 | GW 124 | SN 115 | JB 110 | AB 103 | DM 105</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +46 | DM +51 | GW +56 | JP +71 | AB +83 | SN +84</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: Consolidation and Course Records {.round4 .round}\n\nBack at the Stadium, PATTERSON opened with a seven for one point. This was metronomic consistency meeting reality. He collected four points at the 2nd and 5th, then a seven again at the 9th. Final tally: 40 points, extending his lead to ten. Victory achieved through paperwork.\n\nJ. BAKER posted 35 points and +17 Gross, setting the course record at 89. This represented peak BAKER, occurring after the tournament had been decided. He secured the Green Jacket by eight strokes whilst finishing fourth in Stableford. The systems had measured different sports and reached opposite conclusions.\n\nNEUMANN recorded the tournament's only eagle at the 15th, part of a back-nine surge producing 23 points. Too late. Too little. Too mathematically elegant to matter. His front nine yielded seventeen points. The timing remained criminally wrong. Alex BAKER matched PATTERSON's 40 points to tie the round lead, which felt like participation trophy rather than achievement.\n\nMULLIN authored a Round 4 that defied description. Six points across holes 2-7, including blow-ups at the 3rd and 4th. Then birdies at the 12th and 14th for eleven points across three holes. He finished with 34 points and +20 Gross, securing the Wooden Spoon whilst posting the second-best Gross total. This was golf as philosophical paradox, achievement and failure occupying the same scorecard simultaneously.\n\nPATTERSON cruised home. WILLIAMS posted 38 points for second. NEUMANN and A. BAKER tied the round lead at 40 points each. Nobody cared. The tournament had ended at WILLIAMS's catastrophic 12th-13th in Round 3. What followed was simply documentation.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JP 172 | GW 162 | SN 155 | JB 145 | AB 143 | DM 139</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +63 | DM +71 | GW +76 | JP +96 | AB +104 | SN +108</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nJohn PATTERSON claimed his second Trophy through the sort of metronomic consistency that makes excellent bureaucracy but terrible television. Gross scores of 96-96-95-97 represented either remarkable steadiness or complete inability to improve. His standard deviation of 0.82 across rounds was matched only by his six Stableford zeros. He led the tournament for 48 of 72 holes despite catastrophic blow-ups at H4 R1, H15 R2, and H3 R3. This was victory through survival, not excellence.\n\nJon BAKER secured his second Green Jacket wire-to-wire, leading 58 of 72 holes. His eight-stroke margin represented dominance. His fourth-place Stableford finish represented philosophical confusion about what golf actually measures. He set the Stadium course record at 89 in Round 4, proof that excellence arrived fashionably late.\n\nThe tournament turned at holes 12-13 of Round 3, where Gregg WILLIAMS recorded ten strokes for zero points. This was golf as Greek tragedy, assuming the Greeks measured suffering in Stableford. Williams had held both leads after Round 2. By the 13th hole of Round 3, he'd lost both permanently. The tournament selected its victor through WILLIAMS's elimination rather than PATTERSON's coronation.\n\nDavid MULLIN collected his third Wooden Spoon whilst posting the second-best Gross score, finishing 23 points behind fifth place in Stableford. This defied every known law of competitive logic. His Round 4 roller coaster (six points holes 2-7, then eleven points 12-14) summarized a tournament where achievement and disaster occupied the same scorecard. Stuart NEUMANN's eagle at H15 R4 punctuated a back-nine surge that came exactly one round too late. Alex BAKER tied the final round lead after spending most of the tournament contemplating existential questions at the bottom of the leaderboard.\n\nWhat remained was 172 points for PATTERSON, a ten-point margin, and the knowledge that golf tournaments are won not through brilliance but through making fewer catastrophic errors than the opposition. Metronomic consistency conquered chaos. The mathematics supported the result even if the narrative resisted.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\n**Personal Bests:**\n- Gregg WILLIAMS: 84 (Gross) at PGA Catalunya Tour, equaling Jon BAKER's previous best\n\n**Course Records:**\n- PGA Catalunya Stadium: Jon BAKER 89 (+17), Round 4\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n**Consistency Paradox:** PATTERSON's gross scores varied by just two strokes (95-97 range, StdDev 0.82) despite posting +96 total. Meanwhile, his Stableford performance ranged from 40-45 points (StdDev 2.45). The scoring systems measured entirely different competitions.\n\n**Lead Changes:** Sixteen lead changes occurred across holes 1-10 of Round 3. PATTERSON took the Trophy lead five times across the tournament. WILLIAMS held it after five different holes. The leaderboard churned like bureaucratic machinery until Williams's H12-13 collapse ended all uncertainty.\n\n**Stableford Zeros:** PATTERSON and NEUMANN each recorded six zeros. PATTERSON won the Trophy. NEUMANN finished third. Zero correlation detected between zeros and failure.\n\n**The MULLIN Paradox:** Second in Gross (+71), sixth in Stableford (139pts), 23 points behind fifth place. His Round 4 featured the tournament's greatest intra-round variance: 0.86 points per hole across H2-7, then 3.67 points per hole across H12-14.\n\n**Front Nine vs Back Nine:** Only two players showed significant splits. Alex BAKER: F9 14pts, B9 23pts in Round 2. David MULLIN: F9 13pts, B9 21pts in Round 4. Both came far too late to matter. NEUMANN's final round split (F9 17pts, B9 23pts) represented peak timing failure.\n\n**Wire-to-Wire Watch:** J. BAKER led the Green Jacket race for 58 of 72 holes (80.6%). His final margin was eight strokes. This represented dominance disguised as inevitability.\n\n**Blow-up Equality:** Every player recorded at least two blow-ups. WILLIAMS's H12-13 R3 sequence (+10 combined) represented peak carnage. PATTERSON's H4 R1 twelve matched NEUMANN's H15 R1 twelve for shared ignominy. Golf distributed suffering with bureaucratic fairness."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8210,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4139,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}

Others reveal themselves as prolonged, inevitable mathematical exercises in humiliation. TEG 13 belonged firmly to the latter category. Jon Baker led every single hole of seventy-two, in both Stableford and Gross competitions simultaneously, a feat of such comprehensive dominance that one suspects the other four participants might have been better served staying in bed. He won by six points and eighteen strokes respectively. The venues were spectacular: Royal Cinque Ports, Prince's, and Littlestone, three Kent links courses where the wind performs acts of casual violence upon golf balls.\n\nThe supporting cast provided their own tragicomic subplots. Gregg Williams mounted a spirited pursuit that peaked at precisely one hole of shared leadership before reality reasserted itself. John Patterson produced the tournament's most volatility, featuring an eagle immediately followed by a blow-up, a forty-nine-point round immediately preceded by a twenty-eight-point round, and finishing joint third despite playing like a man whose internal GPS had been systematically corrupted. Most poignantly, David Mullin descended from eight-time Green Jacket champion to Wooden Spoon recipient, sealed by a ninth-hole disaster that read like a ransom note written by someone who'd lost count.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**Jon BAKER (Winner, Trophy & Jacket):** Swept both competitions with the emotional range of a metronome, never once relinquishing either lead. Led all seventy-two holes. His consistency bordered on the sociopathic: an eight-point round range across four days. Victory margins of six points and eighteen strokes respectively. This was dominance as administrative process.\n\n**Gregg WILLIAMS (2nd, Trophy & Jacket):** Briefly held the Trophy lead for exactly one hole in Round 2 before reality intervened. Finished eighteen strokes behind in the Jacket despite producing the tournament's best single round. One imagines him arriving home, partner asking how it went, Williams staring into the middle distance muttering \"I led for one hole.\"\n\n**Alex BAKER (Joint 3rd, Trophy):** Mounted no serious challenge whatsoever, yet somehow finished joint third through the simple expedient of not completely falling apart. His best round came on the final day when the tournament had already assumed room temperature. Produced his first-ever seventeen-gross hole, which in context felt like celebrating a parking ticket.\n\n**John PATTERSON (Joint 3rd, Trophy):** The tournament's designated chaos agent. Recorded both an eagle and three blow-ups in Round 4 alone. His twenty-one-point round swing and fourteen total blow-ups suggested a man playing golf whilst simultaneously receiving troubling news via earpiece. Finished joint third despite gross scores that occasionally resembled telephone numbers.\n\n**David MULLIN (Wooden Spoon):** Eight-time Green Jacket winner reduced to Spoon recipient via a ninth-hole disaster in Round 4 that will haunt Kent for generations. The H10 scorecard entry read nine-slash-plus-five. That's not golf. That's a cry for help written in numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1: The Immediate Establishment of Hierarchy {.round1 .round}\n\nRoyal Cinque Ports revealed itself as advertised: a championship links that hosted two Open Championships and possessed the moral flexibility to destroy amateur golfers without remorse. The first hole saw Baker and Williams share both Trophy and Jacket leads at three points and level par respectively, a brief moment of democratic equality that lasted approximately four hundred yards. Links golf operates on principles of Old Testament justice.\n\nBy the third hole, Jon Baker had birdied whilst Williams recorded his second consecutive blow-up. The separation was complete. Baker's front nine produced twenty-three Stableford points, establishing a comfortable six-point Trophy lead and nine-stroke Jacket advantage. Williams attempted recovery on the back nine with twenty-one points including a birdie at the fifteenth, but the mathematics had already assumed their final shape. Patterson experienced a round that foreshadowed his tournament: three blow-ups scattered across eighteen holes like landmines deployed by a confused general.\n\nAlex Baker endured consecutive blow-ups at eleven and twelve, the golfing equivalent of walking into the same glass door twice. Mullin played steadily for third place. The tone was set.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 39 | GW 33 | DM 31 | AB 31 | JP 28</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +13 | GW +22 | DM +22 | AB +30 | JP +36</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: The Five-Minute Revolution {.round2 .round}\n\nPrince's Dunes-Himalayas combination offered twenty-seven holes of authentic links torment distributed across three spectacular nines. The wind arrived like an unwelcome relative. Patterson opened with consecutive blow-ups, establishing early that today's performance would match yesterday's in terms of structural integrity. Williams produced the tournament's best round: forty-one points of relentless Stableford accumulation. By the fifteenth hole, he'd actually seized the Trophy lead. Democracy briefly flickered.\n\nJon Baker responded with the emotional affect of a man discovering his parking meter had expired. He birdied the eighteenth, reclaimed the lead, and proceeded as if the entire democratic experiment had been a minor administrative error requiring correction. His thirty-six points maintained a one-point Trophy advantage. The Jacket lead remained untouchable at sixteen gross. Williams had played brilliantly and gained precisely nothing in the Gross competition. The cruelty was elegant.\n\nPatterson recorded six blow-ups and finished with twenty-eight points, a score suggesting either deliberate sabotage or complete cognitive meltdown. Alex Baker's thirty-four points kept him mathematically relevant whilst spiritually defeated. Mullin quietly accumulated thirty-seven points. The gap to Baker's lead had widened to one point in Trophy, comfortable distance in Jacket.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 75 | GW 74 | DM 68 | AB 65 | JP 56</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +29 | GW +36 | DM +39 | AB +57 | JP +69</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: The Great Volatility Experiment {.round3 .round}\n\nLittlestone, a classic remote links on Romney Marshes designed by Royal St George's architect and refined by Braid and MacKenzie, provided the theater for Patterson's cognitive resurrection. He produced forty-nine Stableford points, rocketing from fifth to joint third in Trophy standings via a performance that included a birdie, multiple four-point holes, and mercifully few acts of self-harm. One imagines his playing partners experiencing whiplash.\n\nBaker responded with forty-four points and a birdie at the ninth, extending his Trophy lead to five points whilst maintaining complete Jacket control. Williams managed forty points but lost ground in both competitions despite playing objectively good golf. This is the essential tragedy of amateur tournament golf: you can improve dramatically and still lose comprehensively. Alex Baker and Mullin both recorded thirty-two points, sufficient to remain upright but insufficient to challenge.\n\nThe standings after fifty-four holes told a story of mathematical inevitability interrupted briefly by Patterson's manic episode. Baker led by five in Trophy, nineteen in Jacket. Williams trailed in both. Patterson had clawed back to joint third through sheer volatility. Mullin occupied fourth, unaware that his final round contained a ninth-hole disaster that would define his tournament legacy.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 119 | GW 114 | JP 105 | AB 97 | DM 100</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +37 | GW +51 | JP +81 | AB +86 | DM +60</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: The Sealing of Fates {.round4 .round}\n\nPrince's Shore-Dunes combination, considered the strongest routing available, witnessed the tournament's conclusion and Mullin's descent into Spoon ignominy. Patterson opened with an eagle at the second hole, a magnificent piece of golf that lasted approximately four minutes before he recorded a blow-up at the third. This summarised his entire tournament: moments of genuine brilliance immediately followed by complete unraveling. He'd finish with thirty-six points and three blow-ups, bipolar excellence incarnate.\n\nThe tenth hole destroyed David Mullin utterly. A nine. Plus five. Zero points. The Wooden Spoon was his, sealed by a single hole of such comprehensive failure that one suspects the course itself felt embarrassed. Eight-time Green Jacket champion reduced to final-place finisher via eighteen holes of accumulating horror. Alex Baker, sensing opportunity, recorded four points at the same hole to escape Spoon territory. Professional survival instincts.\n\nJon Baker closed with thirty-nine points including a birdie at the seventeenth, maintaining both leads comfortably. His gross score set a new course record at Prince's Shore-Dunes. Gregg Williams finished second in both competitions despite producing thirty-eight points. The margins were decisive: six points Trophy, eighteen strokes Jacket. Baker had led all seventy-two holes. Never trailed. Never faltered.\n\nThe final scorecards revealed a tournament of stark contrasts: Baker's metronomic consistency versus Patterson's twenty-one-point round swings, Williams's relentless pursuit meeting immovable dominance, Mullin's fall from champion to Spoon. Some contests are decided by skill. Some by consistency. This one was decided on the first hole and simply took seventy-one more to formalise the paperwork.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> JB 158 | GW 152 | AB 141 | JP 141 | DM 135</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> JB +50 | GW +68 | AB +103 | JP +106 | DM +80</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nTEG 13 will be remembered not for competitive drama but for administrative thoroughness. Jon Baker led every single hole across seventy-two, in both competitions simultaneously, a statistical anomaly suggesting either supreme skill or deeply flawed tournament design. His third Trophy and third Green Jacket arrived via margins that rendered the final two rounds essentially ceremonial. Six-point Trophy victory. Eighteen-stroke Jacket win. Complete control from first tee to eighteenth green.\n\nThe supporting narratives provided their own savage entertainment. Williams mounted what technically qualified as a challenge, briefly seizing the Trophy lead for one glorious hole before mathematics reasserted hierarchy. He finished second in both competitions having played genuinely excellent golf that simply encountered an immovable object. Patterson's volatility produced the tournament's most memorable statistical spread: a forty-nine-point round, an eagle-to-blow-up combo in consecutive holes, fourteen total blow-ups, and a twenty-one-point round range that suggested someone playing three different sports simultaneously. He finished joint third despite gross scores occasionally entering telephone-number territory.\n\nMost poignantly, David Mullin's tournament arc traced a hero's journey in reverse. Eight-time Green Jacket champion arriving in Kent with legitimate credentials, departing with the Wooden Spoon after a tenth-hole disaster that will echo through amateur golf folklore. The scorecard entry read nine-slash-plus-five. That's not golf. That's numerical violence. Alex Baker survived to joint third through the simple expedient of not completely imploding, his best round arriving when the tournament had already flatlined.\n\nThe Kent links provided spectacular theatre for this exercise in competitive futility. Royal Cinque Ports, Prince's dual configurations, and Littlestone offered proper championship tests that exposed every technical flaw and psychological weakness. The courses were magnificent. The golf ranged from dominant to catastrophic. Some tournaments produce thrilling narratives of comeback and drama. Others reveal themselves as prolonged demonstrations of mathematical inevitability punctuated by isolated moments of chaos. TEG 13 belonged firmly to the latter category, and we're arguably richer for having witnessed it.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\n**Personal Bests:**\n- Jon BAKER: 8.0 (Gross, Round 3) – 1 of 46 rounds in TEG history\n- Alex BAKER: 17.0 (Gross, Round 4) – 1 of 28 rounds in TEG history\n- John PATTERSON: 12.0 (Gross, Round 3) – 1 of 19 rounds in TEG history\n- John PATTERSON: 49.0 (Stableford, Round 3) – 1 of 19 rounds in TEG history\n\n**Course Records:**\n- Prince's Shore-Dunes: Jon BAKER set new record of 85 gross (previous 88, also Baker, TEG 14)\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n**Consistency Analysis:**\nJon Baker's dominance derived partly from supernatural consistency: standard deviation of 3.32 in gross scores, producing an eight-point Stableford range across four rounds. Meanwhile, Patterson's 10.72 gross standard deviation suggested someone playing entirely different sports on alternate days. The contrast between metronomic excellence and beautiful chaos defined the tournament's character.\n\n**The Blow-up Paradox:**\nPatterson accumulated fourteen blow-ups across seventy-two holes yet finished joint third in Trophy standings, proof that occasional excellence can overcome systematic disaster. Baker recorded six blow-ups but maintained leads throughout. Williams suffered six blow-ups and finished second in both competitions. The moral: consistency in mediocrity defeats volatility in almost-competence.\n\n**The Fifty-Six-Stroke Chasm:**\nFinal gross scores ranged from Baker's plus-fifty to Patterson's plus-one-hundred-six, a fifty-six-stroke spread suggesting five entirely different tournaments occurred simultaneously. This wasn't competition. This was five parallel universes occasionally intersecting at tee boxes and greens.\n\n**The One-Hole Democracy:**\nWilliams held the Trophy lead for exactly one hole across seventy-two. Democracy lasted approximately fifteen minutes before autocracy reasserted itself. One imagines historians studying this brief flickering of hope before inevitable extinguishment.\n\n**The Mullin Tragedy:**\nAn eight-time Green Jacket champion claiming the Wooden Spoon represents either profound regression or statistical inevitability finally asserting itself. His H10 disaster in Round 4 sealed the fate: nine strokes, plus-five, zero points. That's not golf. That's a crime scene requiring investigation."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6421,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3537,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}

This is amateur golf distilled to its essence: a man spending four days constructing an elaborate defensive structure only to watch it catch fire in the final hour while he fumbles for a bucket. His third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket arrived via the tournament's narrowest margin, a two-point survival act over Alex Baker whose volcanic final round of forty-three points might be the most spectacular failure in TEG history. Jon Baker simultaneously finished second in gross and dead last in Stableford, a feat requiring such precise incompetence it borders on performance art.\n\nKent bore witness to this three-day collapse filmed at half speed. Four rounds across Royal Cinque Ports, Littlestone, and Prince's tested championship resolve. All four players recorded catastrophic blow-ups exceeding ten shots. Every participant hit double-digit carnage at some point. Mullin's wire-to-wire dominance became a masterclass in nervous preservation. Victory margins shrank like ice cream in sunshine.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**David MULLIN (Trophy Winner, Green Jacket Winner):** Led from the first hole, which sounds triumphant until you realise it meant seventy-two holes of watching your lead evaporate like confidence. His 154 points and plus-sixty-eight gross represented steadiness in a field defined by volcanic instability. Four birdies, six zero-point holes, and the standard deviations of a man clinging to sanity by his fingernails. When his closest rival mounted a final-round charge capable of overtaking him, Mullin responded with thirty-seven points, which is the golfing equivalent of defending your home with a rolled-up newspaper.\n\n**Alex BAKER (Trophy Runner-up):** Closed a nine-point gap to two with the tournament's best round, forty-three points of pure rage against mathematics. Finished second by margins requiring microscopes. Zero birdies across four rounds, which makes his near-victory even more absurd. Nine zero-point holes including a catastrophic ten on the sixteenth in Round Four, moments after threatening genuine contention. His scorecard reads like someone fighting their way out of quicksand by climbing on their own shoulders.\n\n**Gregg WILLIAMS (Trophy 3rd, Green Jacket 3rd):** Posted the tournament's best Stableford round, thirty-nine points in Round Three, which moved him precisely nowhere. Finished seventeen points behind in Trophy, eight behind in Jacket. Zero birdies. Seven zero-point holes. His front-nine-to-back-nine differentials suggest a man who takes six holes to remember how golf works.\n\n**Jon BAKER (Trophy Spoon, Green Jacket Runner-up):** Five birdies, most in the field. Runner-up in gross by seven shots. Wooden Spoon in Stableford with 125 points. This man exists in quantum superposition, simultaneously excellent and catastrophic. Eleven zero-point holes. Eight on three separate occasions. His scorecards need trigger warnings.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1: Hope Meeting Royal Cinque Ports {.round1 .round}\n\nRoyal Cinque Ports hosted the opening act, a championship links with a reputation for consuming hubris. The wind came off the Channel like an audit. Four men teed off believing in their preparations. By the third hole, three of them knew better.\n\nMullin and Alex Baker shared the early lead through one hole, a moment of optimism that lasted approximately eight minutes. The third hole, a par five, became a theatre of operations. Gregg Williams posted nine. Jon Baker managed eight. These numbers require context: par was five. Both men recorded zeros in Stableford, which is golf's way of saying \"we'll pretend that didn't happen except we're writing it down.\"\n\nJon Baker doubled down on the fifth with another eight. Two holes, two catastrophes, a front nine that read like accident reports. Ten points across six holes. Meanwhile, Mullin suffered his own seven on the seventh, losing the Jacket lead. He responded like a man who'd actually read the assignment, birdieing the tenth to reclaim first place. Alex Baker, in contrast, posted ten on the sixteenth, a score requiring sustained commitment to disaster. Then a seven on the eighteenth, because why not.\n\nMullin closed with forty points and a five-shot gross lead. Alex Baker held second on thirty-seven points despite three blow-ups. Jon Baker's twenty-nine points earned last place. The margins established themselves early. Gregg Williams occupied third, plotting his eventual escape from irrelevance.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> DM 40 | AB 37 | GW 33 | JB 29</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +15 | JB +20 | GW +21 | AB +26</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: Littlestone and the Art of Extending Leads {.round2 .round}\n\nLittlestone-on-Sea sits on the Romney Marshes like a challenge written in grass. Purves designed it, Braid and MacKenzie refined it. Championship pedigree. The field approached it like men approaching a particularly aggressive dentist.\n\nMullin posted forty-one points, including birdies on the seventh and eighteenth. Eight pars or better. One zero-point hole, the fourth, where his seven felt almost apologetic. He extended his Trophy lead to nine points, his Jacket advantage to three shots. These numbers matter because they represent breathing room. Or what passes for breathing room in amateur golf.\n\nAlex Baker recorded five blow-ups. Five. Two zero-point holes. His thirty-five points kept him second but the gap yawned. Jon Baker managed twenty-nine points again, which demonstrates impressive consistency in mediocrity. Gregg Williams posted twenty-seven with four zero-point holes, a round requiring sustained commitment to damage limitation.\n\nThe standings crystallised. Mullin led both competitions. Alex Baker sat second in Trophy, fourth in Jacket. The stage was set. Nobody bothered checking if the stage was structurally sound.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> DM 81 | AB 72 | GW 60 | JB 58</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +29 | JB +41 | GW +47 | AB +55</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: Prince's and the Beginning of Unraveling {.round3 .round}\n\nPrince's Shore-Dunes combination represents the club's strongest routing. The field approached it like men who'd forgotten their previous two rounds. Mullin immediately posted eight on the second, zero points, his lead suddenly flammable. Then a seven on the seventh. Then nine on the eighth, zero points, the mathematical equivalent of self-harm.\n\nJon Baker birdied the second, moments after Mullin's collapse. Then posted seven on the fourth, seven on the sixth, five on the eleventh, eight on the thirteenth, six on the seventeenth. His round contained a birdie and five blow-ups, which is like building a house and setting five rooms on fire. Twenty-eight points. But his gross score held steady, maintaining Jacket contention through pure spite.\n\nGregg Williams posted the day's best Stableford round, thirty-nine points. His gross of plus-fourteen closed the Jacket gap from eighteen shots to twelve. In normal circumstances, this represents a charge. In TEG terms, it's a gentle jog towards relevance.\n\nMullin's thirty-six points kept him eight clear in Trophy despite his struggles. Alex Baker's thirty-seven points moved him into second place. The final round awaited. Leads could be defended or surrendered. Probably both simultaneously.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> DM 117 | AB 109 | GW 99 | JB 86</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +49 | GW +61 | JB +64 | AB +80</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: The Two-Point Survival {.round4 .round}\n\nPrince's again. Familiarity breeds not contempt but catastrophe. Alex Baker opened with four points on the first. Four on the seventh. Four on the thirteenth. Four on the fourteenth. Between these moments of brilliance, he posted seven on the tenth, eight on the twelfth. Then the sixteenth arrived.\n\nTen shots. Plus-six. Zero points. The most spectacular self-administered wound in tournament history, coming precisely when victory seemed mathematically viable. His forty-three points still represented the tournament's best round. He closed the gap from nine to two. It wasn't enough.\n\nJon Baker posted four birdies, the second, sixth, twelfth, and thirteenth. His gross of plus-eleven secured Jacket runner-up by seven shots. His Stableford total of 125 points earned the Wooden Spoon. He also posted eight on the eighteenth, because consistency matters. This man contains multitudes, all of them contradictory.\n\nMullin needed only thirty-seven points. He delivered precisely that, including an eight on the tenth that briefly made coronary arrests a possibility. His lead shrank to two points. Wire-to-wire victory, maintained by the width of a putting stroke.\n\nGregg Williams finished seventeen points back in Trophy, eight behind in Jacket. He posted thirty-eight points, which in any other tournament might matter.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> DM 154 | AB 152 | GW 137 | JB 125</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> DM +68 | JB +75 | GW +76 | AB +102</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nDavid Mullin defended his leads across seventy-two holes and arrived at victory gasping like a man who'd run a marathon in dress shoes. His third Trophy and ninth Green Jacket represent cumulative excellence rather than dominant performance. He led wire-to-wire, which sounds impressive until you realise he nearly surrendered everything in the final nine holes. Two-point margins don't inspire confidence. They inspire therapy.\n\nAlex Baker's forty-three-point final round represented the tournament's single best performance and its most spectacular failure. His catastrophic ten on the sixteenth, coming moments after genuine contention, might be the most perfectly timed disaster in TEG history. Zero birdies across four rounds. Nine zero-point holes. Still nearly won. This is golf as Greek tragedy, assuming the Greeks played off twenty-four handicaps.\n\nJon Baker finished second in gross, last in Stableford. Five birdies, most in the field. Wooden Spoon recipient. He exists in permanent contradiction, simultaneously brilliant and catastrophic. His scorecards require philosophical analysis.\n\nTEG 14 belonged to no one and everyone. All four players posted double-digit blow-ups. Every participant suffered complete unravelings. The margins between victory and defeat shrank to two points in Trophy, seven shots in Jacket. Kent's championship links witnessed golf at its most beautifully futile. Mullin survived. Baker charged. Williams closed. Jon Baker birdied his way to last place. Nobody claimed dominance. Several claimed survival.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\n- **Jon BAKER:** Course Record (Prince's - Shore/Dunes): 83 gross, Round 4, TEG 14\n\nNo new TEG records were set during this tournament.\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n**Catastrophic Blow-ups (10+ shots)**\nAll four players recorded double-digit disasters, confirming TEG 14's status as a masterclass in voluntary suffering:\n- Alex BAKER: 10 on H16 R4 (catastrophic +6)\n- Gregg WILLIAMS: 9 on H3 R1 (blow-up +4)\n- Jon BAKER: 8 on three separate occasions (H3 R1, H5 R1, H18 R4)\n- David MULLIN: 9 on H8 R3 (blow-up +4)\n\n**Zero-Point Hole Accumulation**\n- Jon BAKER: 11 zero-point holes (led field in mathematical erasure)\n- Alex BAKER: 9 zero-point holes\n- Gregg WILLIAMS: 7 zero-point holes\n- David MULLIN: 6 zero-point holes (fewest, yet still six acts of scorecard violence)\n\n**The Birdie Paradox**\n- Jon BAKER: 5 birdies, Wooden Spoon (125 pts)\n- David MULLIN: 4 birdies, Trophy and Jacket winner (154 pts)\n- Alex BAKER: 0 birdies, Trophy runner-up (152 pts)\n- Gregg WILLIAMS: 0 birdies, Trophy 3rd (137 pts)\n\nThis statistical reality confirms that excellence and disaster coexist in perfect harmony, that birdies guarantee nothing, and that consistency in mediocrity defeats brilliance punctuated by catastrophe. Jon Baker's five birdies earned him last place. David Mullin's four won both titles. Golf remains fundamentally absurd.\n\n**Trophy Margin Analysis**\nThe two-point final margin represents the tightest finish in TEG 14 history despite zero lead changes after Round One. Mullin led for seventy-two consecutive holes yet arrived at victory like a man fleeing a burning building. Alex Baker closed from nine points back with a forty-three-point eruption and still finished second. Twenty-nine points separated second from fourth place (Baker 152, Williams 137, Jon Baker 125), confirming that the field existed in three distinct categories: survived, nearly survived, and Jon."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5928,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3361,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}

This one unfolded as a four-round PowerPoint presentation titled \"Gregg Williams Is Rather Good At Golf And You Lot Demonstrably Are Not.\" Williams seized both leads by hole four of round one and spent the subsequent seventy-one holes extending his advantage with the grim inevitability of entropy. By the final green, he'd accumulated his fourth Trophy and maiden Green Jacket with a twenty-one-point margin that suggested less a competition than a sponsored charity event where the sponsor forgot to turn up.\n\nThe tournament's secondary plot concerned who would finish least catastrophically behind him. Stuart Neumann surged to second place despite recording a quintuple bogey on the final hole, which tells you everything about the carnage unfolding in Williams's wake. Hole eighteen produced five disasters from six players, as if the golf gods had decided to stage a commemorative fireworks display to mark the end of amateur ambition. The field collectively recorded sixty-one blow-ups across four rounds. Williams had eight.\n\nThe venue was Portugal's Lisbon Coast, returning after a six-tournament absence. Four courses. Three new to TEG's records. Conditions varied from Estoril's tree-lined parkland charm to Oitavos Dunes's wind-battered Atlantic exposure, which by Sunday resembled less a golf course than a psychological endurance test conducted by sadists with clipboards.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**Gregg Williams (Winner, Both Competitions):** Led all seventy-two holes of Trophy competition and sixty-four of seventy-two in Green Jacket reckoning. Five birdies. Twenty-eight pars. Eight disasters spread across four rounds like tasteful seasoning. Completed the career sweep with his first Jacket to accompany three previous Trophies. Played golf as if following instructions from a manual titled \"How Not To Be Terrible.\" The rest of us were clearly using different manuals, possibly written in languages we couldn't read.\n\n**Stuart Neumann (2nd Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Posted a brilliant forty-three points in round three, then celebrated by recording a nine on the final hole. Finished twenty-one points back despite this mathematical self-sabotage, which speaks either to his sustained excellence or everyone else's sustained mediocrity. Recorded no birdies across seventy-two holes, suggesting a philosophical commitment to par that bordered on religious devotion. His round-four front nine tallied twenty-one points before the back nine reminded him that hope is a cognitive error.\n\n**John Patterson (3rd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Briefly held the Trophy lead at round two's third hole before collapsing like a man who'd just remembered he'd left the oven on at home. Bookended the tournament with disasters: an eight on round one's first hole, a ten on round four's opener. Between these literary brackets, occasionally played decent golf. Finished third despite gross scores that suggested someone filling in a tax return while drunk.\n\n**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Led both competitions after hole one, then recorded six blow-ups in seven holes spanning round one's eleventh through seventeenth. This constitutes what psychologists call \"a complete cognitive unraveling.\" Finished second in Green Jacket standings despite thirteen zero-point holes, which is rather like winning the bronze medal in a race where you spent most of the time running the wrong direction. His round two featured a seventeen that appeared on the scorecard like a ransom demand.\n\n**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Struck an eagle on round two's fifteenth, which was lovely. Also recorded twelve disasters, which was less lovely. His round four featured blow-ups on both the first hole and the eighteenth, bracketing the round like satirical punctuation marks. Posted a personal-worst thirty-three over par on the final day, suggesting he'd achieved some form of anti-enlightenment where understanding golf made him worse at it.\n\n**Alex Baker (6th, Both Competitions, Spoon):** Thirteen zero-point holes. Plus one hundred and thirty-four gross. A third career Wooden Spoon, which at least demonstrates consistency in an otherwise chaotic universe. Recorded a ten on round three's fourteenth hole that appeared to break something fundamental in his relationship with the sport. Occasionally struck decent shots, presumably by accident. Avoided being mentioned in any hot-spell statistics, which is perhaps the kindest thing one can say.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1: The Theatre Of Operations Commences {.round1 .round}\n\nEstoril Golf Club presented itself as a charming parkland examination, the sort of course where accuracy matters more than distance and course management matters more than both. By the third hole, it had become a clinical study in who could manage not to hit eight. The answer, it turned out, was mostly Gregg Williams.\n\nJon Baker opened with a four on the first to claim both leads simultaneously, which must have felt rather nice for approximately twelve minutes. Williams responded to his own opening-hole eight with a birdie on the third and another on the fourth, seizing both leads by the time most players were still processing their opening disasters. Stuart Neumann recorded an eight and a nine on his first three holes, suggesting he'd arrived at the course under the impression it was crazy golf.\n\nBaker's front nine promised much. Twenty-one points. Then came holes ten through seventeen, which resembled less a stretch of golf than a humanitarian crisis conducted in slow motion. Six blow-ups in seven holes. Nines on the eleventh and twelfth. Another seven. Another eight. By the seventeenth, his scorecard read like a failed attempt at sudoku. Williams, meanwhile, cruised to thirty-nine points with the serene confidence of a man who'd discovered the secret to golf was simply not being catastrophically bad at it.\n\nPatterson rallied on the back nine to claim second place, eleven points adrift. Baker finished third despite his collapse, which tells you everything about everyone else's front nine. Williams led by five points and eight strokes. The mathematical inevitability had begun.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> GW 39 | JP 34 | JB 31 | SN 31 | DM 30 | AB 30</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +17 | JB +27 | JP +27 | DM +25 | AB +30 | SN +37</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: The Widening Aperture {.round2 .round}\n\nWest Cliffs Golf Links arrived with its world-class credentials and immediately set about destroying any remaining illusions of competence. Cynthia Dye's links design earned World's Best New Course in 2017. By the sixth hole, most players wished it hadn't been invented at all.\n\nPatterson struck a birdie on the third to briefly claim the Trophy lead, which lasted precisely one hole. Williams reclaimed it on the fourth and spent the remainder of the round extending his advantage with the grim efficiency of a bailiff serving eviction notices. The sixth hole produced a massacre: four disasters, including an eleven from Alex Baker that suggested he'd stopped counting halfway through. Jon Baker added an eight and a nine on consecutive holes, which is commitment to a theme if nothing else.\n\nThe lowlight belonged to Baker's seventeenth hole seventeen, which appeared on the scorecard like a typographical error that turned out to be true. Williams, by contrast, recorded forty points despite a ten on the fifteenth that he probably found mildly irritating. Mullin struck an eagle on that same fifteenth. One point of light in a round that otherwise resembled a documentary about industrial decline.\n\nWilliams led by nine points after thirty-six holes. Patterson sat second, twenty-five strokes over par but somehow only nine points back in Trophy terms, which tells you something about the carnage. Baker and Alex Baker had recorded six zero-point holes each. The tournament had evolved from competition to survival exercise.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> GW 79 | JP 70 | JB 60 | AB 57 | SN 57 | DM 63</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +33 | JP +52 | DM +47 | JB +56 | AB +68 | SN +80</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: The Penha Longa Reckoning {.round3 .round}\n\nRobert Trent Jones Jr's Atlantic Course at Penha Longa occupies the Sintra hills like a mathematical proof that golf courses can be too beautiful to be fair. Mountain parkland terrain. Coastal views. Slopes that suggested the designer had confused \"challenging\" with \"vindictive.\" Williams posted forty-four points and plus ten gross, which on this layout constituted something approaching sorcery.\n\nHe struck birdies on the eighth, tenth, and fifteenth whilst everyone else struggled with basic arithmetic. Patterson managed twenty points on the front nine before recording disasters on the tenth and sixteenth that felt personally targeted by the golf gods. Alex Baker's fourteenth-hole ten arrived like the punchline to a joke nobody wanted to hear. Neumann posted forty-three points with zero birdies, which is rather like winning a baking competition without using flour.\n\nJon Baker recovered to forty-one points. Mullin notched forty despite his earlier struggles. The narrative was becoming less \"who can challenge Williams\" and more \"who can avoid finishing last.\" Williams's lead had stretched to eighteen points with one round remaining. Jacket standings showed similar dominance. The tournament had effectively ended. Sunday would merely provide the paperwork.\n\nPatterson's back nine yielded just fifteen points. Alex Baker recorded three disasters in six holes through the middle stretch. The course record fell to Williams. His plus ten remained tied for the course standard by round's end, which felt appropriate. He was, after all, running the entire show by this point.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> GW 123 | JP 105 | JB 101 | DM 103 | SN 100 | AB 86</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +43 | JB +69 | DM +72 | JP +77 | AB +102 | SN +100</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: The Final Green Apocalypse {.round4 .round}\n\nOitavos Dunes. Portugal's premier golf course. Top one hundred worldwide. The Atlantic coast at its most brutally honest. Sunday brought conditions that suggested the wind had developed personal grudges against specific players.\n\nPatterson opened with a ten. Mullin and Alex Baker struck eights. By the time most players reached the second tee, the tournament already felt like a war crimes tribunal. Williams posted thirty-four points despite a seven on the sixth, which by his standards constituted a minor administrative error. The real story was developing at the back of the pack, where various catastrophes were unfolding in real time.\n\nNeumann's front nine tallied twenty-one points. Redemption appeared possible. Then came the eighteenth, where five of six players recorded disasters in what can only be described as a collective psychotic break. Neumann struck a nine. Baker an eight. Mullin another eight. Williams even managed a seven, though by that point he'd already won both competitions by margins suggesting different species competing. Alex Baker's seven was somehow the least damaging option.\n\nThe final standings showed Williams twenty-one points clear in Trophy reckoning, twenty-nine strokes ahead in Jacket terms. Neumann had surged from fifth overnight to claim second despite his closing quintuple bogey, which is rather like winning the silver medal whilst on fire. Mullin posted his personal-worst thirty-three over par, completing a final round that resembled a slow-motion car crash filmed from multiple angles for educational purposes.\n\nWilliams collected his fourth Trophy and first Green Jacket. The others collected their scorecards and presumably considered different hobbies. Sixty-one total disasters across seventy-two holes. The tournament had been decided by hole four of round one and everything since had been statistical inevitability dressed as sport.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> GW 157 | SN 136 | JP 135 | JB 131 | DM 125 | AB 114</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +63 | JB +92 | DM +93 | JP +113 | SN +128 | AB +134</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nGregg Williams played seventy-two holes of golf and led for seventy-two holes of golf, which suggests either mastery or everyone else suffering from a collective virus that affected only their ability to play golf. His fourth Trophy and first Green Jacket arrived with wire-to-wire dominance that turned competition into mathematical demonstration. Eight disasters across four rounds. Five birdies. Twenty-eight pars. The rest of us recorded sixty-one disasters between us, which averages out to just over twelve each and suggests we were competing in a different sport entirely.\n\nThe margin was twenty-one points in Trophy reckoning, twenty-nine strokes in Jacket terms. Stuart Neumann claimed second despite a closing quintuple bogey that would have destroyed lesser campaigns. Jon Baker led both competitions after one hole before recording thirteen disasters that resembled a systematic deconstruction of hope. Patterson finished third despite gross scores that suggested active hostility toward par. Mullin struck one eagle and twelve disasters, which is balance of a sort.\n\nThe final hole produced five blow-ups from six players, as if the golf gods had decided to stage a commemorative disaster to mark the end of amateur ambition. Alex Baker collected his third career Wooden Spoon with thirteen zero-point holes and plus one hundred and thirty-four gross, which is consistency if nothing else.\n\nPortugal's Lisbon Coast provided four courses ranging from charming parkland to wind-battered links. Oitavos Dunes lived up to its top-one-hundred ranking by destroying most players' will to continue. Williams set a course record at Penha Longa with plus ten, which remained the standard by tournament's end and felt appropriate. He'd spent four rounds demonstrating that golf is actually quite simple when you don't record disasters every three holes. The rest of us were clearly operating from different manuals, possibly written by people who'd never seen golf before and were working from rumours they'd overheard in pubs.\n\nThe trophy presentation presumably involved Williams collecting both prizes whilst everyone else wondered whether different hobbies might be more psychologically sustainable. Williams completed the career sweep. The rest of us completed our education in futility. Same time next year, presumably.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\n**Personal Bests:**\n- Gregg Williams: 82 gross (Penha Longa, Round 3), tied for 1st of 54 rounds\n\n**Personal Worsts:**\n- David Mullin: 104 gross (Oitavos Dunes, Round 4), 55th of 55 rounds\n- David Mullin: 22 Stableford points (Oitavos Dunes, Round 4), 55th of 55 rounds\n\n**Course Records:**\n- Penha Longa: Gregg Williams 82 gross (TEG 15, Round 3), course record\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n**Disaster Distribution (Blow-ups Per Player):**\nWilliams led wire-to-wire despite recording eight disasters, which averaged two per round and constituted remarkable restraint compared to everyone else. Baker brothers combined for twenty-six blow-ups, which is practically a family business at that point. Mullin's twelve disasters included bookending round four with carnage on holes one and eighteen, suggesting a commitment to thematic consistency. Neumann's quintuple bogey finish marked his fifth zero-point hole of the tournament, though he still claimed second place, which tells you everything about everyone else's campaigns.\n\n**Front Nine vs Back Nine Performance:**\nWilliams demonstrated marginal back-nine preference across the tournament, which is what happens when you're not constantly in crisis mode. Neumann and Baker both posted strong-starter patterns through multiple rounds before various collapses reminded them that back nines exist. Patterson's front-nine excellence in round three (twenty points) was immediately followed by a fifteen-point back nine that resembled someone forgetting how golf worked halfway through.\n\n**The H18 Apocalypse:**\nThe final hole of the tournament produced five disasters from six players, which averaged out to plus four per player and suggested the golf gods had saved their best work for last. Neumann's nine and Patterson's earlier ten bookended the carnage. Williams's seven was practically conservative in context. Alex Baker's seven-and-one-point somehow constituted the least damaging outcome, which is balance of a particularly dark sort.\n\n**Course Difficulty Rankings:**\nWest Cliffs (Round 2) produced the most collective disasters with eighteen blow-ups, suggesting Cynthia Dye's links design earned its World's Best New Course award by destroying amateur golfers' confidence. Oitavos Dunes claimed second with fifteen disasters despite being Portugal's premier layout. Estoril's parkland charm still managed thirteen disasters, proving that tree-lined accuracy tests are equally capable of inducing psychological collapse. Penha Longa's mountain terrain produced the fewest disasters (fifteen) but the most spectacular individual carnage, including Alex Baker's ten on the fourteenth that appeared to break something fundamental in his relationship with the sport."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8517,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4182,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}

Stuart Neumann claimed his maiden Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance that never wavered, leading all 72 holes. Gregg Williams completed his own processional march to a second Green Jacket, also leading wire-to-wire but finishing runner-up in the Stableford. For the first time since TEG 12, the two competitions crowned different monarchs.\n\nThe tournament unfolded with the grim inevitability of a Greek tragedy performed by men with 24 handicaps. Ten birdies across 360 holes suggested either brutal course conditions or a collective abandonment of ambition. Zero eagles confirmed both. Alex Baker collected his third career Wooden Spoon with 13 scoreless holes, including a 12th-hole horror show in Round 3 that summarised his week. David Mullin's closing 45-point surge arrived too late to trouble Neumann's 13-point victory margin.\n\nThe Lisbon Coast provided the backdrop. Oitavos Dunes opened proceedings with its Atlantic winds. Troia's Robert Trent Jones Sr. design hosted Round 2. Penha Longa's mountain parkland delivered the defining H12 carnage in Round 3. Estoril's classic parkland closed the show.\n\n---\n\n## PLAYER-BY-PLAYER {.player-by-player}\n\n**Stuart Neumann (Winner, Trophy):** Secured his first Trophy with 156 points across four rounds of relentless competence, leading from H1 to H72 without once relinquishing control. His Round 3 blow-up on the 1st and Round 4's quintuple bogey on the 8th represented brief lapses in otherwise clinical execution. Finished fourth in the Jacket standings with +105 gross, proving that Stableford mastery requires consistency over brilliance.\n\n**Gregg Williams (Winner, Green Jacket; Runner-up, Trophy):** Completed wire-to-wire Jacket dominance with +66 gross, 16 strokes clear of the field, yet finished 13 points behind Neumann in the Trophy race. His 143 Stableford points revealed the harsh arithmetic: gross excellence without conversion. A Round 5 birdie and mostly steady play couldn't overcome Neumann's superior scoring efficiency.\n\n**David Mullin (3rd):** Produced the tournament's finest round with a closing 45-point masterpiece, including two birdies and an +11 gross performance. Too little, too late. His 142-point total fell 14 short of Neumann after earlier rounds failed to maintain contention. The man who could have been champion finished third.\n\n**Jon Baker (4th):** Collected 131 points whilst navigating three momentary Jacket leads during Round 2, all immediately surrendered. His Round 3 quintuple bogey on H12 defined his tournament more than any birdie. Finished with +93 gross, which somehow felt optimistic.\n\n**Alex Baker (Wooden Spoon):** Recorded 13 zero-point holes and 22 scores worse than double bogey en route to his third career Spoon. His H12 Round 3 quadruple and H12 Round 4 septuple bookended a week where hope arrived each morning and departed by the 6th. Finished 29 points behind the winner. The scorecards read like accident reports.\n\n---\n\n## Round 1: When Delusion Met Oitavos {.round1 .round}\n\nOitavos Dunes welcomed five men with varying degrees of self-belief onto its Atlantic-facing links. The wind arrived like an unwelcome dinner guest. Stuart Neumann seized the Trophy lead on the 1st hole and simply refused to let go for the next 71. Gregg Williams, Jon Baker, and David Mullin tied for the Gross lead with pars on the opening hole, establishing early credentials that would matter differently by Sunday.\n\nAlex Baker opened with a quintuple bogey, scoring zero points and establishing a pattern that would define his tournament like a recurring nightmare. By H7, Neumann had suffered his first blow-up (triple bogey, one point) whilst Alex collected another zero on the same Par 5. The 8th hole claimed Mullin and Jon Baker with matching triple bogeys. By H10, Mullin added another triple. H11 delivered Alex his third blow-up in eleven holes.\n\nThe closing stretch resembled a disaster montage. H17 produced a sextuple bogey from Alex (zero points) and another triple from Neumann. The 18th collected four blow-ups: Alex, Mullin, Jon Baker, and Neumann all recording triples. Neumann led by five points despite three blow-ups of his own. Williams and Jon Baker tied for the Gross lead at +18, three shots clear.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> SN 39 | GW 34 | JB 34 | DM 33 | AB 29</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +18 | JB +18 | DM +23 | SN +26 | AB +42</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 2: Troia's Three-Birdie Renaissance {.round2 .round}\n\nTroia's Robert Trent Jones Sr. design hosted Round 2 with the championship course's strategic demands. The front nine proceeded with mathematical grimness until H10 delivered the tournament's first genuine cause for celebration: three simultaneous birdies from Alex Baker, Jon Baker, and Stuart Neumann. It wouldn't last.\n\nAlex suffered blow-ups on H2 and H4 (both Par 3s, both triple bogeys). Neumann joined him on H4's triple. Jon Baker's triple on H7 arrived amid a round where he briefly seized the Jacket lead on H11, lost it on H12, regained it on H14, and surrendered it again on H16. Williams never relinquished Trophy control.\n\nThe back nine descended into familiar patterns. Mullin and Neumann both tripled the 8th. H13 claimed Alex and Neumann with matching triples. Neumann's H16 quadruple represented his worst hole of the round but somehow extended his Trophy lead to seven points. H17 collected both Jon Baker and Neumann with triple bogeys. Neumann's 35 points cemented his dominance despite four blow-ups.\n\nWilliams posted 30 points and +22 gross, maintaining his Jacket lead with quiet competence. His front nine featured steady pars. His back nine avoided disasters. Sometimes golf rewards the absence of catastrophe.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> SN 74 | DM 67 | JB 66 | GW 64 | AB 61</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +40 | JB +41 | DM +45 | SN +56 | AB +76</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 3: Penha Longa's H12 Apocalypse {.round3 .round}\n\nPenha Longa's mountain parkland delivered the tournament's defining moment on its 12th hole, where Jon Baker recorded a quintuple bogey that suggested existential collapse and Alex Baker added a quadruple that seemed almost sympathetic. Before the carnage, the round had proceeded with ominous normalcy.\n\nNeumann opened with a quadruple on H1, surrendering zero points. Williams and Jon Baker both tripled the 3rd. Then came redemption: Williams birdied H5, Neumann birdied H6, and Jon Baker birdied H7 before Williams immediately tripled the same hole. The narrative lurched between competence and chaos.\n\nH12 arrived like a reckoning. Jon Baker's 10 strokes represented five over par and zero Stableford points. Alex's nine strokes (four over) also scored zero. H13 added insult: Alex tripled, Jon Baker quadrupled. Neumann and Mullin both quadrupled H14. Mullin added a quadruple on H16 for symmetry. Neumann's 39-point round extended his Trophy lead to 12 points. Williams's 37 points and +15 gross strengthened his Jacket control despite three blow-ups.\n\nThe round ended with Williams demonstrating a strong back nine (22 points versus 15 on the front) whilst Alex and Jon Baker contemplated their H12 scorecards like archaeological evidence of poor decision-making.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> SN 113 | GW 101 | DM 97 | JB 99 | AB 94</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +55 | JB +66 | DM +71 | SN +82 | AB +110</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## Round 4: Estoril's Closing Arithmetic {.round4 .round}\n\nEstoril's classic parkland provided the stage for Mullin's magnificent 45-point finale and Neumann's comfortable coronation. The opener delivered immediate theatre: Alex Baker's quintuple bogey (zero points) contrasted with Neumann's birdie on H2 (five points) and Mullin's matching birdie (four points). The Trophy race ended before the turn.\n\nAlex tripled the 3rd and quadrupled the 6th, establishing familiar patterns. Mullin birdied H7, his second of the day. Neumann's quintuple on H8 represented his only serious wobble, scoring zero points but arriving with a 12-point cushion. Jon Baker tripled H9 before birdieing H10, which summarised his tournament.\n\nH11 saw Alex score four points (a personal triumph) whilst Jon Baker quadrupled. H12 delivered Alex's tournament-worst septuple bogey (11 strokes, zero points) whilst Neumann calmly collected four points. Williams quadrupled H14, his rarest mistake, but maintained Jacket dominance with +11 gross.\n\nMullin's 45 points (best round) and +11 gross (tied with Williams) secured first place for the day but second overall. Neumann's 43 points clinched the Trophy by 13. Williams completed wire-to-wire Jacket dominance by 16 strokes. Alex finished with a strong back nine (20 points versus 13 on the front), which felt like mockery.\n\n<section class=\"callout standings-box\">\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Trophy Standings:</span> SN 156 | GW 143 | DM 142 | JB 131 | AB 127</p>\n<p class=\"standings\"><span class=\"standings-header\">Green Jacket Standings:</span> GW +66 | SN +105 | DM +82 | JB +93 | AB +148</p>\n</section>\n\n---\n\n## TOURNAMENT SUMMARY {.summary}\n\nStuart Neumann claimed his maiden Trophy through 72 holes of unbroken leadership, extending his opening five-point margin to 13 by Sunday whilst never trailing. His 156 Stableford points represented consistent conversion across four rounds, demonstrating that wire-to-wire victories require sustained competence rather than moments of brilliance. Three birdies across 72 holes suggested efficient rather than spectacular golf.\n\nGregg Williams completed his own processional march to a second Green Jacket, leading all 72 gross holes and finishing 16 strokes clear with +66. His 143 Stableford points confirmed the harsh arithmetic: gross excellence without Stableford conversion leaves trophies on the table. His Round 3 back-nine surge (22 points) and consistent par golf throughout demonstrated technical superiority that somehow translated into second place.\n\nDavid Mullin's closing 45-point masterpiece (tournament-best round, +11 gross) arrived too late to threaten Neumann's control but secured third place with 142 points. His two birdies and absence of blow-ups in Round 4 suggested what might have been. Jon Baker navigated three momentary Jacket leads in Round 2 before his Round 3 H12 quintuple defined his tournament.\n\nAlex Baker's third career Wooden Spoon emerged from 13 zero-point holes, 22 scores worse than double bogey, and two H12 horrors (quadruple in Round 3, septuple in Round 4). Ten total birdies and zero eagles across 360 holes confirmed brutal scoring conditions or collective abandonment of ambition. Sixty-six blow-ups (triple bogey or worse) suggested the former. For the first time since TEG 12, Trophy and Jacket crowned different winners. Two competitions, two rulers, seventy-two holes of unbroken dominance. Mathematics never lies.\n\n---\n\n## RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS {.records}\n\nNo new TEG records or Personal Bests were set, which is probably for the best.\n\n---\n\n## OTHER STATISTICS {.stats}\n\n**Birdie Drought**: Only 10 birdies recorded across 360 holes (2.8% birdie rate), with zero eagles. Tournament featured the lowest birdie production in TEG history relative to holes played.\n\n**Zero-Point Hole Leaders**: Alex Baker led with 13 scoreless holes, followed by Jon Baker (7), Stuart Neumann (6), David Mullin (3), and Gregg Williams (2). Fifty-one combined zero-point holes across five players.\n\n**Blow-up Distribution**: 66 total blow-ups (triple bogey or worse) recorded. Alex Baker led with 20, followed by Stuart Neumann (13), Jon Baker (12), David Mullin (11), and Gregg Williams (10).\n\n**Wire-to-Wire Dominance**: Both competitions featured complete wire-to-wire victories. Neumann led Trophy for all 72 holes; Williams led Jacket for all 72 holes. First dual wire-to-wire tournament in TEG history.\n\n**Round 3 H12 Carnage**: Jon Baker's quintuple bogey and Alex Baker's quadruple combined for 19 strokes and zero Stableford points on a single Par 5. Defined the tournament.\n\n**Worst Hole Performance**: Alex Baker's Round 4 H12 septuple bogey (11 strokes on Par 4) represented the tournament's single-worst hole score. Zero points awarded.\n\n**Points Per Round Consistency**: Neumann recorded 39-35-39-43 points across four rounds (coefficient of variation: 8.7%), demonstrating remarkable Stableford consistency despite 13 blow-ups.\n\n**Gross-Stableford Divergence**: Gregg Williams's +66 gross (tournament-best) versus 143 Stableford points (2nd place) represented the largest gross-Stableford performance gap in TEG 16, highlighting the competitions' different skill requirements."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6489,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2533,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2533,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3642,"service_tier":"batch"}}}}
