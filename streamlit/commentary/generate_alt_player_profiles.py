ORIGINAL PLAYER PROFILES:
{original_content}

REQUIREMENTS FOR ALTERNATE VERSION:
1. Create 2-3 paragraphs per player covering the same performance categories
2. Remove all jokey "rankings" and satirical award sections
3. Keep factual performance data (scores, positions, key moments, streaks, etc.)
4. Player title format: "PLAYER NAME - Position Stableford (points) | Position Gross (strokes)"
5. For eagles: Simply mention them factually without excessive fanfare (e.g., "Patterson holed his second shot on Hole 2 for eagle")
6. Maintain professional but engaging tone
7. Include all players from the original
8. End with standard attribution footer

OUTPUT FORMAT:
# TEG {teg_num} - Player Profiles

---

## PLAYER NAME - Position details

[2-3 paragraphs about player]

---

[Repeat for all players]
