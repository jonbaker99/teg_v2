# TEG REPORT STYLE GUIDE - 19 ESSENTIAL RULES

## CORE FORMATTING RULES

**Rule 1: "Disaster" used MAXIMUM ONCE per report**
- Use specific scores instead: "triple bogey," "sextuple," "zero points," "+6 at the 12th"
- Rotate synonyms: implosion, meltdown, collapse, catastrophe, capitulation

**Rule 2: Maximum 3 sentences & 55 words per paragraph**
- This means ~18 words per sentence maximum
- CRUCIAL: Break longer paragraphs into multiple shorter ones
- This constraint forces clarity and readability

**Rule 3: No em-dashes (—) anywhere in the report**
- Replace with periods, commas, colons, or parentheses (use sparingly)

**Rule 4: British English throughout**
- Spelling: colour, realised, defence, centre
- Punctuation: single quotes for quotations, full stops inside quotes only if part of quoted material
- Terminology: nought not zero (when reading scores aloud)

**Rule 5: Location subtitle format**
- Directly after title: **[Location] • [Year]**
- Example: **Portugal, Lisbon Coast • 2024**

**Rule 6: At-a-Glance box contains ONLY three items**
- Trophy Winner: [Name] (number of times won, e.g. "3rd Trophy")
- Jacket Winner: [Name] (number of times won)
- Wooden Spoon: [Name] (number of times won)

**Rule 7: Split post-round standings**
- After each round: **Stableford:** (list first), then **Gross:** (list second)

**Rule 8: Player-by-Player Summary at end**
- Format: **[Name] ([Position]):** [2-3 sentence summary]
- Order: Trophy winner, runner-up(s), other placings, Spoon winner
- Maximum 3 sentences per player

## WORD LIMITS

**Rule 9: Total report maximum 2500 words**

**Rule 10: Round sections approximately 230 words total**
- Structure: ~40 word opener + ~150 word narrative + ~40 word wrap
- Balance lead battle coverage with compelling subplots

**Rule 11: Closing Verdict 150-250 words**

## BANNED LANGUAGE

**Rule 12: No gross/Stableford paradox comparisons**
- Don't use: "split personality," "paradox personified," "the format's absurdity"

**Rule 13: No self-aware humour**
- Avoid: "if you read that correctly," "yes, you heard that right," "somehow"

**Rule 14: No contrast phrases**
- Minimise: "not just X, but Y," "not only X, but also Y," "less X than Y"

## NARRATIVE FLOW

**Rule 15: Short sentences for turning points**
- Use 3-5 consecutive short sentences (5-10 words each)
- Example: "Three consecutive zeros. A quintuple at 13. Lead gone."

**Rule 16: Illustrate big claims with numbers**
- Add numbers where clear and succinct
- Example: "dominated" → "dominated, leading 67 of 72 holes"

## END SECTIONS

**Rule 17: Records and Personal Bests section**
- Title: "RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS"
- Only include actual records/PBs that beat previous bests
- Format: → **[Record type]:** [New value] (previous: [old value], [TEG/player])
- If no records: "No new TEG records or Personal Bests were set in this tournament"

## PROCESS

**Rule 18: Pre-write and verify**
- Mentally draft Tournament Verdict first, identify 3-5 essential numbers
- Before finalising: verify scores sum correctly, lead changes chronological, rankings consistent

## COMPETITION & PLAYER REFERENCES

**Rule 19: Competition structure and player names**
- **TEG Trophy (Stableford)** = PRIMARY competition (your main focus)
- **Green Jacket (Gross)** = SECONDARY competition (always mention but don't overemphasise)
- Can be won by DIFFERENT players - state both winners clearly
- Performing well in Gross without Stableford success is less newsworthy
- **Player names:** Full name on first mention (Jon Baker, Gregg Williams), then surname OR first name only
- **Exception:** Alex Baker and Jon Baker - use "Alex" and "Jon" after first mention (not surnames)

# COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

❌ Listing every hot/cold spell (pick 1-2 most impactful only)
❌ Detailed hole-by-hole for every player (focus on leaders/key moments)
❌ Repeating scores already in summary tables
❌ Over-explaining format mechanics
❌ Numbers-heavy opening paragraphs
❌ Giving blow-by-blow detail in opening (save for rounds)
❌ Rounds that are ONLY lead changes (need subplots for life)

✅ Focus on WHO, WHAT HOLE, WHAT CHANGED in lead battle
✅ Weave in compelling subplots (collapses, surges, Spoon battles, sibling rivalry)
✅ Balance lead narrative with entertaining supporting stories

---

**Your Task:**

Write a complete tournament report with this EXACT structure:

## Tournament Summary

Write 2-3 SHORT paragraphs (~150-200 words MAXIMUM) that:
- **Set the scene:** Location, atmosphere, context
- **State the outcome:** Who won Trophy, who won Jacket (names and characterisation of victory)
- **Sketch main subplots:** Runner-up battles, dramatic moments, key storylines in broad strokes
- **Minimal numbers:** Use sparingly if at all - save detailed margins/statistics for rounds

**CRITICAL: This is HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY, not detailed blow-by-blow.**
- DO name the winners and characterise how they won (wire-to-wire, comeback, etc.)
- DO mention 2-3 key supporting narratives in broad terms
- DO NOT provide detailed margins, hole-by-hole action, or comprehensive statistics
- DO NOT give away every dramatic moment (save some for the rounds)

Think of this as a newspaper headline expanded: the who, what, where, why - but not yet the detailed how.

**Example opening tone:**
"Jon Baker claimed his fourth Trophy with a wire-to-wire performance across the Portuguese coastline. Gregg Williams mounted the tournament's only serious challenge, briefly seizing the lead in Round 2. John Patterson's volatility provided the weekend's drama, his tournament swinging between brilliance and chaos."

(Notice: Winners named, victory characterised, subplots sketched, but NO specific point margins, NO hole numbers, NO detailed statistics)

## Round-by-Round Report

For EACH round, write a focused narrative section:

### Round [X]: [Catchy Title]

**Opening (~40 words, 2-3 sentences):**
- Context: standings, gaps, what's at stake
- Set up the round quickly

**How It Unfolded (~150 words, 3-4 SHORT paragraphs):**
- Tell story CHRONOLOGICALLY
- **Prioritise lead battle:** Lead changes, gap swings, who's chasing whom
- **Include compelling subplots:** Collapses, surges, battles for position, Spoon drama, sibling rivalry, notable performances
- Use specific holes for key moments
- Be selective but include the drama that brings the round to life

Example balance:
- Paragraph 1: Lead change and main battle
- Paragraph 2: Key subplot (collapse, surge, or dramatic moment)
- Paragraph 3: Supporting action (other players, Spoon battle)
- Paragraph 4: How the round resolved

**Round Wrap (~40 words, 2-3 sentences):**
- Final standings WITH GAP SIZES
- Set up tension for next round

**Target: ~230 words total per round**

### Round Standings Format:

After each round narrative, show only the cumulative totals (not per-round scores).

Use this exact 4-line “blocked text-table” format with vertical bars (|) separating players:

**Stableford Standings:** [GW 108 | JB 97 | AB 98 | DM 92 | HM 90 | SN 68]  
**Gross Standings:** [DM +60 | JB +58 | GW +85 | HM +94 | AB +115 | SN +113]

Do NOT include round scores or parenthetical totals.  
Do NOT use markdown tables — use single lines separated by vertical bars for compact readability.

## Tournament Recap

Write 2-3 paragraphs (150-250 words) that:
- **Synthesise the tournament arc:** Pull together the threads from all four rounds
- **Reflect on the outcome:** How did the winners achieve victory? What defined their performance?
- **Acknowledge supporting narratives:** Runner-up battles, collapses, Wooden Spoon, notable performances
- **Provide context:** Historical significance, career milestones, records
- **Conclude with character:** Witty observation, memorable line, personality

**CRITICAL: This is CONCLUSION and SYNTHESIS.**
- This is where you tie everything together that unfolded in the rounds
- This is where you reveal the "so what?" - what made this tournament matter
- Use specific numbers and margins to characterise performances
- Connect outcomes to Story Angles from notes

Think of this as wrapping up all loose threads: resolution, reflection, meaning, memorable exit line.

**Example recap tone:**
"Jon Baker's fourth Trophy arrived via the most commanding wire-to-wire performance in recent memory. Leading 70 of 72 holes, his six-point margin over Williams understated the control he exerted. Williams' one-hole lead in Round 2 provided brief drama before Baker's birdie snatched it back. Patterson's 49-point Round 3 explosion couldn't overcome his earlier inconsistency..."

## Required End Sections (in this order):

1. **Player-by-Player Summary** (Rule 8)
2. **RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS** (Rule 17)
3. **TOURNAMENT STATISTICS**
   - Include: highly ranked facts (2nd most, 3rd largest), interesting patterns
   - Exclude: boring/generic stats, duplicated information

---

# WRITING PRINCIPLES

**Tone by Section:**
- **Tournament Summary:** High-level summary - winners named, subplots sketched, minimal numbers
- **Rounds:** Detailed action - lead battles PLUS compelling subplots that bring the round to life
- **Recap:** Synthesis - tie threads together, specific margins/stats, reflective, witty

**Style Throughout:**
- Entertaining, dramatic, witty, economical
- Dry humour, light satire, playful language
- Balance lead narrative with subplot drama
- Never fabricate - use story notes only
- Cut ruthlessly - every word must earn its place

**Technical Conventions:**
- Gross scores: "+5 vs par" or "67 strokes"
- Stableford: "X points" (primary scoring)
- Round titles: Evocative and specific
