# TEG REPORT STYLE GUIDE - 19 ESSENTIAL RULES

## CORE FORMATTING RULES

**Rule 1: "Disaster" used MAXIMUM ONCE per report**
- Use specific scores instead: "triple bogey," "sextuple," "zero points," "+6 at the 12th"
- Rotate synonyms: implosion, meltdown, collapse, catastrophe, capitulation

**Rule 2: Maximum 3 sentences & 55 words per paragraph**
- This means ~18 words per sentence maximum
- CRUCIAL: Break longer paragraphs into multiple shorter ones
- This constraint forces clarity and readability

**Rule 3: No em-dashes (—) anywhere in the report**
- Replace with periods, commas, colons, or parentheses (use sparingly)

**Rule 4: British English throughout**
- Spelling: colour, realised, defence, centre
- Punctuation: single quotes for quotations, full stops inside quotes only if part of quoted material
- Terminology: nought not zero (when reading scores aloud)

**Rule 5: Location subtitle format**
- Directly after title: **[Location] • [Year]**
- Example: **Portugal, Lisbon Coast • 2024**

**Rule 6: At-a-Glance box contains ONLY three items**
- Trophy Winner: [Name] ([score], [margin])
- Jacket Winner: [Name] ([score], [margin])
- Wooden Spoon: [Name] ([score])

**Rule 7: Split post-round standings**
- After each round: **Stableford:** (list first), then **Gross:** (list second)

**Rule 8: Player-by-Player Summary at end**
- Format: **[Name] ([Position]):** [2-3 sentence summary]
- Order: Trophy winner, runner-up(s), other placings, Spoon winner
- Maximum 3 sentences per player

## WORD LIMITS

**Rule 9: Total report maximum 2500 words**

**Rule 10: Round sections 150-200 words total**
- Structure: ~40 word opener + ~90 word narrative + ~40 word wrap
- Be ruthless: every sentence must advance the lead battle

**Rule 11: Closing Verdict 150-250 words**

## BANNED LANGUAGE

**Rule 12: No gross/Stableford paradox comparisons**
- Don't use: "split personality," "paradox personified," "the format's absurdity"

**Rule 13: No self-aware humour**
- Avoid: "if you read that correctly," "yes, you heard that right," "somehow"

**Rule 14: No contrast phrases**
- Minimise: "not just X, but Y," "not only X, but also Y," "less X than Y"

## NARRATIVE FLOW

**Rule 15: Short sentences for turning points**
- Use 3-5 consecutive short sentences (5-10 words each)
- Example: "Three consecutive zeros. A quintuple at 13. Lead gone."

**Rule 16: Illustrate big claims with numbers**
- Add numbers where clear and succinct
- Example: "dominated" → "dominated, leading 67 of 72 holes"

## END SECTIONS

**Rule 17: Records and Personal Bests section**
- Title: "RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS"
- Only include actual records/PBs that beat previous bests
- Format: → **[Record type]:** [New value] (previous: [old value], [TEG/player])
- If no records: "No new TEG records or Personal Bests were set in this tournament"

## PROCESS

**Rule 18: Pre-write and verify**
- Mentally draft Tournament Verdict first, identify 3-5 essential numbers
- Before finalising: verify scores sum correctly, lead changes chronological, rankings consistent

## COMPETITION & PLAYER REFERENCES

**Rule 19: Competition structure and player names**
- **TEG Trophy (Stableford)** = PRIMARY competition (your main focus)
- **Green Jacket (Gross)** = SECONDARY competition (always mention but don't overemphasise)
- Can be won by DIFFERENT players - state both winners clearly
- Performing well in Gross without Stableford success is less newsworthy
- **Player names:** Full name on first mention (Jon Baker, Gregg Williams), then surname OR first name only
- **Exception:** Alex Baker and Jon Baker - use "Alex" and "Jon" after first mention (not surnames)

# COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

❌ Listing every hot/cold spell (pick 1-2 most impactful only)
❌ Detailed hole-by-hole for every player (focus on leaders/key moments)
❌ Repeating scores already in summary tables
❌ Over-explaining format mechanics
❌ Numbers-heavy opening paragraphs

✅ Focus on WHO, WHAT HOLE, WHAT CHANGED in lead battle
✅ Narrative and atmosphere in opening, numbers in rounds
✅ Selective detail that advances the story

---

**Your Task:**

Write a complete tournament report with this EXACT structure:

## Tournament Summary

Write 2-3 tight, engaging paragraphs (~250-300 words) that:
- Set the scene / location of the event
- Identify Trophy and Jacket winners **BY NAME ONLY** (save margin details for rounds)
- Weave in key storylines and narrative arcs (draw heavily from Story Angles in notes)
- Paint the picture, establish characters, create drama

**Focus on STORY over STATISTICS.**
The opening should be atmospheric and narrative-driven. Detailed numbers and margins belong in round-by-round coverage. Set the stage, don't spoil the details.

## Round-by-Round Report

For EACH round, write a focused narrative section:

### Round [X]: [Catchy Title]

**Opening (~40 words, 2-3 sentences):**
- Context: standings, gaps, what's at stake
- Set up the round quickly

**How It Unfolded (~90 words, 2-3 SHORT paragraphs):**
- BREVITY IS CRITICAL
- Tell story CHRONOLOGICALLY
- Focus ONLY on: lead changes, gap swings, key holes that changed standings
- Cut everything else
- Example: "Williams seized the lead at the 5th with four points. Baker answered immediately, his birdie at the 7th reclaiming control. The gap held at three."

**Round Wrap (~40 words, 2-3 sentences):**
- Final standings WITH GAP SIZES
- Set up tension for next round

**Target: 150 words total per round (max 200 for dramatic rounds)**

### Round Score Summaries:

**After Round 1 narrative:**
**Stableford:** [initials and points]
**Gross:** [initials and scores]

**After Rounds 2-4 narrative:**
**Round [X] scores:** [initials: gross / stableford]
**Trophy standings:** [initials and cumulative points]
**Green Jacket standings:** [initials and cumulative gross]

(Use actual data from story notes - formats above are examples)

---

## Tournament Recap

Write 2-3 paragraphs (150-250 words) that:
- Reflect on the overall tournament arc
- Highlight what made it memorable (leverage Story Angles!)
- Final thoughts on winners' performances (Trophy AND Green Jacket)
- Any historical/comparative context
- End with personality/wit

---

## Required End Sections (in this order):

1. **Player-by-Player Summary** (Rule 8)
2. **RECORDS AND PERSONAL BESTS** (Rule 17)
3. **TOURNAMENT STATISTICS**
   - Include: highly ranked facts (2nd most, 3rd largest), interesting patterns
   - Exclude: boring/generic stats, duplicated information

---

# WRITING PRINCIPLES
