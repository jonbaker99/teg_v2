## Key Features

### Data Analysis
- ✅ Round summary with before/after standings
- ✅ Hole-by-hole position changes through round
- ✅ 6-hole splits (1-6, 7-12, 13-18)
- ✅ Hole difficulty stats (hardest/easiest holes)
- ✅ Previous round comparison
- ✅ Events (eagles, disasters, key moments)
- ✅ Streaks within round
- ✅ **Tournament projections** (rounds remaining, gaps, what's needed to win)

### Forward-Looking Analysis ⭐
- Gap analysis (catchable vs insurmountable)

- What challengers need per round to catch up
- Mathematical possibilities
- Specific point targets

### Report Structure
- Round summary (what just happened)
- How it unfolded (chronological 6-hole segments)
- Standings tables (Trophy & Jacket)
- **What's At Stake** (forward-looking section)
- Round highlights
- Player summaries

## Architecture

### Two-Pass LLM System

**Pass 1: Story Notes**
```
Round Data → LLM → Structured Bullets
```
- Identifies 3-5 key storylines
- Extracts dramatic moments
- Analyzes position changes
- Creates structured notes

**Pass 2: Narrative Report**
```
Story Notes → LLM → Full Narrative
```
- Transforms bullets into prose
- Adds forward-looking analysis
- Includes "What's At Stake" section
- Creates complete markdown report

### Data Flow
```
1. load_round_report_data()
   ↓
2. get_round_storylines()
   ↓
3. format_round_data_for_prompt()
   ↓
4. generate_round_story_notes() [LLM Pass 1]
   ↓
5. generate_round_narrative_report() [LLM Pass 2]
   ↓
6. build_round_report_file()
   ↓
7. Save to data/commentary/round_reports/
```

## Data Stack (Final)

### ✅ Included
1. Round summary (scores, standings, gaps)
2. Hole-by-hole scoring
3. Position changes through round
4. Events (eagles, disasters, lead changes)
5. Streaks within round
6. 6-hole splits (1-6, 7-12, 13-18)
7. Hole difficulty (average scores)
8. Previous round comparison
9. Tournament projections (forward-looking)
10. Course metadata

### ❌ Excluded (Per User Requirements)
- Player pairings (not tracked)
- Weather data (not systematic)
- **Gross vs net divergences** (NOT INTERESTING - per user memory)
- Intra-round leaderboards (too granular)

---

## Key Calculations

1. **6-Hole Splits**
   - Holes 1-6, 7-12, 13-18
   - Sum Stableford points for each segment

2. **Hole Difficulty**
   - Average score per hole (all players)
   - Identify hardest/easiest holes

3. **Hole-by-Hole Positions**
   - Cumulative Stableford through each hole
   - Rank players after each hole
   - Track position changes

4. **Tournament Projections**
   - Max possible points remaining = (rounds_remaining × 18 × 6)
   - Points per round needed to catch leader
   - Catchable vs insurmountable gap analysis

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Ready for Live Use
The system is fully functional and ready to generate reports with actual LLM calls:

```bash
# Remove --dry-run flag to use LLM
python streamlit/commentary/generate_round_report.py 17 2
```

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (When Ready)
- [ ] Generate reports for TEG 17 rounds 1-3 with actual LLM
- [ ] Review output quality
- [ ] Refine prompts based on output if needed
- [ ] Optional: Add batch processing

### Phase 6: Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Add Streamlit UI for viewing round reports
- [ ] Integrate with existing pages (latest_round.py)
- [ ] Add navigation to round reports from results pages

## Performance

### Data Loading
- TEG 17, Round 2: ~2-3 seconds (local files)
- Includes all calculations and pattern analysis

### LLM Calls (Estimated)
- Story Notes: ~3-5 seconds
- Narrative Report: ~5-8 seconds
- **Total: ~10-15 seconds per round**

### Prompt Sizes
- Story Notes: ~14K characters (~3.5K tokens)
- Narrative Report: ~4.5K characters (~1.1K tokens)
- Uses prompt caching for efficiency
