Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy with a dramatic final-round comeback, overturning a one-point deficit to win the Stableford by three points over Gregg Williams. The finale featured five lead changes as Baker and Williams traded positions three times each before Baker seized control for good at the 13th hole with back-to-back birdies on holes 14 and 15. Meanwhile, David Mullin secured his fourth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance in the gross competition, leading for 71 of 72 holes to win by 12 strokes.

Williams' heartbreak was particularly acute—leading after Round 3 and seeking his maiden Trophy, he watched his advantage evaporate in a catastrophic final round that included a quintuple bogey on the 16th. The tournament's defining paradox belonged to Mullin, who combined crushing gross superiority with spectacular Stableford failure, finishing dead last in the points race while claiming the Green Jacket. His Round 4 collapse—30 points including three disasters—epitomized a tournament plagued by 50 combined "worse than double" scores and 35 zero-point holes.

Stuart Neumann's Round 2 brilliance—a tournament-best 45 points that briefly made him a contender—proved a mirage as he managed just 32 points over the final two rounds, his title hopes dissolving amid eight disasters.
