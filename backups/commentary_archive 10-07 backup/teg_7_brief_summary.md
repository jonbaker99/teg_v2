Henry Meller claimed his first TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire masterclass, leading for 69 of 72 holes to win by five points with 175 total. David Mullin secured his sixth Green Jacket with clinical gross dominance, finishing 15 strokes clear despite falling short in the Stableford competition. The split verdict perfectly captured the tournament's dual nature - Meller's consistency versus Mullin's power.

The breakthrough was particularly sweet for Meller, who transformed from back-to-back Wooden Spoons to champion with a Round 2 explosion of 51 points that created an insurmountable 10-point cushion. Behind him, Mullin and Gregg Williams tied for second at 170 points in a three-way Stableford dogfight that showcased tournament depth. Alex Baker claimed the Wooden Spoon on his debut, finishing 23 points adrift after a struggle punctuated by multiple disasters including a catastrophic Round 4 collapse.

Mullin's sixth Green Jacket extended his record Gross championship haul and completed his career slam, but his +53 gross score couldn't compensate for Meller's sustained Stableford brilliance. The Portuguese coast witnessed redemption, dominance, and a champion's first taste of glory.
