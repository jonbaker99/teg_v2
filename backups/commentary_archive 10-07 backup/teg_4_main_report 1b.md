## Tournament Summary

David Mullin claimed both TEG titles with a commanding performance across East Sussex and Surrey. His second Trophy and third Green Jacket arrived via relentless gross scoring dominance, leading all 72 holes by that measure whilst mounting a dramatic Stableford recovery over the final 36 holes. The margin of victory: three points in a format that promised chaos and delivered spectacularly.

Jon Baker's heartbreak defined the weekend's narrative arc. Leading the Stableford for 49 of 72 holes, Baker appeared destined for his fifth Trophy before a catastrophic final back nine yielded just nine points. Two sextuple bogeys at the 12th and 15th holes erased a lead held since Round 3, gifting Mullin the championship on the 14th hole of the final round.

Henry Meller's resilience provided the supporting drama. Recovering from a Round 1 quintuple bogey to tie for the lead after 36 holes, Meller held on for third despite 16 zero-point holes across the tournament. Gregg Williams endured a maiden Wooden Spoon, finishing 27 points behind the winner having never escaped last place after Round 1's collapse.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Ashdown

Williams seized both early leads with a par at the first. By the fourth hole, his advantage had evaporated. A quadruple bogey dropped him from contention. He would not return.

The championship's character established itself quickly: quintuple bogeys, triple bogeys in clusters, and zero-point holes in alarming frequency. Meller's quintuple at the 11th. Baker's quintuple at the 14th. Neumann's consecutive disasters at 11 and 12. The bunkerless heathland refused to yield.

Baker emerged from the carnage with a four-point cushion. Mullin, posting the day's best gross score of 23 over par, sat second. Williams and Neumann had frittered promising starts with catastrophic back nines: 10 and 11 points respectively.

**Stableford:** [JB 35 | DM 31 | GW 29 | SN 28 | HM 28]  
**Gross:** [DM +23 | JB +26 | SN +28 | HM +32 | GW +36]

## Round 2: Lingfield's Leveller

Baker extended his advantage early at Lingfield Park, a birdie at the third pushing his lead outwards. Then the format struck. Consecutive disasters at 14 and 17 cost him five and five points respectively. By the 18th, the lead had changed hands four times.

Meller produced the round of the day: 36 points whilst returning the joint-best gross score. Three consecutive pars from the ninth anchored a surge that erased Round 1's damage. Mullin, temporarily losing the lead twice on the back nine, finished level on points with Meller at 68 apiece.

Williams mounted his only Stableford recovery of the tournament. Thirteen points on the front nine became 18 on the back. It would prove insufficient to climb from fourth, the Round 1 deficit already decisive.

**Stableford:** [DM 68 | HM 68 | JB 63 | GW 60 | SN 56]  
**Gross:** [DM +45 | JB +59 | SN +55 | HM +52 | GW +71]

## Round 3: Crowborough's Carnage

The 10th hole at Crowborough Beacon became a massacre scene. Baker, Neumann, and Meller all recorded octuple bogeys. Zero points each. Only Williams escaped with four points, though by then he trailed by 41 and climbing was futile.

Baker fought back immediately: four points at the 12th restored his advantage over Mullin. Then came the 15th, where MacKenzie's design extracted its toll. Four players recorded septuple bogeys or worse. Baker among them. Zero points. Meller too. Zero points. The lead narrowed to a single point.

The final hole delivered fresh torment. Baker: octuple bogey, zero points. Mullin: septuple bogey, zero points. Meller: septuple bogey, zero points. Only Williams recorded a point. Baker clung to his lead by the thinnest margin: 107 points to Mullin's 106.

Neumann's brief surge to third came via a birdie at the fifth and 20 front-nine points. The back nine yielded 12. Meller, having tied for the lead 18 holes earlier, collected just 23 points across the round. Eight on the back nine.

**Stableford:** [JB 107 | DM 106 | SN 88 | HM 91 | GW 87]  
**Gross:** [DM +62 | JB +80 | SN +78 | HM +83 | GW +109]

## Round 4: Baker's Implosion at Bletchingley

Baker's eagle at the eighth appeared decisive. Five points. Lead extended. Mullin trailed by four. Then the parkland course extracted payment for the brilliance.

The 10th: disasters for both leaders. The 12th: Baker's sextuple bogey or worse. Zero points. The lead evaporated. The 14th: Mullin seized first place. The 15th: Baker's second sextuple bogey. Zero points. Championship over.

Mullin's back nine contained its own disasters, but he recorded 21 points where Baker managed just nine. The margin: three points. Wire-to-wire in gross scoring, come-from-behind in Stableford. Both titles secured.

Meller climbed to second overall with 34 points despite a quintuple at the 11th. Neumann matched Baker's final-round total of 32 points, his consistent gross scoring securing second place in that competition. Williams, with 23 points and a round gross of 43, set unwanted personal records. His tournament tally: 14 zero-point holes.

Baker's front nine yielded 23 points. His back nine: nine. A 49-hole lead dissolved across 90 minutes of golf.

**Stableford:** [DM 137 | JB 134 | HM 121 | SN 120 | GW 110]  
**Gross:** [DM +81 | SN +100 | HM +107 | JB +113 | GW +152]

## Tournament Recap

Mullin's dual championship arrived through contrasting routes to the same destination. His gross scoring dominance never wavered: 64 of 72 holes spent in the lead, culminating in wire-to-wire victory by 19 strokes. The Stableford required greater persistence. Trailing for 57 holes, he led just 15 before seizing permanent control with four holes remaining.

Baker's collapse will define this tournament's memory. Leading for three rounds, his advantage remained intact through 63 holes. Nine holes later, he trailed by three. The numbers tell the story: 49 holes in first place, two sextuple bogeys in Round 4, zero points at the 12th and 15th. An eagle at the eighth merely delayed the inevitable.

The tournament's volatility extended beyond the lead battle. Meller tied for first after 36 holes despite recording five quintuple bogeys across four rounds. Williams never escaped the Spoon position after his opening-round collapse, yet mounted the only Stableford recovery in Round 2. The collective carnage: 52 triple bogeys or worse, with the 15th hole in Rounds 3 and 4 claiming 16 disasters alone.

Mullin's consistency provided the counterpoint. Never spectacular in Stableford, consistently excellent in gross scoring. When Baker imploded, Mullin absorbed the pressure without flinching. The maiden TEG visit to East Sussex crowned a worthy double champion.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**David Mullin (1st):** Swept both competitions with contrasting styles. Wire-to-wire gross dominance spanning all 72 holes anchored a come-from-behind Stableford victory sealed in Round 4. Never led Stableford until seizing control with four holes remaining, yet never relinquished gross first place from the opening round.

**Jon Baker (2nd):** Led Stableford for 49 of 72 holes before a catastrophic final back nine yielded just nine points. Sextuple bogeys at the 12th and 15th holes erased a one-point advantage, transforming certain victory into three-point defeat. An eagle at Round 4's eighth briefly extended his lead before the collapse arrived.

**Henry Meller (3rd):** Recovered from Round 1 quintuple bogey to tie for lead after 36 holes with tournament-best 36 points in Round 2. Sixteen zero-point holes across four rounds failed to prevent third-place finish, demonstrating remarkable resilience amid sustained carnage.

**Stuart Neumann (4th):** Consistent gross scoring secured second place in that competition despite fourth-place Stableford finish. Never contended for either lead after Round 1's back-nine collapse, yet maintained steady performance throughout.

**Gregg Williams (5th):** Maiden Wooden Spoon arrived via opening-round implosion from which he never recovered. Led briefly at first hole before collapsing to last place permanently. Fourteen zero-point holes and 28 triple bogeys or worse defined a tournament to forget, finishing 27 points behind the winner.
