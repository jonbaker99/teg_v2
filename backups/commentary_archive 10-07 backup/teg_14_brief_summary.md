David Mullin claimed his third TEG Trophy and tenth Green Jacket with a wire-to-wire masterclass that saw him lead for 60 of 72 holes in Stableford and an astonishing 70 of 72 in gross. His back-to-back 40-point rounds in the opening two days built a nine-point cushion that proved just enough—Alex Baker's final-round charge of 43 points closed the gap to two, but Mullin's consistency (never worse than 36 points) carried him home to victories by two points and seven strokes.

Baker's late surge made it tense, but his catastrophic sextuple-bogey on the 16th in Round 4 likely cost him the Trophy. The real drama unfolded at the bottom, where Jon Baker collected his first career Wooden Spoon despite firing four birdies in the final round and posting the tournament's best gross score (83). His wild variance—five birdies total but eleven zero-point holes including five disasters in Round 3 alone—epitomized a tournament defined by brutal patches overwhelming brilliant moments.

Gregg Williams claimed third with steady bogey golf throughout, while Baker's paradox will echo through TEG history: five birdies, first spoon. In Kent's unforgiving links conditions where only nine birdies surfaced across 288 holes, Mullin's dominance stood alone—the only player to lead after all four rounds in both competitions.
