# Mullin's Masterclass: Clinical Gross Dominance Seals Double Triumph

**East Sussex, England • 2011**

David Mullin claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket with a display of ruthless gross scoring across the Sussex and Surrey countryside. Leading the Jacket competition for 64 of 72 holes, he swept both titles with 137 points and +81 gross, winning the Jacket by a commanding 19 strokes over Stuart Neumann and edging Jon Baker by three points for the Trophy.

Baker's tournament became a Greek tragedy in miniature. Holding the Trophy lead for 49 holes across three days, he arrived at the final round one point clear. Then came the collapse: zeroes at the 10th, 12th, and 14th, an 11 at the 15th. When Mullin seized the lead at the 14th hole, he never relinquished it. Baker's eagle at the par-four 8th—only the second in tournament history—offered brief redemption but couldn't prevent his 54-hole advantage evaporating into runner-up status.

Gregg Williams claimed the inaugural Wooden Spoon, finishing 27 points behind in the Trophy and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket. Henry Meller's tournament peaked with a 36-point second round at Lingfield before fading. In conditions that yielded just seven birdies across 360 holes, suffering was universal—62 zero-point disasters scattered throughout the field testified to courses that extracted punishment without mercy.

## Round 1: Five-Way Chaos at Ashdown

Jon Baker seized the opening advantage with 35 points at Royal Ashdown Forest, establishing a four-point cushion. The bunkerless heathland extracted its toll through natural hazards alone, with David Mullin grinding out the day's best gross score of 91 strokes to lead the Jacket by three.

Baker's 35-point haul masked volatility. A catastrophic nine at the 14th—a quintuple bogey bleeding zero points—nearly derailed him before a timely par at the 15th restored control. Mullin's consistency at the top proved more valuable than brilliance, though even he suffered a trio of zeroes including disasters at the 12th and 14th.

Henry Meller endured the round's defining nightmare: a 12 at the par-three 11th, a quintuple or worse that obliterated momentum and yielded zero points. Gregg Williams posted 29 points despite his own implosion—an eight at the fourth costing him the Trophy lead he'd briefly held after a birdie at the eighth. Stuart Neumann joined the carnage club with disasters at the 11th, 12th, and 18th, his 28 points keeping him within touching distance despite the chaos.

## Round 2: Meller's Moment at Lingfield

Henry Meller produced the tournament's finest Stableford round with 36 points at Lingfield Park, vaulting into a tie with Mullin atop the leaderboard at 64 points. The parkland's tree-lined fairways and water hazards proved marginally kinder than Ashdown's heathland brutality.

Meller's surge featured level-par golf from the 9th through 11th holes, a stretch of stability in a tournament defined by volatility. Baker's challenge faltered with zeroes at the 14th and 17th—the latter a nine that mirrored his Round 1 disaster. Williams collected 31 points but his prospects dimmed with implosions at the 3rd, 8th, and 9th holes, including a nine at the par-five 9th.

Mullin extended his Jacket lead to 45 strokes despite his own struggles. Zeroes at the 1st, 17th, and 18th—including a nine at the final hole—barely dented his gross dominance. Baker's 28 points dropped him to fourth in the Trophy race as the competition reshuffled. Neumann's recovery from opening-hole disasters kept him lurking in third.

## Round 3: Baker Reclaims Lead at Crowborough

Jon Baker stormed back with 39 points at Crowborough Beacon, seizing a one-point advantage over Mullin heading into the final round. The MacKenzie-designed holes at elevation proved no less treacherous, but Baker's front nine of 22 points propelled him clear.

The lead changed hands three times through the opening 11 holes. Mullin took control with a par at the 10th when Baker, along with Meller and Neumann, all recorded eights at the par-five. Baker reclaimed the lead at the 11th, registering four points at the par-four 12th to edge ahead. Williams, languishing in fifth, managed 27 points despite consecutive zeroes at the 2nd, 4th, and 5th holes.

The 15th hole delivered carnage: all five players recorded zeroes. Williams posted an eight, Meller and Neumann both sevens, Baker an eight. Even the leaders weren't immune. Mullin closed with a seven at the 18th for zero points, while Baker and Meller both registered eights at the final hole. Mullin's Jacket lead extended to 16 strokes despite the rough finish, his gross consistency maintaining dominance even as the Trophy slipped away.

**Stableford Standings:** [JB 103 | DM 102 | SN 88 | HM 87 | GW 87]  
**Gross Standings:** [DM +62 | SN +78 | JB +80 | HM +83 | GW +109]

## Round 4: Final-Round Implosion at Bletchingley

David Mullin seized the Trophy lead at the par-three 14th and never looked back, his 36-point final round at Bletchingley Golf Club clinching both competitions. Jon Baker's tournament unravelled in spectacular fashion: zeroes at the 10th, 12th, and 14th, then an 11 at the par-five 15th that extinguished any hope of recovery.

Baker had briefly reclaimed the lead with a birdie at the par-three 2nd after Mullin stumbled with a seven at the 7th for zero points. Then came the eagle—a two at the par-four 8th—that electrified the round and temporarily masked the gathering storm. But the stretch from the 9th through 15th proved catastrophic: Baker averaged nearly four over par across those seven holes, including the +12 bloodbath.

Mullin's own struggles included zeroes at the 7th and 10th, but his damage control proved superior. His Jacket dominance never wavered, maintaining the lead throughout the entire round. Williams' 23-point finale confirmed his Spoon status, consecutive zeroes at the 13th and 14th emblematic of a final round that featured blow-ups at the 5th, 6th, 10th, and 11th as well.

Henry Meller collected 34 points with a birdie at the par-five 6th but couldn't overcome disasters at the 11th and 15th—both double-digit scores yielding zero points. Neumann's 32 points secured third overall in both competitions, his consistency across four days rewarded with a podium finish.

**Stableford Standings:** [DM 137 | JB 134 | SN 120 | HM 121 | GW 110]  
**Gross Standings:** [DM +81 | SN +100 | HM +107 | JB +113 | GW +152]

## Tournament Recap

David Mullin's double triumph arrived via contrasting paths: wire-to-wire Jacket dominance shadowed by a Trophy competition he led for just 15 of 72 holes. His +81 gross score established him as the tournament's most reliable ball-striker, winning the Jacket by 19 strokes over Stuart Neumann. The three-point Trophy margin over Jon Baker understated the final-round theatre but confirmed Mullin's ability to deliver when the pressure mounted highest.

Baker's collapse stands as one of the most dramatic reversals in TEG history. Holding the Trophy lead for 49 holes across three and a half rounds, his 54-hole advantage evaporated in a seven-hole stretch that yielded just three points. The eagle at the par-four 8th—a moment of brilliance that briefly reignited hope—only served to highlight what might have been. His 134 points and +113 gross left him runner-up in both competitions, a fate particularly cruel given his lengthy spell atop the standings.

Williams' inaugural Spoon reflected consistent struggles rather than isolated disasters. Finishing 27 points behind in the Trophy and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket, he recorded 14 zero-point holes across the week. Meller's tournament peaked with that glorious 36-point second round at Lingfield before fading to fourth, his 121 points including the catastrophic 12 at Ashdown's 11th in Round 1.

The scoring conditions proved brutally difficult: just seven birdies total across 360 holes, with 62 zero-point disasters scattered throughout. Mullin's two birdies matched Baker's haul, though Baker's eagle represented the week's singular moment of magic. In a tournament where everyone suffered, Mullin suffered least—and that clinical approach to damage limitation delivered both titles.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**David Mullin (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Swept both competitions with ruthless gross dominance, leading the Jacket for 64 of 72 holes despite holding the Trophy lead for just 15. His wire-to-wire Jacket performance featured the tournament's most consistent ball-striking, winning by 19 strokes over Neumann. Ten zero-point holes reflected the brutal conditions but couldn't derail his clinical march to a second Trophy and third Jacket.

**Jon Baker (2nd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Led the Trophy for 49 holes across three and a half rounds before a catastrophic final-round collapse cost him the title. His eagle at the par-four 8th in Round 4—only the second in tournament history—provided the week's most brilliant moment. Eleven zero-point holes included multiple disasters, but it was the stretch from holes 10-15 in the final round (+12) that proved fatal, converting a one-point lead into a three-point deficit.

**Henry Meller (4th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Produced the tournament's best Stableford round with 36 points at Lingfield in Round 2 but couldn't maintain the momentum. His catastrophic 12 at the par-three 11th in Round 1 set the tone for a week that included 16 total zero-point holes. Finished fourth in the Trophy with 121 points and third in the Jacket at +107, his consistency across the middle rounds undone by opening and closing volatility.

**Stuart Neumann (3rd Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Claimed podium finishes in both competitions with steady if unspectacular golf. His 120 points and +100 gross reflected consistent avoidance of the worst disasters, though 11 zero-point holes showed he wasn't immune. A birdie at the par-four 5th in Round 3 represented rare scoring success in brutal conditions. Finished 17 points behind Mullin in the Trophy but a distant 19 strokes back in the Jacket.

**Gregg Williams (5th Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Claimed the inaugural Wooden Spoon with 110 points and +152 gross, finishing 27 points behind in the Trophy and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket. His 14 zero-point holes included multiple disasters across all four rounds, with the final round's 23 points confirming his basement status. Brief moments of competence—a birdie at the 8th in Round 1, four points at the 10th in Round 3—couldn't overcome pervasive struggles with damage control.
