Jon Baker claimed his third TEG Trophy and first Green Jacket with a commanding performance that saw him lead for 59 of 72 holes in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross scoring. His wire-to-wire dominance delivered final margins of six points and three strokes, sweeping both competitions for the first time since TEG 8. The tournament turned decisively on holes 6 and 7 of the final round, where Baker reclaimed the Stableford lead he'd lost the previous day and never looked back.

The real drama belonged to Alex Baker's stunning collapse. Leading by two points after 54 holes, Alex hemorrhaged 15 Stableford points in Round 4, posting five disasters including four zero-point holes to finish second, six points back. The younger Baker's tournament epitomized the wild volatility that defined TEG 11—his rounds ranged across 14 gross strokes while brother Jon's steady consistency (standard deviation of just 3.77 points per round) proved the winning formula across 39 combined zero-point holes in the field.

David Mullin authored the tournament's most extraordinary paradox: finishing second in gross scoring (+73, just three strokes behind Jon) yet dead last in Stableford points (125), earning the Wooden Spoon. His ability to score well overall while stumbling catastrophically on individual holes—two disasters in both Rounds 3 and 4—captured the essence of a tournament where volatility, not brilliance, separated champion from also-ran.
