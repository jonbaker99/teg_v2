# Patterson's Steady Hand Claims Second Trophy in Catalonian Contrast

**Catalonia, Spain • 2019**

John Patterson secured his second Trophy with a display of metronomic consistency across the Catalonian coast, his 172-point victory built on steadiness rather than spectacle. The 10-point margin over Gregg Williams understated the control Patterson exerted, leading 48 of 72 holes despite averaging 24-over per round. Williams had led through 36 holes before a catastrophic back nine in Round 3 handed Patterson the initiative he never surrendered.

Jon Baker claimed his second Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance, leading all 72 holes to win by eight strokes. His closing 89 at PGA Catalunya Stadium set a new course record, capping a Gross performance that never looked threatened. The split verdict—Trophy and Jacket won by different players—marked only the second such division since TEG 9, highlighting the divergent skills required for net and gross supremacy.

David Mullin's tournament encapsulated golf's cruelty. Second-best gross scorer on 71-over, he claimed his third Wooden Spoon after a disastrous opening to Round 4 sealed his Stableford fate.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos and Early Disasters

Williams emerged from the Tour Course opener with a one-point Trophy lead, his 46 points edging Patterson's 45 despite both players enduring early carnage. Patterson's quintuple-bogey 12 at the fourth appeared terminal, yet he responded with six consecutive scoring holes from the seventh, collecting four points at both the eighth and ninth.

Baker's round contained the day's starkest contrast. A birdie at the third briefly gave him the Trophy lead before the disaster at four—a septuple-bogey yielding zero points—dropped him to fourth. He recovered with another birdie at 14 to share the Gross lead with Williams at 12-over, but his Stableford ambitions had already suffered irreparable damage.

Stuart Neumann endured the field's worst gross round, his 33-over featuring a dozen at the 15th and a 10 at the 13th. Alex Baker's back-to-back disasters at the opening holes—septuple-bogey, sextuple-bogey—left him with a single point from two holes.

**Green Jacket Standings:** JBa +12 | GW +12 | DM +17 | JP +24 | ABa +30 | SN +33

## Round 2: Williams Holds On, Baker Seizes Gross Control

Williams maintained his one-point Trophy advantage despite an early scare, his disaster at the fourth costing him the Gross lead. Baker's birdie at 11 and Williams' birdie at the 10th—where Alex Baker also found red numbers—kept the Jacket race locked at 28-over apiece through 36 holes.

Patterson remained within striking distance, his 42 points keeping him one behind Williams despite a disaster at three and a quintuple at 15. The latter dropped him briefly from the Trophy lead, but his consistency elsewhere limited the damage. David Mullin produced the day's finest Gross round, 12-over on a course where level par remained mythical.

Neumann climbed to third in the Trophy standings with 44 points, his stretch from holes four through nine yielding 19 points including a birdie at six. Alex Baker's round split dramatically—14 points on the front, 23 on the back—but disasters at seven and nine kept him firmly in sixth.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 88 | JP 87 | SN 80 | JBa 76 | DM 75 | ABa 71  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JBa +28 | GW +28 | DM +29 | JP +48 | ABa +54 | SN +54

## Round 3: Patterson Pounces as Williams Implodes

The Stadium Course's third-round examination produced the tournament's decisive shift. Patterson's 45 points opened an eight-point gap over Williams, whose round collapsed spectacularly on holes 12 and 13. The first—a triple-bogey eight at the par-five 12th—cost him the Trophy lead. The second—an 11 at the par-four 13th—all but ended his chances.

Williams had carded just a single point from those two holes, his Gross scoring averaging 12-over across the stretch. Patterson, despite his own disaster at three and another at seven, responded with a birdie at 15 and accumulated 19 points from holes 12 through 17. Baker's birdie at 12 gave him sole possession of the Jacket lead, his 18-over Round 3 the day's best Gross effort.

Mullin's 30 points represented the field's weakest Stableford performance, yet his 22-over Gross kept him second in that competition. Alex Baker endured disasters at both two and four, accumulating one point from three holes as his Trophy hopes evaporated.

**Trophy Standings:** JP 132 | GW 124 | SN 115 | JBa 110 | ABa 103 | DM 105  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JBa +46 | DM +51 | JP +71 | GW +56 | ABa +83 | SN +84

## Round 4: Baker's Record Seals Gross Glory

Patterson's opening disaster at the first—his fourth triple-bogey of the week—briefly threatened his Trophy control, but the margin proved insurmountable. His 40 points extended the lead to 10 over Williams, whose 38-point finale couldn't close the gap. Patterson's four-round scoring variance of just two strokes gross—the smallest in tournament history—defined his victory. Every round produced between 40 and 45 points.

Baker's closing 89 shattered the Stadium Course record, his 17-over representing the week's finest single-round Gross performance. A disaster at seven and another at nine failed to derail his march to an eight-stroke Jacket victory, his lead maintained across all 72 holes. Five birdies across four rounds underscored his Gross superiority.

Mullin's Spoon fate was sealed early. Back-to-back disasters at three and four—a quadruple and a double respectively—left him scoreless through four holes. He rallied with birdies at 12 and 14, but finished 33 points behind Patterson in Stableford despite being second-best gross scorer on 71-over.

Neumann provided the week's lone eagle, a three at the par-five 15th yielding five points in a 40-point finale. His Stableford finish at 155 points secured third place, though his 108 gross left him bottom of the Jacket standings.

**Trophy Standings:** JP 172 | GW 162 | SN 155 | JBa 145 | ABa 143 | DM 139  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JBa +63 | DM +71 | GW +76 | JP +96 | ABa +104 | SN +108

## Tournament Recap

Patterson's second Trophy arrived via the most consistent performance in TEG history. His gross scoring variance of two strokes—40, 42, 45, 40 in Stableford; 96, 96, 95, 97 in Gross—represented machine-like reliability despite averaging 24-over per round. Leading 48 of 72 holes, he withstood Williams' early challenge and capitalised ruthlessly when his opponent faltered.

Williams' tournament turned on two Stadium Course holes. The 11 at the par-four 13th in Round 3—yielding zero points and costing him seven strokes to par—epitomised his volatility. Having led the Trophy for 33 holes, he surrendered the advantage and couldn't reclaim it, falling 10 points short despite 162 points total.

Baker's Jacket dominance contrasted sharply with his Stableford struggles. Leading the Gross competition wire-to-wire, his 63-over winning margin of eight strokes reflected consistent excellence. Five birdies and a closing course-record 89 highlighted his ball-striking prowess, yet 145 Stableford points left him fourth in the Trophy race, 27 points behind Patterson.

Mullin's paradox defined the week's storyline. Second-best gross at 71-over, he claimed his third Wooden Spoon with 139 Stableford points. His Round 4 opening collapse—scoreless through four holes including disasters at three and four—sealed a fate no amount of late brilliance could reverse. Neumann's eagle at 15 on the final day provided the tournament's lone five-pointer, a rare moment of excellence in his 108-over week.

The split verdict—first since TEG 9—underscored the format's dual demands. Patterson's metronomic net play trumped all comers in Stableford. Baker's Gross control never wavered. Both champions earned their trophies through contrasting skills, their victories intersecting only in their decisive nature.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**John Patterson (1st Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Claimed his second Trophy with the steadiest performance in tournament history, his two-stroke gross variance across four rounds unprecedented. Led 48 of 72 holes despite averaging 24-over, proving consistency trumps flash in Stableford. Absorbed early disasters—quintuple at hole four in Round 1, disaster at hole three in Round 3—yet never carded below 40 points.

**Gregg Williams (2nd Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Led the Trophy through 33 holes before catastrophic back-nine collapse in Round 3 ended his challenge. His 11 at the par-four 13th—zero points, seven over par—epitomised a round where holes 12-13 yielded a single point. Finished 10 points behind Patterson despite leading at halfway and carding 162 points total.

**Stuart Neumann (3rd Trophy, 6th Jacket):** Produced the tournament's only eagle, a five-pointer at the par-five 15th in Round 4 highlighting rare excellence in an otherwise volatile week. Recovered from disastrous Round 1—33-over including a dozen at 15—to claim third place with 155 points. His 108 gross left him bottom of the Jacket standings.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Secured his second Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance, leading all 72 holes to win by eight strokes. Closing 89 at Stadium shattered the course record, capping a Gross performance built on five birdies and relentless consistency. His 145 Stableford points left him fourth in Trophy, 27 behind Patterson, illustrating the format's divergent demands.

**Alex Baker (5th Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Endured catastrophic opening to Round 1—back-to-back disasters yielding one point from two holes—yet recovered to finish fifth with 143 points. Strong back-nine scoring in Rounds 2 and 4 couldn't offset front-nine struggles, his 104 gross leaving him mid-pack in Jacket race.

**David Mullin (6th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Claimed his third Wooden Spoon despite being tournament's second-best gross scorer on 71-over, the format's cruelty laid bare. Round 4 opening collapse—scoreless through four holes including disasters at three and four—sealed Stableford fate no amount of late brilliance could reverse. Late birdies at 12 and 14 provided only consolation.
