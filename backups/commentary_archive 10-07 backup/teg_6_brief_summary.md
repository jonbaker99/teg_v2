Gregg Williams claimed his first TEG Trophy with a wire-to-wire victory that epitomized survival over style. His tournament-record 48-point opening round built a cushion that withstood three subsequent gross collapses (+32, +35, +41), clinging to a three-point margin over Jon Baker's late charge. David Mullin secured his fifth Green Jacket with steady gross play, leading for 62 of 72 holes despite never threatening the Stableford competition—the first time in tournament history the Trophy and Green Jacket were won by different players.

Baker's valiant pursuit fell agonizingly short after closing a nine-point gap to three in the final round. The defining moment came on Round 3's 18th hole when Baker's par seized the gross lead from Mullin, who suffered a +4 disaster, yet Williams's collapsing gross scores proved irrelevant to his Stableford dominance. The tournament descended into chaos across all rounds—just six birdies total against 47 disasters and 39 zero-point holes—making Williams's early brilliance the decisive factor in his redemption arc after a previous wooden spoon finish.
