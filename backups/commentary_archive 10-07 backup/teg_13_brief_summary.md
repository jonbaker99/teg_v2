Jon Baker claimed his fourth TEG Trophy and third Green Jacket with a commanding wire-to-wire performance that saw him lead for 70 of 72 holes in Stableford and every single hole in Gross. His 6-point Stableford margin and 18-stroke Gross advantage over Gregg Williams represented total control from the opening birdie on H3 of Round 1. The only drama came at H15 of Round 2 when Williams briefly seized the Stableford lead, only for Baker to snatch it back with a birdie three holes later.

Williams mounted the tournament's most serious challenge, finishing second in both competitions despite that fleeting one-hole advantage. The real fireworks came from John Patterson's roller-coaster ride to third place—his tournament featured both the best round in TEG 13 history (49 points in Round 3) and the worst gross round of the week (36 in Round 1), plus an eagle and triple bogey in the same final round. David Mullin's quintuple bogey on H10 of Round 4 sealed his fourth career Wooden Spoon, a cruel punctuation on what had been a respectable Gross performance (third place, +80).

The split between Stableford and Gross performances told contrasting stories throughout: Alex Baker and Patterson tied for third overall at 141 points despite a staggering 47-stroke Gross difference, while Mullin's third-place Gross finish couldn't prevent Spoon ignominy in Stableford. Baker's dominance was absolute—leading all 72 Gross holes marks the most comprehensive wire-to-wire victory in TEG 13 history.
