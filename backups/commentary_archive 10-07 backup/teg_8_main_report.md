The Lisbon Coast hosted a rare phenomenon: two utterly separate championships unfolding simultaneously across four spectacular Portuguese courses. Gregg Williams seized the TEG Trophy from the opening holes at Quinta da Marinha and never relinquished control, leading 63 of 72 holes. David Mullin mounted an equally commanding performance in the Green Jacket competition, controlling the gross leaderboard from Round One with the same iron grip. Neither man trailed for more than a fleeting moment across four days of golf that moved from Robert Trent Jones Sr.'s pine-forested parkland to his son's dramatic Sintra mountains, back to Quinta da Marinha, before finishing at Portugal's premier links, Oitavos Dunes.

Williams constructed his 12-point victory with devastating efficiency. Twin 41-point rounds in Rounds Two and Four established breakaway leads that no challenger could seriously threaten. Even a stumbling 29-point Round Three at Quinta da Marinha—featuring consecutive disasters at the 10th and 11th—left him with sufficient cushion to cruise home. His final tally of 149 points represented complete dominance of the Stableford format, built on relentless scoring rather than spectacular flourishes.

The Green Jacket narrative ran parallel but distinct. Mullin shared the opening-round lead with Jon Baker before seizing outright control with a stunning 14-stroke Round Two at Penha Longa. His birdie at the 6th was the round's sole red number amid widespread carnage. Baker mounted a brief challenge in Round Three, briefly taking the lead, but Mullin responded immediately and closed out his seventh Green Jacket with authority, birdieing both the 13th and 16th at Oitavos Dunes. The victory tied him for most Green Jackets in TEG history.

Alex Baker provided the tournament's most dramatic surge, vaulting from distant third to runner-up with a blistering final-round 39 points. Stuart Neumann's tournament unfolded at the opposite end of the spectrum: 23 disasters across 72 holes delivered his second career Wooden Spoon by an 11-point margin.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Quinta da Marinha

Williams established early authority with a five-point burst at the 10th hole, seizing the Stableford lead as Alex Baker imploded to +4 at the same hole. Baker's round disintegrated spectacularly: disasters at the 8th, 10th and 12th preceded a catastrophic closing stretch. Quintuple bogeys at the 17th and 18th, sandwiching another disaster at the 16th, yielded zero points from the final three holes.

The gross competition saw equal drama. Mullin's birdie at the second claimed an early lead. Jon Baker surged into contention with four points at the 17th, but his quintuple bogey at the 13th had already cost him control. Mullin and Baker finished deadlocked at +20, whilst Williams took the gross lead briefly at the 11th before sliding back.

Neumann's horror show began immediately: disasters at the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th yielded consecutive zeros. His 17-point total set an all-time TEG worst for a single round.

**Stableford:** GW 38, JB 34, AB 30, DM 30, HM 29, SN 17  
**Gross:** DM +20, JB +20, GW +26, HM +29, AB +41, SN +43

## Round 2: Penha Longa Carnage

Williams extended his Stableford lead to 11 points with a commanding 41-point display, despite a quintuple bogey disaster at the 12th where his ball found a 10 on the par five. Four-point scores at the 7th and 10th built an impregnable advantage through the front nine.

Mullin broke away in the gross competition with surgical precision. His birdie at the 6th—the round's only red number—anchored a 14-stroke performance that seized outright control. Jon Baker's disaster at the same hole cost him ground he would never recover.

The 16th hole delivered mass destruction. Henry Meller and Neumann both posted quintuple bogey nines on the par four. Alex Baker, Williams and Jon Baker all recorded triple bogeys or worse. Five players, zero points. Meller's round featured disasters at the 12th, 13th, 16th and 17th. Neumann added zeros at the 10th and 12th to his collection.

**Round 2 scores:** GW 24/41, AB 34/36, DM 14/36, JB 19/34, SN 27/31, HM 30/27  
**Trophy standings:** GW 79, JB 68, AB 66, DM 66, HM 56, SN 48  
**Green Jacket standings:** DM +34, JB +40, GW +50, HM +59, SN +70, AB +75

## Round 3: Quinta da Marinha Redux

Jon Baker mounted the tournament's most serious challenge, firing 35 points and briefly seizing the gross lead at the 12th. His birdie at the 17th capped a strong back-nine rally that moved him to within five points in the Trophy race.

Williams wobbled badly through the middle holes. Consecutive disasters at the 10th and 11th cost him six points, trimming his Stableford cushion to five. His 29-point round marked his lowest output, yet the margin remained comfortable.

Mullin's gross lead proved more volatile. Baker took control at the 12th before Mullin reclaimed it at the 15th, only to lose it permanently at the 17th. The lead changed hands three times in six holes.

Neumann endured another nightmare: quintuple bogeys at the 1st, 4th, 9th and 10th. His 20-point total left him anchored to last place.

**Round 3 scores:** JB 18/35, GW 35/29, HM 24/34, AB 40/32, DM 26/26, SN 43/20  
**Trophy standings:** GW 108, JB 103, AB 98, DM 92, HM 90, SN 68  
**Green Jacket standings:** JB +58, DM +60, GW +85, HM +83, AB +115, SN +113

## Round 4: Oitavos Dunes Finale

Williams delivered a knockout 41-point performance to secure his second TEG Trophy by 12 points. A disaster at the 5th barely registered. Twenty-four back-nine points sealed the comprehensive victory.

Alex Baker's stunning 39-point surge propelled him from third to second place, leapfrogging Jon Baker and Mullin in the Stableford standings. His charge faltered only at the 18th, where a quintuple bogey provided a sour finish.

Mullin closed out his seventh Green Jacket with authority despite Jon Baker's opening-hole disaster handing him breathing room. Birdies at the 13th and 16th extended his margin to six strokes. Baker's disasters at the 8th and 10th ended his challenge.

Meller suffered a catastrophic early collapse: disasters at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th yielded two points from six holes. His round deteriorated to +40, a 16-stroke meltdown that dropped him to last in the gross standings.

**Round 4 scores:** GW 22/41, AB 33/39, DM 17/34, SN 24/32, JB 25/28, HM 40/21  
**Final Trophy standings:** GW 149, AB 137, JB 131, DM 126, HM 111, SN 100  
**Final Green Jacket standings:** DM +77, JB +83, GW +107, HM +123, SN +137, AB +148

## Tournament Recap

Gregg Williams and David Mullin authored a narrative of parallel dominance, each controlling their respective competitions with wire-to-wire authority. Williams' triumph rested on two breathtaking 41-point rounds that bookended a four-day performance marred only by Round Three's wobble at Quinta da Marinha. His 149-point total, constructed without a single birdie listed in the notes yet built on relentless accumulation, represented the tournament's defining accomplishment. Leading 63 of 72 holes in Stableford speaks to control rarely seen in TEG history.

Mullin's seventh Green Jacket—tying him for the all-time record—came through equally commanding means. His Round Two 14 at Penha Longa, featuring the round's sole birdie amid wholesale destruction, established control he never surrendered. Four total birdies across 72 holes proved sufficient when combined with rock-solid ball-striking that avoided the disasters plaguing his competitors. Leading 63 of 72 holes in gross mirrored Williams' dominance in a tournament that resembled two separate contests sharing the same courses.

Alex Baker's final-round 39-point explosion provided the tournament's most thrilling subplot. Trailing by 10 points entering Oitavos Dunes, his surge past Jon Baker and Mullin in the Stableford standings salvaged a disappointing start. His quintuple bogey at the 18th cost him nothing in the final reckoning but denied him the satisfaction of an unblemished finish.

Stuart Neumann's 23 disasters across four rounds—most in tournament history by considerable margin—delivered his second Wooden Spoon. Quintuple bogeys became routine: the 1st, 4th, 9th and 10th in Round Three alone. His 17-point opening round set an all-time TEG worst. That he recovered to post 32 points in the finale speaks to perseverance if nothing else.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**Gregg Williams (1st - Trophy):** Delivered wire-to-wire dominance with 149 points, leading 63 of 72 holes. Twin 41-point rounds in Rounds Two and Four established breakaway leads that withstood a wobbling 29-point Round Three. Sealed his second TEG Trophy with a 12-point margin built on relentless scoring rather than pyrotechnics.

**Alex Baker (2nd - Trophy):** Surged from distant third to runner-up with a spectacular final-round 39 points at Oitavos Dunes. Opening-round disasters—including consecutive quintuple bogeys at the 17th and 18th—left him chasing throughout. His closing charge past Jon Baker and David Mullin in the Stableford standings provided the tournament's most dramatic arc.

**Jon Baker (3rd - Trophy, 2nd - Jacket):** Mounted the tournament's most serious challenge with a Round Three 35 that briefly seized the gross lead. Four points at the opening-round 17th showcased his best form, but disasters at crucial moments—the 13th in Round One, the 8th and 10th in Round Four—cost him realistic chances in both competitions.

**David Mullin (4th - Trophy, 1st - Jacket):** Claimed his seventh Green Jacket—tying the all-time TEG record—with wire-to-wire control spanning 63 of 72 holes. His stunning Round Two 14 at Penha Longa, featuring the round's sole birdie, established command he never surrendered. Closing birdies at the 13th and 16th at Oitavos Dunes sealed a six-stroke victory built on consistency rather than fireworks.

**Henry Meller (5th):** Endured a catastrophic final-round collapse, posting +40 with disasters at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th yielding just two points from six holes. His quintuple bogey nine at the 16th in Round Two, matched by Stuart Neumann on the same hole, encapsulated a tournament of wild volatility. Dropped to last in gross standings after the finale.

**Stuart Neumann (6th - Wooden Spoon):** Suffered through 23 disasters across 72 holes—the most in tournament history—to claim his second career Wooden Spoon by 11 points. His opening-round 17 points set an all-time TEG worst. Quintuple bogeys became routine: four alone in Round Three. That he recovered to post 32 points in Round Four demonstrated resilience amid the wreckage.
