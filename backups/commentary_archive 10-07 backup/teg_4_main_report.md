# Mullin Claims Double Despite Trophy Nail-Biter

**East Sussex, England • 2011**

David Mullin swept both competitions in TEG's maiden voyage to East Sussex, claiming his second Trophy and third Green Jacket across four demanding courses. His clinical dominance in gross scoring proved decisive, leading the Jacket battle for all 64 holes before seizing the Trophy in a dramatic final-round surge. Jon Baker, holding a one-point Trophy lead through 54 holes, watched his advantage evaporate in a calamitous stretch that saw him bleed points to finish three behind. Gregg Williams endured a miserable week, collecting his first Wooden Spoon after 62 zero-point holes scarred the tournament.

## Round 1: Carnage at Ashdown

Baker led by four after the opening round at Royal Ashdown Forest, but the bunkerless heathland exacted a brutal toll. All five players hit bottom. Williams opened with an 8 at the fourth, surrendering the Trophy lead. Henry Meller's catastrophic 12 at the par-3 11th—the worst single-hole score yet recorded in TEG history—left him with zero points and +9 against par. Stuart Neumann joined the carnage at the same hole with a 7, also registering nothing. Baker's own 9 at the 14th briefly threatened his advantage before he steadied with par at the 15th to reclaim first place.

Only seven birdies materialised across 90 holes of play, testimony to Ashdown's relentless challenge. David Mullin, trailing by four in the Trophy, quietly led the Jacket by three strokes. Williams' front-nine 19 points dissolved into a back-nine 10.

## Round 2: Five-Way Chaos

Lingfield Park's mature parkland setting brought more misery. Baker's birdie at the third briefly restored order before Williams and Meller both struck 8s and 9s. Neumann opened with consecutive blow-ups—a 6 at the first, a 9 at the second—scoring zero on both. The lead changed hands five times across 18 holes. Mullin seized control at the 11th, lost it at the 12th, reclaimed it at the 14th with a par whilst Baker collapsed to a 6, then surrendered it again at the 18th after his own 9.

Meller's 36-point round—the tournament's finest Stableford performance—lifted him into a tie with Mullin atop the Trophy standings. Mullin extended his Jacket margin to 22 strokes despite the final-hole implosion. Baker, haemorrhaging points late with blow-ups at the 14th and 17th, slipped to fourth in the Trophy, trailing the leaders by one.

**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +45 | HM +52 | SN +55 | JB +59 | GW +71

## Round 3: Baker Edges Ahead

Crowborough Beacon's MacKenzie-designed holes provided the stage for Baker's resurgence. Meller's opening 7 cost him the Trophy lead; Mullin's 6 at the second handed it to Baker. Williams continued his descent, recording zeros at the second, fourth, and fifth—averaging 3-over per hole across the front nine. Neumann's birdie at the fifth offered brief resistance before the par-5 10th delivered simultaneous disasters: Meller, Baker, and Neumann all carded 8s for zero points. Mullin's par earned three points and the lead.

Baker clawed back with four points at the 12th, regaining first place. The 15th proved the round's nadir: all five players registered blow-ups, none scoring points. By the 18th, three players—Williams, Mullin, and Meller—had recorded 7s for zero. Baker clung to a one-point advantage over Mullin entering the final round. Mullin's Jacket lead stretched to 16 strokes.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 103 | DM 102 | HM 87 | SN 88 | GW 87  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +62 | SN +78 | JB +80 | HM +83 | GW +109

## Round 4: Mullin Strikes at Bletchingley

Mullin seized the Trophy lead at Bletchingley's opening hole with a 5 for two points. Baker responded with a birdie at the second to edge back ahead. Then came the par-4 eighth: Baker's eagle—only the second in tournament history—seemed to settle matters. It proved an illusion. From the 10th onwards, Baker imploded. Consecutive blow-ups at the 10th, 12th, 14th, and 15th cost him 16 strokes and yielded just one point across five holes. His 9 at the 12th and 11 at the 15th epitomised the collapse.

Mullin's 6 at the 14th earned two points whilst Baker registered zero. The lead changed hands for the final time. Mullin extended his advantage through the closing stretch, finishing with 36 points to Baker's 32. Williams endured his worst round yet—23 points and 43 over par—cementing the Wooden Spoon. Meller's birdie at the sixth and Neumann's solid 32 points provided scant consolation in a disaster-filled finale.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 137 | JB 134 | HM 121 | SN 120 | GW 110  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +81 | SN +100 | HM +107 | JB +113 | GW +152

## Tournament Recap

Mullin's double triumph arrived via starkly contrasting routes. His wire-to-wire Jacket dominance—leading all 64 holes and finishing 19 strokes clear of Neumann—showcased relentless gross scoring. Yet in the Trophy, he trailed for 57 of 72 holes before his final-round 36 points overhauled Baker's collapse. Baker's eagle at the eighth, the tournament's most spectacular moment, couldn't prevent the haemorrhage that followed: 23 strokes over par from holes 10 through 15 obliterated his 54-hole lead.

Williams' inaugural Spoon capped a miserable week. Fourteen zero-point holes and 152 strokes over par left him 27 points behind in the Trophy and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket. Meller's 12 at Ashdown's 11th, the single worst score in four TEG tournaments, epitomised a field that registered 62 zeros across 360 holes. Only seven birdies materialised all week. Mullin's ability to avoid catastrophic blow-ups—ten zeros, but none bunched—proved the difference. Baker's 11 zeros, clustered fatally in Round 4, cost him both titles. East Sussex had delivered brutality. Mullin, clinical and composed, claimed the spoils.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**David Mullin (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Swept both competitions with clinical consistency, leading the Jacket battle for all 64 holes whilst patiently stalking Baker in the Trophy. His final-round 36 points capitalised on Baker's implosion, converting a one-point deficit into a three-point victory. Ten zero-point holes scattered across four rounds never derailed his momentum, whilst two birdies underscored rare moments of brilliance in brutal conditions.

**Jon Baker (2nd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Led the Trophy for 49 of 72 holes before a calamitous final-round collapse from the 10th onwards. His historic eagle at Bletchingley's eighth—only the second in tournament history—briefly suggested dominance, but consecutive blow-ups at holes 10, 12, 14, and 15 yielded just one point and cost him the title. Eleven zero-point holes, fatally clustered late, left him three points behind and nursing regret.

**Henry Meller (3rd Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** His tournament oscillated between brilliance and disaster. Round 2's 36-point masterclass—the week's finest Stableford performance—lifted him into a share of the lead, but catastrophic scores bookended his campaign. A 12 at Ashdown's par-3 11th remains the worst single-hole score in TEG history, whilst 16 total zeros left him fourth overall despite flashes of quality.

**Stuart Neumann (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Finished runner-up in the Jacket, 19 strokes behind Mullin, with steady gross scoring that belied his Stableford struggles. His Round 3 birdie at the fifth provided a rare highlight, but 11 zero-point holes—including opening disasters at Lingfield's first and second—cost him Trophy contention. A solid 32-point final round secured fourth place, just one point behind Meller.

**Gregg Williams (5th Trophy, 5th Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Claimed his first Wooden Spoon after a miserable week that yielded 14 zero-point holes and 152 strokes over par. Consecutive blow-ups marred every round, culminating in a catastrophic 43-over final round at Bletchingley—a personal worst. Led the Trophy for 13 fleeting holes before descending into last place, finishing 27 points behind Mullin and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket.
