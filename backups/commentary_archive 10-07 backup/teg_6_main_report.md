# TEG 6: Williams Survives 48-to-28 Collapse to Claim Wire-to-Wire Trophy as Mullin Masters Gross

The inaugural Catalonian chapter of the TEG chronicles delivered split champions, dramatic unravelings, and the kind of improbable arithmetic that makes handicap golf both maddening and magnificent. Gregg Williams, posting the tournament's best round (48 points) followed by its three worst gross scores (+32, +35, +41), somehow clung to a wire-to-wire Stableford victory by three points over Jon Baker. Meanwhile, David Mullin—leading the gross competition for 62 of 72 holes despite never threatening the Stableford trophy—secured his fifth Green Jacket with a four-stroke margin. For the first time in tournament history, the trophy and jacket diverged into separate hands, validating the dual-competition structure while showcasing the beautiful paradox at golf's handicapped heart.

Williams's triumph represented redemption after five tournaments of near-misses and outright disasters: one wooden spoon, one runner-up finish, and a catalogue of might-have-beens. His Round 1 masterclass at PGA Catalunya Tour Course—an all-time TEG record 48 points anchored by birdies at the 11th and 14th—created a nine-point cushion that survived three subsequent rounds of spectacular gross deterioration. The final round epitomised his survival act: posting just 28 points and a tournament-worst +41 gross while Baker closed to within three points, Williams held on through sheer force of that opening statement. It was wire-to-wire vindication built on front-loaded brilliance and back-end grit.

Mullin's gross dominance told a different story entirely. Leading from the second hole of Round 1 through most of the tournament, he surrendered the lead only briefly on the 18th hole of Round 3—when his quadruple-bogey disaster handed it to Baker's steadying par—before reclaiming it in Round 4 with characteristic consistency. His gross scoring range (17 to 29 over par) stood in stark contrast to Williams's volatility (20 to 41), yet his Stableford returns (28-37 points) never mounted a serious trophy challenge. Five jackets, zero trophies: Mullin's mastery of absolute scoring without handicap magic remains the tournament's defining paradox.

Baker's valiant pursuit provided the tournament's dramatic spine. Nine points adrift entering the final round, he mounted a 32-point charge that cut the gap to three, taking brief Stableford and gross leads on Round 4's front nine before disasters at the ninth (+6) and subsequent holes ended his hopes. His two birdies and fighting spirit couldn't overcome Williams's opening-round cushion, but his runner-up finish in both competitions—four strokes behind Mullin in gross, three points behind Williams in Stableford—marked him as the tournament's unluckiest competitor.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Williams Unleashes Record-Breaking Statement at PGA Catalunya Tour

The inaugural TEG descent upon Catalonia began with Gregg Williams delivering a Stableford masterpiece for the ages. His 48-point Round 1—setting an all-time TEG record and personal gross best of +20—at PGA Catalunya Tour Course wasn't merely dominant; it was the kind of opening salvo that reshapes tournaments before they've properly begun. While David Mullin and Jon Baker traded the lead through the opening holes—Mullin taking it at the first, Williams snatching it at the second, Mullin reclaiming it at the third—the eventual champion seized control at the fifth and never relinquished it for 67 more holes.

Williams built his record through surgical excellence on the inward stretch. After a wobbly middle section including a triple-bogey at the eighth, he ignited from the ninth hole with an 11-point surge culminating in a birdie at the 11th. His hot spell continued through holes 10-15, accumulating 22 points with another birdie at the 14th and a four-pointer at the 15th. The back nine yielded 28 points—eight more than his front nine—transforming a solid round into an historic one. That nine-point cushion over Baker's 39-point effort would prove just enough to survive the coming storms.

Baker's 39 points and personal-best +18 gross looked respectable until context arrived. His front nine collapsed under triple-bogeys at the first and fourth, burying him in a 13-point deficit. The back nine offered redemption: his 26-point surge, powered by a birdie at the 17th, demonstrated the fighting spirit that would characterise his tournament. Yet he'd already spotted Williams too much rope, and the gap proved insurmountable despite matching Williams's back-nine excellence.

Mullin's 37 points and tournament-best gross of +17 established his credentials as the man to beat in absolute scoring, if not Stableford. His consistency—no disasters, steady accumulation—foreshadowed his eventual jacket dominance. Stuart Neumann (34 points) and Henry Meller (31 points) rounded out the field, both suffering multiple disasters including Neumann's quintuple-bogey at the ninth and Meller's quadruple-bogeys at the seventh and 15th. The tone was set: Williams dominant, Mullin consistent, Baker chasing.

**Round 1 Standings:** GW 48pts/+20, JB 39pts/+18, DM 37pts/+17, SN 34pts/+26, HM 31pts/+29

### Round 2: Williams Survives Disaster-Laden +32 to Maintain Nine-Point Cushion

If Round 1 showcased Williams's brilliance, Round 2 at Costa Brava revealed his capacity for survival through catastrophe. Posting just 36 points—12 fewer than his opener—and a gross score of +32 littered with six disasters across 18 holes, Williams somehow maintained his nine-point Stableford lead through sheer force of his opening cushion. The disasters came in clusters: at the second and third holes, at the seventh (a quadruple-bogey zero), and a brutal stretch from the 14th through 16th where he accumulated three consecutive disasters. Yet his birdie at the 17th (four points) provided just enough oxygen to stay ahead.

David Mullin seized the gross lead Williams had briefly held, posting +17—matching his Round 1 performance—with characteristic consistency across 18 holes. His steady excellence never wavered: no disasters, no drama, just relentless accumulation of pars and bogeys that showcased why he'd lead the gross competition for 62 of 72 holes. His 37 Stableford points kept him in third place overall, but the trophy was never his fight—the jacket was always the prize he sought.

Henry Meller emerged as Round 2's revelation, posting a personal-best 41 points and +17 gross to vault from fifth to third in the standings. His hot spell from holes 7-12 yielded 18 points, anchored by a four-pointer at the 12th. After a disaster at the fourth hole, Meller found rhythm with three consecutive pars from holes nine through 11, showcasing the kind of consistency that had eluded him in Round 1. His back-nine brilliance (24 points) erased the memory of his opening-round struggles.

Baker's 36 points and +21 gross kept him second but didn't close the gap. His front nine featured disaster and redemption in equal measure: a triple-bogey zero at the second followed by a birdie-four at the 10th, then another triple-bogey zero at the 11th. The see-saw continued, but Williams's cushion proved too substantial to erode. Neumann's 37 points maintained fourth place despite a disaster at the 10th and another at the 15th, while Williams's remarkable feat—leading by nine despite the tournament's worst gross score of the round—set up a tense back nine holes.

**Round 2 Standings:** GW 84pts/+52, JB 75pts/+39, HM 72pts/+46, DM 74pts/+34, SN 71pts/+47

### Round 3: The 18th Hole Coronation—Baker Seizes Gross Lead as Mullin's Disaster Strikes

El Prat's Rosa Course delivered drama concentrated into a single, decisive hole. For 17 holes, David Mullin maintained his gross lead with steady, unremarkable golf that had become his trademark. Then came the 18th: Mullin's quadruple-bogey disaster (zero points) coincided with Jon Baker's steadying par (three points) to flip the gross leaderboard on the tournament's penultimate hole. Baker, posting 35 points and +23 gross for the round, took the gross lead into the final day while Williams's 33-point effort (+35 gross) maintained his seven-point Stableford cushion.

The round unfolded as a masterclass in survival through adversity. Williams's front nine (14 points) showcased his struggles: disasters mounted, including a quadruple-bogey zero at the seventh that briefly threatened his lead. His back nine recovery (19 points) steadied the ship, but the gap to Baker narrowed from nine points to seven. The trajectory was clear: Williams's cushion was eroding, and Baker's consistency—despite his own disasters at the seventh and eighth—was making the final round a genuine contest.

Baker's 35-point round featured the same boom-bust pattern that defined his tournament. His front nine disasters at holes seven and eight—including a quintuple-bogey zero at the eighth—buried him in yet another deficit. But his back nine surge (20 points) showcased his resilience, culminating in that tournament-defining par at the 18th that seized the gross lead from Mullin's grasp. Five points behind Williams with 18 holes remaining, Baker's charge set up a tense finale.

Stuart Neumann posted the round's best score—36 points and +22 gross—to maintain third place overall, seven points behind Baker and 14 behind Williams. Meller's nightmare round (25 points, +37 gross) featured disasters at the first, seventh, eighth, 15th, and 17th holes, dropping him firmly into wooden spoon contention. Mullin's 28-point round—his tournament worst—threatened his jacket hopes until the final round would reveal his true class.

**Round 3 Standings:** GW 117pts/+87 (Stableford lead), JB 110pts/+62 (Gross lead), SN 107pts/+69, DM 102pts/+63, HM 97pts/+83

### Round 4: Three-Point Survival—Williams Holds Off Baker's Charge as Mullin Reclaims Jacket

The final round at PGA Catalunya Stadium Course descended into chaos before settling into a three-point survival story. Gregg Williams, posting the tournament's worst score—28 points and +41 gross—somehow clung to his wire-to-wire Stableford lead as Jon Baker's 32-point charge fell just short. The early holes told the tale: Williams's disasters at the third, sixth, and seventh holes saw Baker briefly seize the Stableford lead at the seventh, but Williams reclaimed it at the 10th and never let go despite posting just 10 points on the front nine.

Baker's pursuit epitomised valiant failure. His 32-point round closed the seven-point gap to three, aided by Williams's front-nine collapse. But Baker's own disaster—a sextuple-bogey zero at the ninth—handed David Mullin the gross lead back, and Baker's subsequent struggles (27 gross for the round) meant his brief gross lead at the 16th lasted just two holes before Mullin's steadiness reclaimed it. Finishing three points behind Williams in Stableford and four strokes behind Mullin in gross, Baker's double runner-up status stung with what-might-have-been.

Mullin's final-round masterclass—33 points and +22 gross—secured his fifth Green Jacket with characteristic efficiency. His front nine (19 points) was the round's best, featuring a birdie at the fourth and three consecutive pars from holes eight through 10. His back nine (14 points) steadied enough to hold off Baker's late charge. Leading the gross for 62 of 72 holes, Mullin's jacket victory was never in doubt after Round 1, even as the Stableford trophy remained forever beyond reach.

Stuart Neumann's 32-point round matched Baker's effort, securing third place overall but never threatening the leaders. Henry Meller's 26-point finish (35 gross) confirmed his wooden spoon, a tournament marred by disasters at every turn. Williams's closing stretch—disasters at holes 15 and 16, followed by an 18-point back nine that barely salvaged survival—represented the most improbable wire-to-wire victory in TEG history. Leading by nine, then seven, then three, Williams discovered that sometimes the biggest opening statement simply needs to last 72 holes.

**Final Standings:** GW 145pts/+128 (Trophy), JB 142pts/+89 (-3pts, -4 strokes), SN 139pts/+97 (-6pts), DM 135pts/+85 (Jacket, -10pts, +4 strokes), HM 123pts/+118 (-22pts)

## Tournament Recap

The inaugural Catalonian TEG rewrote tournament logic through the prism of split champions and improbable arithmetic. Gregg Williams's wire-to-wire Stableford triumph—built on a record-breaking 48-point opening statement followed by three rounds of spectacular gross deterioration—proved that cushions created early can survive storms weathered late. His three-point margin over Jon Baker represented the narrowest escape after leading by nine, seven, and seven through successive rounds. David Mullin's fifth Green Jacket—secured through leading the gross competition for 86% of holes played—showcased absolute scoring mastery divorced from handicap magic. For the first time, the trophy and jacket diverged, validating the dual-competition structure and highlighting the paradox that defines amateur golf: consistency in absolute scoring doesn't guarantee Stableford dominance.

Baker's double runner-up finish—three points behind Williams, four strokes behind Mullin—marked him as the tournament's most compelling tragic figure. His valiant final-round charge, closing from nine back to three, fell short against Williams's opening cushion. His brief seizure of the gross lead on Round 3's 18th hole, only to surrender it again in Round 4, epitomised the fine margins separating glory from heartbreak. Stuart Neumann's consistent third-place finish and Henry Meller's disaster-plagued wooden spoon rounded out a field that delivered just six birdies across 360 holes—Williams's three, Baker's two, and Mullin's solitary strike at Round 4's fourth—while posting 47 disasters and 39 zero-point holes.

The Spanish sojourn will be remembered for Williams's redemption arc: from wooden spoon recipient to wire-to-wire champion, proving that front-loaded brilliance survives back-end collapse. Mullin's gross mastery without Stableford success adds another layer to his TEG legacy: five jackets, zero trophies, and the question of whether absolute excellence matters without handicap advantage. The 48-to-28 collapse that somehow secured victory? Pure TEG chaos—where the biggest opening statement in tournament history proved just enough to survive the most improbable survival act ever witnessed. Wire-to-wire vindication, indeed. Redemption after wooden spoon. Three-point survival through record-breaking brilliance followed by spectacular unraveling. Welcome to Catalonia, where the trophy and jacket finally went their separate ways.
