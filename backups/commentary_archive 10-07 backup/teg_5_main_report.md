# TEG 5: Baker's Dramatic Comeback Conquers Volatile Portuguese Finale

Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy with a thrilling final-round surge that epitomized the chaos of this extraordinary tournament in the Algarve. Starting Round 4 one point back, Baker's 42-point performance featured five lead changes—the most volatile finish in TEG history—as he held off Gregg Williams' maiden Trophy bid by three points. The real paradox of TEG 5, however, belonged to David Mullin, who clinched his fourth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire Gross dominance (leading 71 of 72 holes) while simultaneously finishing dead last in Stableford, 20 points behind the winner. This historic contradiction—Gross champion as Trophy wooden-spooner—defined a tournament where disasters outnumbered birdies three-to-one and 50 "worse than double" scores littered the scorecards across four punishing rounds.

Williams' heartbreak proved equally compelling. The perennial bridesmaid led after Round 3, seeking his first Trophy in what seemed destined to be his coronation. Instead, Baker's comeback and Williams' final-round fade (38 points including a quintuple-bogey disaster on 16) left him three agonizing points short of breakthrough glory. Stuart Neumann's tournament arc told another story: his Round 2 masterclass (45 points, the tournament's best round) disintegrated into Rounds 3-4 misery, averaging just 32 points as eight disasters sabotaged his challenge. The epidemic nature of the carnage became the tournament's defining characteristic—35 zero-point Stableford holes recorded, disaster holes at nearly three times the rate of birdies, and carnage distributed with cruel impartiality across the field.

Returning to Portugal after a two-TEG gap since TEG 3, the familiar confines of Boavista hosted three rounds before the finale moved to the new challenge of Palmares. The venue switch for Round 4 coincided with the tournament's most dramatic swings, though whether Palmares deserved credit or blame for the volatility remained debatable. What wasn't debatable: Baker's resilience under pressure, Mullin's Gross mastery despite Stableford struggles, and Williams' continued search for that elusive first Trophy.

## Round 1: Mullin's Early Statement, Baker's Late Resilience

Boavista opened the tournament with immediate fireworks. David Mullin signaled his Gross intentions from the third hole, striking a birdie to seize both leads simultaneously. Another birdie at the fifth extended his advantage as Stuart Neumann's triple-bogey dropped him to fifth. The early narrative seemed clear: Mullin in command, the field scrambling. Jon Baker had other ideas, though his path featured characteristic volatility. His quintuple-bogey disaster at the sixth—an eight on a par-3—represented the kind of catastrophe that typically ends Trophy challenges before they begin.

Yet Baker's response defined his tournament character. A birdie at the sixteenth lifted him into the Stableford lead as Mullin's momentum stalled on the back nine. Gregg Williams contributed his own disaster at seventeen (quintuple bogey, nine on a par-4), while Baker's closing zero at eighteen—an eight on a par-4—somehow didn't prevent him maintaining a one-point lead. Harry Mullin's birdie at ten briefly threatened, climbing from fifth to third, but the round ultimately belonged to Baker's improbable resilience and David Mullin's Gross dominance. Mullin's front nine (22 points) showcased his strength, setting up a pattern that would define his week.

The standings crystallized with intrigue: Baker 40 points leading Stableford by one over Mullin (39), with Williams (36) lurking three back. In Gross, Mullin's +12 led by eight strokes—a statement of intent that foreshadowed his wire-to-wire command. Neumann's 30-point last-place finish belied his +26 Gross position, setting up the paradoxes that would define this tournament. The battle lines were drawn, though nobody could have predicted the carnage ahead.

## Round 2: Neumann's Brilliance, Mullin's Lead Seizure

The second round at Boavista produced the tournament's finest individual performance and most chaotic leaderboard warfare. Stuart Neumann's 45-point explosion—featuring birdies at three, eight, and ten, with his hot spell from holes 8-10 yielding 11 points—represented the tournament's peak brilliance. His front nine (25 points) was flawless, temporarily erasing memories of Round 1's struggles. Yet even Neumann couldn't escape the disaster plague: a triple bogey at six and quadruple catastrophe at eighteen (among three zero-point finishes) illustrated how quickly fortune turned at Boavista.

The lead changed hands four times in a dizzying display. Baker lost it immediately with a second-hole disaster (triple bogey), regained it briefly at six (4 points), then surrendered it permanently when Mullin's eighth-hole birdie established control. Gregg Williams briefly threatened at eleven (4 points taking the lead), but his own disaster at fourteen (quadruple bogey) and Mullin's immediate response ended that challenge. Mullin's closing quadruple bogey at eighteen proved immaterial—he'd built sufficient cushion, his 40-point round (matching Round 1's 40-point output) maintaining momentum despite late carnage.

Henry Meller's round encapsulated the tournament's brutal nature: a strong front nine (19 points) dissolved into back-nine disasters at fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen—consecutive calamities scoring just one point from holes 14-16. His 30-point finish (11-point back nine) represented the dangers lurking for everyone. Williams' 42 points kept him within a point of the lead despite his own disaster at eight (quadruple bogey), while Baker's 36 points (including disaster at two) left him three back. The standings compressed: Mullin 79 points led Williams (78) by one, Baker (76) three back, Neumann (75) four back despite his heroics. Only Meller (64 points, 15 back) seemed out of contention.

**Round 2 Scores:** SN 45pts/+11, GW 42pts/+27, DM 40pts/+11, JB 36pts/+22, HM 30pts/+30 | Cumulative: DM 79pts, GW 78pts, JB 76pts, SN 75pts, HM 64pts

## Round 3: Disaster Epidemic, Williams' Maiden Lead

Round 3 at Boavista descended into wholesale carnage, featuring 26 combined disasters—more than one per player per front nine. Mullin opened with a birdie, immediately surrendering it with a second-hole disaster (triple bogey) as Neumann also recorded a disaster at two. Williams seized the lead at three (4 points) as the tournament's character fundamentally shifted from competition to survival. Every contender suffered grievously: Williams endured disasters at eight, nine, twelve, and seventeen. Neumann posted disasters at two, seventeen, and eighteen. Mullin absorbed disasters at two, ten, thirteen, and seventeen. Baker weathered disasters at seven (quintuple bogey) and eighteen (quintuple bogey), the latter costing him the lead gained at seventeen.

The lead changed hands three times in the final holes alone. Baker's sixteenth-hole birdie set up his seventeenth-hole surge to first place, only for his eighteenth-hole quintuple-bogey disaster (zero points) to gift it straight back to Williams. Neumann's concurrent eighteenth-hole disaster and Meller's eighteenth-hole triple bogey completed the closing chaos. Nobody emerged unscathed; Williams' 37 points won the round by virtue of slightly less catastrophe than his competitors, claiming a one-point lead over Baker (38 points) entering the final round.

The collapse stories were everywhere. Mullin's 27-point disaster-fest—his personal-worst Stableford round—dropped him from first to fourth, nine points back. Neumann's 32 points (back nine of 13) erased his Round 2 brilliance, leaving him eight back in third. Even Meller, with 36 points, remained 15 back in fifth despite a solid performance. But the key narrative was Williams finally holding the lead, seeking his maiden Trophy after years as perpetual runner-up, with Baker one point behind and hunting his second title.

**Round 3 Scores:** JB 38pts/+24, GW 37pts/+32, HM 36pts/+20, SN 32pts/+27, DM 27pts/+27 | Cumulative: GW 115pts (leader), JB 114pts (-1), SN 107pts (-8), DM 106pts (-9), HM 100pts (-15)

## Round 4: Five Lead Changes, Baker's Redemption

The tournament finale at the new Palmares course delivered unprecedented volatility. Five lead changes across eighteen holes—Baker and Williams trading the advantage three times each—transformed the final round into pure theater. Baker seized the lead immediately at the first hole, extended it with a birdie at three (4 points), then promptly obliterated it with a fifth-hole quintuple-bogey disaster (zero points). Williams reclaimed the lead only to surrender it back at six when Baker responded and Williams suffered his own triple-bogey disaster.

The pattern repeated with ruthless regularity. Baker's eighth-hole disaster (triple bogey, zero points) handed the lead back to Williams. But the decisive sequence came from holes twelve through fifteen, where Baker's final surge coincided with Williams' collapse. Mullin struck consecutive birdies at twelve and thirteen, the latter accompanied by Baker's 4-point effort that reclaimed the lead for the final time. Baker's consecutive birdies at fourteen and fifteen (both 4 points) stretched the advantage as Williams lost the lead permanently at fourteen and then cratered with a sixteenth-hole quintuple-bogey disaster (zero points).

Neumann's tournament ended with four disasters including consecutive triple bogeys at ten and eleven (both zero points) and an opening disaster at three. His 32 points mirrored Round 3's misery, finishing fourth overall. Mullin's round encapsulated his tournament paradox: two birdies and three disasters, scoring just 30 points (his second consecutive sub-30 round) to finish last in Stableford, yet his +22 Gross performance combined with his cumulative dominance secured the Green Jacket by 12 strokes. He led the Gross competition for 71 of 72 holes without ever converting it to Trophy success.

Baker's 42-point championship round (18 over par) featured three birdies against two disasters—the resilience formula that delivered his second Trophy. Williams' 38 points left him agonizingly close, his maiden Trophy bid falling three points short. Harry Meller's 39-point round (17 over par, his personal best Gross) lifted him to third overall, while Neumann and Mullin completed the field.

**Round 4 Scores:** JB 42pts/+18, HM 39pts/+17, GW 38pts/+32, SN 32pts/+24, DM 30pts/+22 | Final: JB 156pts/+84 (Trophy), GW 153pts/+126 (-3), HM 139pts/+90 (-17), SN 139pts/+88 (-17), DM 136pts/+72 (-20, Green Jacket winner)

## Tournament Recap

TEG 5 will be remembered for its contradictions and chaos. Jon Baker's second Trophy came via the most dramatic final-round comeback to date—five lead changes, one-point deficit erased, three-point victory margin—showcasing his ability to absorb disasters and respond with birdies at crucial moments. His path featured seven birdies against six disasters across four rounds, yet he led the Stableford standings for just 20 of 72 holes, taking command only when it mattered most. The final-round duel with Williams provided the drama, but Baker's resilience from Round 1 onwards—surviving that sixth-hole quintuple bogey to maintain the lead—established the foundation for his triumph.

The tournament's defining paradox belonged to David Mullin, whose fourth Green Jacket came with unprecedented dominance (leading 71 of 72 Gross holes, winning by 12 strokes) while simultaneously finishing dead last in Stableford, 20 points behind Baker. No TEG champion had ever achieved such wire-to-wire Gross control nor finished so far back in the primary Trophy competition. His Round 2 equaled the Gross co-record (11 over par), yet his Rounds 3-4 collapse (27 and 30 points) illustrated the brutal handicap arithmetic that could crown him Gross champion while relegating him to wooden spoon. The four-time Green Jacket winner has never claimed the Trophy—a record both impressive and frustrating.

Gregg Williams' maiden Trophy heartbreak continued his bridesmaid status. Leading after Round 3, he appeared destined for breakthrough glory until the final round's four disasters (including that sixteenth-hole quintuple bogey) condemned him to second place, three points short. Stuart Neumann's tournament arc—from Round 2's 45-point brilliance to Rounds 3-4's combined 64 points and eight disasters—captured the tournament's unforgiving nature. That Round 2 performance remains the tournament's best single round, yet it couldn't survive the carnage that followed. The statistics told the brutal story: 50 "worse than double" disasters, 35 zero-point Stableford holes, birdies outnumbered by disasters at nearly three-to-one. TEG 5 was survival golf, and Jon Baker survived best.
