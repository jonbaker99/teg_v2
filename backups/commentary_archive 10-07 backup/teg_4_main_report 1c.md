# Mullin's Sweep: Clinical Gross Mastery Overcomes 54-Hole Collapse

**East Sussex, England • 2011**

David Mullin claimed his second Trophy and third Green Jacket with a performance of ruthless gross efficiency and Stableford vulnerability across four new courses in the Sussex countryside. Leading the Jacket wire-to-wire over 72 holes, Mullin nonetheless trailed Jon Baker's Trophy charge for 57 of them before seizing the lead at the 14th hole of the final round. Baker's devastating collapse from a 54-hole advantage handed Mullin a three-point Trophy margin to match his commanding 19-stroke Jacket superiority.

The tournament unfolded as a tale of two formats. Mullin's 81-over-par total dominated the gross competition from the opening tee at Ashdown's bunkerless heathland through to Bletchingley's parkland finish. Yet in Stableford's unforgiving calculus of disasters, his 10 zero-point holes kept Baker's challenge alive deep into Sunday. Only when Baker imploded spectacularly down the Bletchingley stretch, haemorrhaging points through a catastrophic six-hole spell, did Mullin finally seize both crowns.

Gregg Williams collected his first Wooden Spoon after back-to-back third and fourth-place finishes in the previous tournaments, finishing 27 points behind in Trophy terms and 71 strokes adrift in the Jacket. The 360 holes of competition produced just seven birdies and 62 zero-point disasters, testament to the brutal examination posed by Sussex and Surrey's finest layouts.

## Round 1: Five-Way Chaos at Royal Ashdown

Ashdown Forest's bunkerless heathland terrain delivered immediate carnage. Baker emerged with a four-point Trophy lead after 35 points, whilst Mullin's 23-over-par gross secured the Jacket by three strokes. But the margins masked the chaos beneath.

Williams opened with a triple-bogey seven at the first, immediately hitting bottom in the Spoon battle. Baker answered with his own triple at the second. By the fourth hole, Williams had surrendered an early Trophy lead with an eight, only to snatch it back with a birdie at the eighth. Then came the 11th hole horror show. Henry Meller carded a catastrophic 12 on the Par 3, whilst Stuart Neumann imploded to a seven. Williams added a six for a single point. Three consecutive disasters, three Trophy challenges shattered.

Baker's route to the top proved equally tortuous. A quintuple-bogey nine at the 14th left him bleeding zero points before a par at the 15th restored his lead. Mullin's gross consistency carried him through the wreckage, his birdie at the 13th establishing Jacket control despite his own seven at the 14th. By day's end, disaster holes littered every scorecard, setting the tone for a tournament where simply avoiding zeros proved decisive.

## Round 2: Meller's Masterclass Forces Tie

Henry Meller produced the tournament's finest round at Lingfield Park, his 36 points and 20-over-par effort forcing a Trophy deadlock with Mullin atop the cumulative standings at 64 points apiece. Mullin extended his Jacket dominance to 45 strokes clear despite surrendering the Trophy lead twice during the round.

Baker opened with a birdie at the third to maintain pressure, but Williams and Meller both carded disasters on the same hole, eights and nines bleeding crucial points. Neumann hit bottom in the Spoon battle with back-to-back disasters at the first and second. Mullin seized the Trophy lead at the 11th before surrendering it a hole later, then reclaimed it with a par at the 14th as Baker triple-bogeyed. Baker's quintuple-bogey nine at the 17th looked terminal, but Mullin answered with his own disaster at the closing Par 5, handing Meller the lead with a closing bogey.

The standings compressed behind the co-leaders. Williams recovered from his early implosion to post 31 points through a stronger back nine. Baker's 28 points dropped him to joint fourth alongside Neumann. Five players separated by just eight Trophy points heading to Crowborough, whilst Mullin's gross stranglehold looked unassailable.

## Round 3: Baker Reclaims Control by Single Point

Jon Baker's 39-point surge at Crowborough Beacon restored his Trophy advantage by the slenderest margin, leading Mullin by a single point at 103-102. Mullin's 17-over-par round extended his Jacket cushion to 16 strokes. The MacKenzie-designed heathland tested everyone's resilience.

Meller opened with a triple bogey, immediately surrendering his share of the lead. Mullin briefly seized control at the Par 5 tenth before Baker reclaimed it a hole later. Williams endured three consecutive disasters across holes two, four and five, averaging close to 3-over per hole for a six-hole stretch that buried his challenge. The 10th hole delivered synchronised misery: Meller, Baker and Neumann all carded eights for zero points whilst Williams salvaged four. Mullin's five for three points gave him temporary control.

Then came the 15th, where every player imploded simultaneously. Williams, Meller, Baker and Neumann all scored zeros in a collective surrender to Crowborough's demands. The closing hole saw four more disasters, including Mullin's seven ending his hopes of carrying a Trophy lead into the final round. Baker's single-point cushion set up Sunday's showdown, with Meller third on 87 points and Williams languishing in fourth on 87 points, his Spoon status looking increasingly secure.

## Round 4: Mullin Pounces as Baker Implodes

David Mullin's 36-point finale secured the Trophy at the 14th hole, where Baker's triple bogey surrendered a lead held since the second round. Mullin's wire-to-wire Jacket dominance concluded with a 19-stroke margin over Neumann, capping a performance of clinical gross control.

Baker produced the tournament's second eagle, a two at the Par 4 eighth that briefly steadied his wobbling challenge. But the wheels came off catastrophically across a six-hole stretch from the ninth. Triple bogeys at the 10th and 11th, a sextuple at the 12th, then back-to-back disasters at the 14th and 15th. Twelve over par for holes 10-15, bleeding points with every swing. Mullin's steady par golf through the same stretch sealed the outcome.

Williams' Spoon was confirmed with authority, his 23-point round including seven disasters across 18 holes. Averaging close to 3-over per hole for the back nine, his 43-over-par effort represented the tournament's worst individual round. Meller climbed to third with 34 points, overtaking Baker in the final standings despite Baker's second-place Trophy finish.

Baker's closing 32 points proved insufficient. His eagle at the eighth couldn't mask the collapse that followed, his 14-point advantage on the front nine evaporating into a nine-point back nine. Mullin maintained his composure throughout, his disaster at the seventh representing his only blemish on a round that delivered both trophies.

**Stableford:** DM 138 | JB 135 | HM 121 | SN 120 | GW 110  
**Gross:** DM +81 | SN +100 | HM +107 | JB +113 | GW +152

## Tournament Recap

David Mullin's double triumph arrived via contrasting routes: relentless gross excellence undermined by Stableford fragility. His 81-over-par total led the Jacket for 64 of 72 holes, losing control only briefly when Baker's early charge threatened. Yet in Trophy terms, Mullin spent 57 holes chasing, his 10 zero-point disasters keeping the door ajar for Baker's challenge.

Baker's collapse ranks among the tournament's most dramatic. Leading the Trophy wire-to-wire through 54 holes, his final-round implosion across six catastrophic holes gifted Mullin the sweep. The eagle at the eighth hinted at resilience, but 12 over par from the ninth to the 15th sealed his fate. His 11 zero-point holes across four rounds told the story of a player undone by disasters rather than sustained mediocrity.

Williams earned his inaugural Spoon through relentless consistency of a different kind, his 14 disasters and 110 Trophy points representing the tournament's nadir. Finishing 27 points and 71 strokes behind, his challenge never materialised after Round 1's early promise evaporated. Meller's 36-point Round 2 masterclass represented the week's high point, though his catastrophic 12 at Ashdown's 11th and subsequent volatility prevented a sustained challenge.

The Sussex-Surrey swing delivered brutal golf, its seven total birdies and 62 disasters testament to courses that tested skill and temperament equally. Mullin navigated the chaos best, his gross mastery ultimately overwhelming his Stableford vulnerability when Baker's challenge dissolved in spectacular fashion.

**Jon Baker (2nd Trophy, 4th Jacket):** Led the Trophy through 54 holes before a catastrophic final-round meltdown surrendered both control and victory. His eagle at the eighth in Round 4, one of only two in tournament history to this point, couldn't prevent the 12-over-par implosion from holes 10-15 that gifted Mullin the sweep.
