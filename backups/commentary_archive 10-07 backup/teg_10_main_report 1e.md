## Tournament Summary

Alex Baker secured his maiden Trophy with a commanding wire-to-wire performance across Portugal's Algarve coast, posting 184 points to finish 11 clear of Gregg Williams. The victory marked redemption after years haunted by Wooden Spoon finishes, as Baker led 33 of the final 51 holes following a decisive move in Round 1.

David Mullin dominated the Gross competition with equal authority, leading all 72 holes en route to his ninth Green Jacket by a 12-stroke margin. Yet his Stableford volatility—ranging from Round 1's tournament-best 49 points to Round 3's collapse to 31—left him third in the Trophy race, 22 points adrift of Baker.

Williams provided the week's principal drama. Tied with Baker entering the final round, he briefly seized the lead at the fifth hole before disaster struck. A quadruple-bogey seven at the sixth hole effectively ended his challenge, though twin 40-point finishes from Mullin, Williams and Jon Baker ensured an entertaining climax. John Patterson's historic implosion—20 high-scoring holes including three quintuple-bogeys or worse—consigned him to the tournament's worst-ever performance.

## Round 1: Mullin's Explosive Opening

David Mullin seized control at Boavista with a devastating 49-point display, establishing an eight-point cushion over Alex Baker. His afternoon surge featured three birdies across six holes—at the 13th and 14th consecutively, then the 16th—as he posted a near-flawless +4 gross to claim both early leads.

Baker overcame disasters at the second and eighth holes to salvage 41 points, whilst Williams' round imploded spectacularly at the finish. An octuple-bogey eight at the 16th cost him three points, then came a nonuple-bogey nine at the 18th. Stuart Neumann endured similar late torture, posting back-to-back disasters at 17 and 18, including a dectuple-bogey 10 at the last.

Jon Baker's steady 37 points kept him within striking distance of the Jacket lead, trailing Mullin by 14 strokes. Patterson's early struggles—quintuple-bogeys at the sixth and eighth—set an ominous tone for the week ahead.

## Round 2: Mullin Maintains Authority

Mullin consolidated his Trophy lead at Palmares' Praia-Alvor combination, posting 42 points to hold a five-point advantage over the now-tied Baker and Williams. Jon Baker surged to within one stroke of the Jacket lead after a tournament-best +10 gross round, his birdie at the second igniting a composed front-nine performance.

Williams mounted the day's strongest Stableford challenge with 48 points, his birdie at the 10th anchoring a mid-round stretch of 12 points across three holes. Baker's 45 points matched Jon Baker's total, though his front-nine excellence—28 points—couldn't prevent late-round wobbles at 16 and 18 costing crucial ground.

Neumann's catastrophic middle section derailed his round entirely. Three consecutive zeroes from holes 13-15—including back-to-back quintuple-bogeys—preceded a sextuple-bogey 10 at the 18th. Patterson opened with a hexatuple-bogey 10 at the first, then added disasters at 10, 11 and 13, his 35 points offering scant consolation.

**Trophy Standings:** DM 91 | AB 86 | GW 86 | JB 82 | SN 69 | JP 64  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +15 | JB +28 | GW +39 | AB +51 | JP +56 | SN +69

## Round 3: Trophy Race Explodes into Chaos

The lead changed hands five times across a tumultuous Palmares round as Alex Baker and Gregg Williams emerged tied atop the standings at 133 points. Baker seized control at the fourth with a four-pointer after Mullin's quintuple-bogey eight, then reclaimed it at the sixth following his own disaster at the 13th.

Mullin's Stableford capitulation—six disasters including zeroes at 9, 11 and 13—saw him plummet to fifth with 31 points despite extending his Jacket lead to five strokes. Late birdies at 15 and 17 couldn't mask the damage. Jon Baker's 35 points kept him within 16 points of the Trophy lead, whilst Stuart Neumann's recovery to third suggested resilience after Round 2's horrors.

Patterson's nightmare deepened. Quintuple-bogey disasters at the eighth and 12th were part of a seven-hole stretch from 10-16 yielding just four points. His 27 points marked a new personal worst, leaving him 64 points off the Trophy pace and firmly anchored to the Wooden Spoon.

## Round 4: Baker Breaks Clear at Boavista

Alex Baker seized his maiden Trophy with a record-equalling 51-point masterclass, breaking clear of Gregg Williams after the sixth hole and never looking back. Williams briefly reclaimed the lead with a birdie at the fifth, but his quadruple-bogey seven at the sixth—scoring zero points—proved terminal. Baker's response was emphatic: four-pointers at both the sixth and seventh holes, then another at the 10th, building an unassailable cushion.

Three players tied for second-place honours in the round with 40 points. Mullin cruised home with a birdie at the 16th to secure his ninth Jacket by 12 strokes. Jon Baker and Williams matched that 40-point tally, the latter's own disaster at the 18th—an octuple-bogey eight—a cruel punctuation to his week. Neumann's 39 points featured four-point hauls at the 7th, 10th and 14th.

Patterson's historic collapse reached its nadir. Disasters at 7, 8 and 10—the latter a hexatuple-bogey 11—were bookended by zeroes at 17 and 18, the final one a nonuple-bogey nine. His 21 points and +40 gross left him 72 points behind Baker, the largest Trophy margin in tournament history.

**Trophy Standings:** AB 184 | GW 173 | DM 162 | JB 157 | SN 144 | JP 112  
**Green Jacket Standings:** DM +51 | JB +63 | GW +76 | AB +90 | SN +125 | JP +132

## Tournament Recap

Alex Baker's first Trophy arrived via the most emphatic wire-to-wire performance of his career. Leading 33 of the final 51 holes after seizing control during Round 1, his 11-point margin over Gregg Williams marked the culmination of four rounds never finishing lower than second. The victory exorcised years of Wooden Spoon nightmares—his most recent coming just 12 months earlier at TEG 9.

Williams' challenge fell agonisingly short. Tied entering the final round, his quadruple-bogey zero at the sixth hole on Sunday proved insurmountable despite posting twin 40-point efforts over the weekend. His 173-point total represented his strongest finish yet fell short when it mattered most.

David Mullin's ninth Green Jacket—won by 12 strokes after leading all 72 holes—underscored his Gross superiority. Yet his Stableford inconsistency told a different story: his Round 1 high of 49 points crashed to 31 in Round 3, leaving him third in the Trophy race despite dominating stroke play throughout. The split perfectly illustrated format paradoxes at the tournament's heart.

Jon Baker's steady 157 points secured fourth place, whilst Stuart Neumann's recovery from Round 2's triple-quintuple disaster merited recognition. But the week belonged to two extremes: Baker's maiden triumph and John Patterson's historic collapse. Twenty disasters—including quintuple-bogeys or worse at the eighth, 12th and eighth holes again—left Patterson 72 points adrift, claiming his first Wooden Spoon by a margin reflecting the tournament's most catastrophic individual performance.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**Alex Baker (1st):** Maiden Trophy winner with wire-to-wire dominance, leading 33 of 72 holes after seizing control in Round 1. His 51-point final round equalled the all-time TEG record and confirmed a victory built on consistency—never finishing worse than second in any round. The 184-point total and 11-point margin marked redemption after years haunted by Wooden Spoon finishes.

**Gregg Williams (2nd):** Tantalizingly close but ultimately second, Williams tied the lead after Round 3 and briefly reclaimed it at the fifth hole on Sunday. His quadruple-bogey zero at the sixth proved terminal, though twin 40-point weekend rounds demonstrated resilience. The 173-point total represented his best-ever Trophy finish, falling just short when the prize glittered brightest.

**David Mullin (3rd):** Ninth Green Jacket secured with comprehensive 12-stroke dominance, leading all 72 holes in Gross. Yet Stableford volatility left him third in the Trophy race—his Round 3 collapse to 31 points costing dearly despite opening with a tournament-best 49. Three birdies across six holes in Round 1 showcased his quality, but format inconsistency prevented double glory.

**Jon Baker (4th):** Steady progression marked by Round 2's tournament-best +10 gross, closing to within one stroke of the Jacket lead. Ultimately finished 27 points off the Trophy pace and 12 strokes behind in Gross. His consistency kept him in contention through three rounds before a 40-point final day confirmed fourth place.

**Stuart Neumann (5th):** Survived Round 2's catastrophic middle section—three consecutive quintuple-bogey zeroes from holes 13-15—to finish fifth. His 144 points and 11 disasters reflected resilience rather than excellence, but escaping last place after that nightmare stretch represented a minor triumph of survival.

**John Patterson (6th):** Historic collapse yielded the tournament's worst-ever performance with 112 points and 20 disasters. Three quintuple-bogeys or worse—including hexatuple-bogeys at Round 2's first and Round 4's eighth—left him 72 points adrift. His first Wooden Spoon arrived via margins reflecting unprecedented carnage across 72 holes of Portuguese coastline.
