# Jon Baker's Coronation: A Wire-to-Wire Double Sweep

**Catalonia, Spain • 2018**

Jon Baker claimed his third TEG Trophy and maiden Green Jacket with a performance of ruthless control across Catalonia's championship layouts. Leading the Trophy for 59 of 72 holes and the Jacket for 70, Baker became the first player to sweep both competitions in a single tournament. His six-point Stableford margin over brother Alex understated the dominance, whilst a three-stroke Jacket victory completed the historic double.

Alex Baker's collapse provided the weekend's drama. Leading the Trophy by two entering the final round, he imploded with five triple-bogeys-or-worse across the Stadium Course, his 27-point calamity handing Jon the title at the sixth. David Mullin's paradox defined the bottom: chasing a tenth Jacket finish within three strokes whilst collecting his second Wooden Spoon with 125 points. The field's volatility ran wild throughout—41 disasters scarred the tournament, including Gregg Williams's ten at the 15th in Round 2.

## Round 1: Patterson's Opening Salvo Fades

John Patterson seized the early Trophy lead with four points at the opening hole, his strong front nine building a three-point cushion. But the Stadium Course devoured his back nine. Five consecutive disasters from the tenth through the 17th—including a sextuple at the fourth and a nine at the 13th—haemorrhaged 17 points in eight holes. Patterson's 26-point opening left him fifth, whilst Jon Baker's steady 35 points claimed both leads.

Alex Baker's 32 points placed him second despite disasters at the second, 11th and 13th. Williams endured early carnage—triple-bogeys at the first, second, and fifth, plus another at the 16th—yet salvaged 30 points with a birdie at the 15th. David Mullin's 29 points secured fourth, matching Jon's 18-over gross but trailing in Stableford conversion.

Jon's three-point Trophy advantage and two-stroke Jacket lead established control. Patterson's implosion—eight disasters in 18 holes—set the tone for a tournament marred by volatility. The Stadium Course announced its intentions: no mercy for wayward golf.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 35 | AB 32 | GW 30 | DM 29 | JP 26  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +18 | DM +20 | AB +28 | GW +29 | JP +40

## Round 2: Baker Extends Control on Tour Course

Jon Baker broke the Gross deadlock early, establishing solo Jacket control by the third hole and never relinquishing it. His 12-over-par round tied the PGA Catalunya Tour Course record, stretching his Jacket lead to eight strokes. Birdies at the second bookended by six consecutive pars from the sixth demonstrated the control that would define his week. A late triple-bogey at the 17th cost him Trophy points but left his two-point lead intact.

Alex Baker posted the round's best Stableford performance—42 points—despite a quintuple-bogey nine at the 12th. His back nine consistency (22 points) kept him within striking distance. Williams recovered from his opening disaster with 39 points, including a birdie at the 17th that salvaged a round marred by his ten-stroke catastrophe at the par-five 15th. Mullin's birdie at the tenth anchored his 36-point effort, whilst Patterson's 34 points featured disasters at the fifth, 15th, and 18th.

Baker's wire-to-wire Jacket domination took shape. Leading by eight strokes and controlling the Trophy by two, he had seized command. Behind him, Alex lurked, Williams steadied, and Patterson continued his wild ride. The Tour Course offered no respite from the destruction.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 76 | AB 74 | GW 69 | DM 65 | JP 60  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +30 | DM +33 | AB +48 | GW +49 | JP +71

## Round 3: Alex Baker's Lead Grab at El Prat

Alex Baker snatched the Trophy lead at the 13th, his level-par four earning three points whilst Jon suffered a triple-bogey zero. The brothers had traded control three times in two holes: Alex took it at the opening hole, lost it to disaster at the second, then reclaimed it at the 13th to hold a two-point advantage entering the final round. His 36-point round came despite late-round blobs at the second, fifth, and 18th.

Jon's 32-point performance featured three disasters—at the 12th, 13th, and 15th—but his Jacket control never wavered. Brief challenges from Mullin (who led for three holes from the third) dissolved when Mullin triple-bogeyed the sixth and 11th. Jon's birdie at the ninth kept him within striking distance in the Trophy battle whilst maintaining an eight-stroke Jacket cushion.

John Patterson produced the tournament's finest Stableford round—39 points—surging from last to fourth overall. His consistency (five threes, seven fours) contrasted sharply with his earlier chaos, though a quintuple at the 16th reminded observers of his volatility. Williams ground out 35 points despite disasters at the second and fifth, holding third. Mullin's collapse—29 points with disasters at the sixth, 11th, and 13th—dropped him to last place and into Wooden Spoon territory.

The stage was set: Alex defending a slender two-point Trophy lead, Jon eight strokes clear in the Jacket chase, and Mullin battling to avoid the Spoon whilst chasing Jacket silver.

**Trophy Standings:** AB 110 | JB 108 | GW 104 | JP 99 | DM 94  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +51 | DM +54 | GW +72 | AB +72 | JP +96

## Round 4: Jon Baker's Double Sweep

Jon Baker reclaimed the Trophy lead at the sixth hole and never looked back. Alex Baker's defence crumbled with a triple-bogey zero, the first of four consecutive disasters that destroyed his title hopes. He managed just 27 points—20 under his tournament average—as triple-bogeys at the sixth, ninth, 12th, and 17th bled 15 points. His quintuple at the ninth epitomised the capitulation, finishing six points adrift of Jon.

Baker's 35-point finale sealed his historic double. A quadruple-bogey at the 13th proved his only blemish, his 19-over gross matching Mullin's round score to secure the Jacket by three strokes. The victory completed wire-to-wire Gross domination: 70 of 72 holes led, control seized in Round 2 and never surrendered.

Williams's 32 points—marred by a quintuple at the tenth—secured third place, six points behind Jon but ahead of Patterson's late surge. Patterson's 36-point performance, tournament-best for Round 4, couldn't overcome earlier inconsistency despite matching Jon's Trophy score. His triple-bogey at the 12th remained his lone disaster.

Mullin's nightmare continued: 31 points with a triple-bogey at the 15th sealed his second Wooden Spoon despite finishing second in the Jacket, three strokes behind Baker. His 19-over gross round matched Jon's winning score but his Stableford conversion failed catastrophically, illustrating the format's harsh reality for steady-but-unspectacular golf.

**Trophy Standings:** JB 143 | AB 137 | GW 136 | JP 135 | DM 125  
**Green Jacket Standings:** JB +70 | DM +73 | GW +99 | AB +106 | JP +123

## Tournament Recap

Jon Baker's coronation arrived via the most commanding performance in TEG history. Sweeping both competitions marked unprecedented dominance: his Trophy margin of six points and Jacket victory by three strokes reflected wire-to-wire control that barely flickered. Leading 70 of 72 Jacket holes and 59 of 72 Trophy holes, Baker's only vulnerability emerged in Round 3 when Alex seized a two-point advantage at El Prat's 13th. One day later, that lead evaporated at the sixth hole of the final round as Alex's four-disaster meltdown surrendered the title.

The BAKER brothers' duel provided the tournament's defining subplot. Trading Trophy leads three times across Rounds 3 and 4, their battle peaked when Alex led by two entering Sunday. Jon's takeover at the sixth—Alex triple-bogeying whilst Jon managed a bogey—triggered Alex's collapse. Four disasters in 12 holes produced a 27-point horror show, Jon's historic double secured with surgical efficiency.

David Mullin's paradox completed the narrative arc. Chasing his tenth Green Jacket finish, Mullin closed within three strokes yet collected his second Wooden Spoon with 125 points—18 behind fourth-place Patterson. His steady gross golf (second-best by three strokes) contrasted violently with Stableford futility, only two birdies all week unable to offset conservative bogey golf. The format's cruel irony: Jacket silver paired with Spoon ignominy.

Volatility defined the week. Forty-one disasters scarred the field, Patterson's 21 triple-bogeys-or-worse across 72 holes illustrating the carnage. Williams's ten-stroke catastrophe at Round 2's par-five 15th and Alex's five final-round disasters punctuated a tournament where survival often trumped brilliance. Jon Baker survived best, his three-round course-record-tying 12-over at the Tour Course epitomising controlled excellence amidst chaos. TEG 11 belonged to Baker. Emphatically.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**Jon Baker (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Swept both competitions with wire-to-wire Jacket control (leading 70 of 72 holes) and dominant Trophy performance (led 59 of 72 holes). His Round 2 12-over tied the PGA Catalunya Tour Course record, whilst consistent excellence across all four rounds—never below 32 points—secured his third Trophy and maiden Jacket by comfortable margins.

**Alex Baker (2nd Trophy):** Led Trophy entering final round by two points but collapsed catastrophically with five triple-bogeys-or-worse in Round 4, managing just 27 points. Posted tournament-best Round 2 (42 points) and seized Round 3 lead at 13th, but Sunday's four-disaster sequence from sixth to 12th surrendered title to brother Jon.

**Gregg Williams (3rd Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Steady third-place finisher throughout, posting 32-39 points each round despite eight total disasters including Round 2's ten-stroke calamity at par-five 15th. Consistent back-nine performances (22 points in Round 2, 20 in Round 3) kept him in contention but never threatened leaders.

**John Patterson (4th Trophy, 5th Jacket):** Tournament's most volatile player (standard deviation 6.65 gross), suffered 21 triple-bogeys-or-worse across 72 holes including eight in Round 1 alone. Bookended disaster with brilliance—posted tournament-best Stableford rounds (39 in Round 3, 36 in Round 4) after opening 26-point catastrophe, illustrating extreme inconsistency that defined his week.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 2nd Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Finished Jacket runner-up (+73, three strokes behind Baker) yet collected second career Spoon with lowest Stableford total (125 points). Only player with multiple birdies (two) but conservative bogey golf failed Stableford conversion, his Round 4 disaster at 15th sealing paradoxical double of Jacket silver and Spoon ignominy.
