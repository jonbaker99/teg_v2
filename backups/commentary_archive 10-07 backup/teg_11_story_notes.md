# TEG 11 Story Notes

## Key Points
- Jon BAKER's 3rd Trophy & 1st Green Jacket - swept both competitions with wire-to-wire control in Gross, winning Trophy by 6 points and Jacket by 3 strokes
- Alex BAKER's collapse - led Trophy after Round 3 but imploded with 4 disasters in Round 4 to finish 2nd (-6)
- David MULLIN's 2nd Wooden Spoon despite 10th Green Jacket chase - finished 2nd in Gross (+3) but last in Stableford, posting just 125 points
- Lead changed hands 6 times in Trophy race (most between Alex and Jon BAKER) but never in Gross after Jon seized control Round 2
- Extreme volatility - four players posted rounds with 4+ disasters; John PATTERSON had 21 triple-bogeys-or-worse across 72 holes

## How It Unfolded
- **Round 1:** JB 35pts leads Trophy by 3; JB/DM tied +18 lead Gross
- **Round 2:** JB extends Trophy lead to 2; JB breaks Gross tie, leads solo
- **Round 3:** AB takes Trophy lead by 2 at H13; JB maintains Jacket control; JP surges to 39pts (best round)
- **Round 4:** JB retakes Trophy at H6, cruises home; AB's 4-disaster meltdown seals JB's double

## Story Angles
- Jon BAKER's coronation - first to sweep Trophy and Jacket in same TEG, dominated Gross (led 70/72 holes)
- The BAKER brothers' duel - traded Trophy lead 3 times in final two rounds before Jon's Round 4 takeover
- David MULLIN paradox - chased 10th Jacket (finished +3 behind) yet collected Wooden Spoon with lowest Stableford total
- Alex BAKER's Round 4 horror show - 5 triple-bogeys-or-worse destroyed Trophy defense
- John PATTERSON's wild ride - started 26pts, ended 135pts despite posting best Round 4 (36pts) and suffering 21 disasters tournament-wide
- Disaster epidemic - 41 total disasters across field, including Gregg WILLIAMS's 10 on H15 (Par 5) Round 2
