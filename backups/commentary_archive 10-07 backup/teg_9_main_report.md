## Tournament Summary

John Patterson seized the TEG Trophy in his debut appearance with a performance of bewildering contradictions: a historic 49-point eruption followed by wild swings that nearly cost him everything. Leading 53 of 72 holes in the Stableford standings, Patterson eventually prevailed by six points, though not before Alex Baker briefly snatched his crown in the dying holes of the final round.

David Mullin's eighth Green Jacket triumph told a different story entirely. Wire-to-wire dominance in the gross competition masked early-round volatility, including an opening quadruple bogey and a Round 4 quad that might have derailed lesser players. Yet Mullin led all 72 holes bar one, his ten-stroke margin a testament to relentless ball-striking amidst field-wide chaos.

This was golf at its most volatile. Only 11 birdies across the entire tournament, the fewest in TEG history through nine editions. Triple bogeys and worse littered every scorecard. Patterson's Round 2 masterclass tied the tournament record. Baker's late charge provided the drama. Stuart Neumann collected his third career Wooden Spoon despite a spirited final-round fightback. Two competitions, two utterly different champions, one gloriously chaotic week on Portugal's Lisbon Coast.

## Round 1: Opening Salvos at Royal Óbidos

The tournament began in familiar territory. Royal Óbidos, Seve Ballesteros' final design and a Challenge Tour venue, had tested the field twice before. This time, however, the course bared its teeth from the opening tee shot.

Gregg Williams endured a quintuple-bogey start or worse at the first, immediately claiming wooden honours. Alex Baker followed with a four-over disaster at the second, dragging him to the bottom alongside Williams. By the fourth, the tone was set: Stuart Neumann's five-over capitulation left him struggling, whilst debutant Patterson's six-over meltdown saw him surrender an early lead.

Yet Patterson recovered admirably, birdieing the 17th for four points to stay in touch. Jon Baker seized the Stableford lead at the sixth and held firm, posting 39 points to edge David Mullin by a single shot. Mullin, meanwhile, quietly took control of the gross standings despite opening hiccups, finishing at +15 to lead by two strokes over Jon Baker, whose closing quadruple bogey at the 18th proved costly.

At day's end, the leaderboard split cleanly. Jon Baker led Stableford narrowly, Mullin commanded gross comfortably. Patterson sat joint second with Mullin on 38 points, his 14-stroke deficit in gross a clear indicator of contrasting fortunes in the two competitions. Neumann's six-point haul anchored the field, disasters at the 11th, 12th, 15th and 16th destroying any momentum from a solid front nine.

**Round 1 leaderboard:**  
**Stableford:** JB 39 pts; DM 38 pts; JP 38 pts; AB 32 pts; GW 31 pts; SN 23 pts  
**Gross:** DM +15; JB +17; JP +28; GW +35; SN +42; AB +43

## Round 2: Patterson's Historic Eruption

Praia D'El Rey, a spectacular mix of parkland and coastal dunes, witnessed the round that would define the tournament. Patterson's 49 points tied the TEG's all-time single-round record. More significantly, it seized both Stableford and gross leads in one seismic morning.

Jon Baker surrendered his overnight advantage immediately, a triple bogey at the first handing Patterson the initiative. Baker compounded his misery with another triple at the seventh, whilst Patterson birdied the same hole to extend his margin. By the turn, the race was effectively over: Patterson's front nine of 19 points set up a spectacular back-nine surge.

Three consecutive birdies at the seventh, 12th and another at the 17th left Patterson untouchable. He led by ten points in Stableford, a breakaway margin rarely seen in TEG history. Alex Baker climbed to second with a solid 44 points, his best round of the tournament powered by 25 front-nine points. Mullin matched Patterson's gross score of 14 strokes, tying the lead in that competition whilst slipping to third in Stableford.

The damage behind was brutal. Gregg Williams' six-over disaster at the ninth left him floundering. Stuart Neumann managed consecutive disasters at the 11th, 12th and 13th, posting zero points across all three holes. His 30-point haul felt respectable only in comparison to the wreckage around him.

Patterson led by ten. The battle, seemingly, was finished.

**Round 2 scores:**  
JP +14 / 49 pts; AB +27 / 44 pts; DM +14 / 39 pts; JB +19 / 37 pts; GW +28 / 36 pts; SN +32 / 30 pts

**Trophy standings:**  
JP 87 pts; AB 76 pts; JB 76 pts; DM 77 pts; GW 67 pts; SN 53 pts

**Green Jacket standings:**  
DM +29; JB +36; JP +42; GW +63; AB +70; SN +74

## Round 3: Patterson Wobbles, Baker Closes

Royal Óbidos returned for Round 3, and with it came the carnage that had defined the opening day. Patterson's ten-point cushion evaporated as his volatility resurfaced. Triple bogeys at the third and eighth, a quadruple at the 12th and another quad at the 18th reduced him to 34 points, his worst round of the week. Yet somehow, remarkably, he clung to the lead.

Alex Baker posted 42 points to leap from third to second, cutting Patterson's advantage to just three. Jon Baker and Mullin both managed 34 and 33 points respectively, the latter despite a quintuple-bogey nine at the par-four tenth that cost him any Stableford momentum. Baker kept pace in gross, matching Mullin's 22 strokes to stay within touching distance.

The round belonged to Williams, whose 38 points dragged him back into contention for a top-five finish. Neumann also rallied with 37 points, though his disasters at the fourth and 16th ensured he remained anchored at the bottom. Jon Baker's front nine of 22 points promised much, but consecutive zeros at the seventh and 11th derailed any hopes of challenging Patterson.

Patterson led by three. Baker lurked in second. The final round at Praia D'El Rey promised fireworks.

**Round 3 scores:**  
JP +29 / 34 pts; AB +30 / 42 pts; JB +22 / 34 pts; DM +22 / 33 pts; GW +25 / 38 pts; SN +26 / 37 pts

**Trophy standings:**  
JP 121 pts; AB 118 pts; DM 110 pts; JB 110 pts; GW 105 pts; SN 90 pts

**Green Jacket standings:**  
DM +51; JB +58; JP +71; GW +88; AB +100; SN +100

## Round 4: Baker's Brief Glory, Patterson's Triumph

The final round delivered the drama its chaotic predecessor rounds had promised. David Mullin opened with a quadruple bogey at the first, surrendering any Stableford hopes but somehow maintaining his gross lead through sheer consistency elsewhere. Jon Baker birdied the third to solidify his second-place position in the gross standings, whilst Stuart Neumann's triple at the same hole ensured his third career Wooden Spoon was inevitable.

Patterson wobbled early, a quintuple at the fifth cutting his lead to a precarious two points. Alex Baker sensed blood. A birdie at the eighth kickstarted a dominant six-hole stretch. He birdied the 13th for five points, surging past Patterson to claim the Stableford lead for the first time all week.

One hole. That was all Baker enjoyed at the summit. Patterson steadied himself, birdieing the 12th for four points within a crucial back-nine surge. By the 14th, the lead was his again. Baker faded with a five-over disaster at the 15th, his challenge extinguished as quickly as it had ignited.

Patterson posted 47 points, his second-best round of the tournament, to win by six. Baker's 44 points secured a commendable second place, his brief moment at the top a tantalising glimpse of what might have been. Mullin's 38 points and +16 gross wrapped up his eighth Green Jacket with a ten-stroke margin, his wire-to-wire dominance unshaken by early disasters.

Williams and Jon Baker finished tied on 143 and 146 points respectively, Williams' Round 4 sextuple at the seventh typifying the week's volatility. Neumann's 37 points, powered by birdies at the 13th and a strong back nine, offered scant consolation for his third career Spoon.

**Round 4 scores:**  
JP +17 / 47 pts; AB +27 / 44 pts; DM +16 / 38 pts; GW +27 / 38 pts; JB +19 / 36 pts; SN +25 / 37 pts

**Trophy standings:**  
JP 168 pts; AB 162 pts; DM 148 pts; JB 146 pts; GW 143 pts; SN 127 pts

**Green Jacket standings:**  
DM +67; JB +77; JP +88; GW +115; SN +125; AB +127

## Tournament Recap

Two competitions, two utterly different stories. John Patterson's debut Trophy triumph combined brilliance and chaos in equal measure: a record-tying 49 points followed by wild swings that nearly cost him everything. Leading 53 of 72 holes in Stableford, he ultimately prevailed by six points, his Round 4 composure under pressure belying his tournament inexperience.

David Mullin's eighth Green Jacket, by contrast, was a masterclass in relentless ball-striking. Leading all 72 gross holes bar one, his ten-stroke margin papered over early disasters that might have derailed lesser competitors. Only 11 birdies across the entire field marked this as the lowest-scoring tournament in TEG history through nine editions, yet Mullin's consistency amidst field-wide carnage proved decisive.

Alex Baker's late charge provided the drama, his H14 seizure of the Stableford lead a tantalising glimpse before fading. Patterson's 15-point round range (49 to 34) showcased extreme volatility, yet he never truly relinquished control. Stuart Neumann's third career Wooden Spoon, despite improved finishing form, underlined a week to forget.

In the end, Patterson's perfect storm claimed the Trophy. Mullin's quiet dominance secured the Jacket. Portugal's Lisbon Coast witnessed two champions worthy of their crowns, each for entirely different reasons.
