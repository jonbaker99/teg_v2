# TEG 13: Baker's Wire-to-Wire Masterclass in Kent

## Tournament Summary

Jon Baker claimed his fourth TEG Trophy and third Green Jacket with a display of controlled dominance that left the field chasing shadows across Kent's finest links. Leading after every single round in both competitions, Baker's 158-point Stableford haul and +50 gross total represented the tournament's most comprehensive wire-to-wire victory—he led 70 of 72 holes in Stableford and all 72 in gross scoring. His six-point cushion over Gregg Williams in the Trophy race tells only half the story; the 18-stroke margin in the Green Jacket speaks to sustained excellence across four demanding coastal layouts.

Yet this was no procession. Williams mounted a spirited challenge throughout, briefly snatching the Stableford lead at the 15th hole in Round 2 before Baker's immediate birdie response extinguished the rebellion. That fleeting moment—just five holes of leadership across the entire tournament—proved the only blemish on Baker's otherwise flawless command. Williams, finishing runner-up in both competitions (152 points, +68), provided relentless pressure without ever truly threatening the throne.

The tournament's most compelling subplot belonged to John Patterson, whose roller-coaster ride from Canterbury to the coast featured the week's best round (49 points in Round 3) alongside its worst gross performance (96 strokes in Round 1). Patterson's volatility manifested most dramatically in Round 4, where an eagle on the 2nd was immediately followed by triple bogey on the 3rd—a microcosm of his 21-point scoring range across the week. Despite finishing tied third with Alex Baker on 141 points, Patterson trailed by a staggering 47 strokes in gross terms, a paradox that captures the fundamental difference between inspired Stableford scrambling and consistent ball-striking.

David Mullin's fourth Wooden Spoon tells its own bittersweet tale: third place in the Green Jacket at +80, fifth in the Trophy at 135 points. His quintuple bogey on the 10th in Round 4 sealed the Spoon even as his gross game remained respectable—a reminder that in handicapped competitions, spectacular disasters often matter more than steady mediocrity. Meanwhile, Alex Baker's tournament never recovered from a disastrous opening round, though his 44-point finale (tied for the week's best round) suggested what might have been had Kent's coastal winds blown more kindly on day one.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Baker Seizes Control at Royal Cinque Ports

Royal Cinque Ports, hosting its first TEG round, presented a stern examination in wind and links guile. Jon Baker emerged from the opening salvo with a commanding six-point lead, establishing dominance that would prove unshakeable despite the drama unfolding behind him. His 39-point haul and +13 gross score set the tone: efficient, controlled, rarely spectacular but relentlessly effective. The birdie on the 3rd hole gave him a lead in both competitions he would never relinquish—70 holes of chasing awaited the rest of the field.

The chaos behind Baker told a more colourful story. Gregg Williams endured a nightmare start with disasters on the 2nd and 3rd holes, stumbling to just five points over his opening six-hole stretch. Yet the battler in Williams emerged on the back nine, where 21 points (including a crucial birdie at the 15th) salvaged second place at 33 points. His front-nine struggles—just 12 points—illustrated the margin for error when Baker plays at this level.

John Patterson's round became a case study in dramatic oscillation. A birdie on the 5th (5 points total) vaulted him to second place, suggesting a genuine challenge might materialise. Two holes later, a quintuple bogey on the 7th plunged him back to fifth, derailing any momentum. His subsequent disasters on the 10th compounded the damage—six points across holes 6-11 left him with a 28-point total and a 36-stroke gross round that set an ominous baseline for the week ahead.

Alex Baker's first round also foundered in the middle stretch, where disasters on the 11th and 12th yielded just a single point across holes 10-12. His gross scoring suffered particularly badly, averaging +3.00 over holes 10-12 as the coastal winds exposed technical vulnerabilities. David McLachlan matched Williams' 33 points to share second on gross at +22, but Baker's six-point cushion and nine-stroke advantage already felt substantial.

**Round 1 standings:** JB 39pts/+13; GW 33pts/+22; AB 31pts/+30; DM 31pts/+22; JP 28pts/+36

### Round 2: The One-Hole Uprising at Prince's

Prince's Dunes/Himalayas combination provided the week's most dramatic narrative twist—one that lasted precisely five holes before normal service resumed. Coming into Round 2, Williams trailed by six points but carried the momentum of a strong back-nine finish from Royal Cinque Ports. His surge from holes 11-16 (18 points, including a crucial four-pointer on the 15th) sliced through Baker's advantage like a hot knife. At the 15th green, Williams held the Stableford lead outright for the first time in the tournament.

The uprising lasted until Baker stepped onto the 16th tee. Trailing by a single point with three holes remaining, Baker produced the week's defining moment: a birdie on the 18th (4 points) that reclaimed the lead and re-established his authority. Williams' brief flirtation with the top spot—just five holes across 144 total—would prove his only taste of leadership all week. Baker's immediate response demonstrated the champion's instinct: when threatened, strike back harder.

Elsewhere, carnage reigned. John Patterson opened with back-to-back disasters—quadruple bogey on the 1st, triple bogey on the 3rd—before adding three more zeros on the 14th, 17th, and 18th. His five-point haul over the closing six holes meant 28 points for the round, matching his opening effort and dropping him further adrift. The gross damage (96 strokes, +33) painted an even grimmer picture, with an average of +2.67 over holes 13-18 closing a dismal day.

Alex Baker's disaster on the 10th (triple bogey, 0 points) disrupted what had been a promising start—21 points on the front nine suggested recovery from Round 1's struggles. But 13 points on the back nine meant 34 points total, not enough to climb from fourth place. David Mullin's 37 points elevated him to third overall, his strong back-nine pattern (21 points versus 16 on the front) exploiting Prince's layout effectively. Baker's lead had been challenged, briefly lost, and immediately reclaimed—but the gap had shrunk from six points to just one.

**Round 2 standings:** JB 75pts/+29; GW 74pts/+36; DM 68pts/+39; AB 65pts/+57; JP 56pts/+69

### Round 3: Patterson's 49-Point Explosion at Littlestone

Littlestone unveiled the tournament's most extraordinary individual performance: John Patterson's 49-point rampage, the highest round score in his 19-tournament TEG career and one of only two times he'd breached 40 points. The round featured everything Patterson-esque—a birdie on the 4th (5 points), four-pointers on the 2nd, 10th, and 16th, and for good measure, a quadruple bogey on the 17th (0 points). His gross score of 89 (+12) represented his best 18-hole performance in TEG history. The 21-point swing from his previous worst (28 points) captured his essence: volatile, unpredictable, capable of brilliance and disaster within the same round.

Jon Baker responded to Williams' Round 2 challenge with his own statement round: 44 points and +8 gross extended his Stableford lead back to five points while stretching the gross margin to a commanding 30 strokes. His hot spell from holes 6-11 (18 points, capped by a birdie on the 9th) demonstrated the relentless accumulation that defines his game. Never spectacular in the Patterson sense, Baker's consistency across the round—no cold spells, steady pressure—ground down the opposition.

Gregg Williams' 40 points kept him in touch at second place, but the gap had widened from one point to five, and the gross deficit had ballooned from seven strokes to 21. His opening to the round proved costly: Williams briefly held the Stableford lead on the 1st hole before disasters on the 2nd and 3rd (two triple bogeys, both zeros) handed control back to Baker. The pattern was familiar—Williams fighting back gamely but unable to sustain pressure when Baker elevated his game.

Alex Baker's round disintegrated with disasters on the 2nd (quadruple bogey), 8th (triple bogey), 12th (triple bogey), and 18th (triple bogey). The carnage yielded 32 points and dropped him from fourth to fifth overall, now 27 points behind Jon Baker with just one round remaining. David Mullin's matching 32 points (featuring his own disaster, a triple bogey on the 14th) meant he dropped from third to fourth. Patterson's heroics vaulted him from fifth to third overall, though still 24 points behind the leader.

**Round 3 standings:** JB 119pts/+21; GW 114pts/+51; JP 105pts/+81; DM 100pts/+60; AB 97pts/+86

### Round 4: Baker's Closing Statement at Prince's Shore/Dunes

Prince's Shore/Dunes combination provided the final stage for Jon Baker's coronation, though not without a late wobble. Coming into the finale with a five-point cushion, Baker produced another 39-point round to match his tournament-opening score—bookending dominance that left no doubt about the deserving champion. His +13 gross remained the week's lowest round, extending his Green Jacket margin back to 18 strokes after it had swelled to 30 in Round 3. The triple bogey on the 10th represented a rare blemish, but a birdie on the 17th (4 points) ensured the closing act retained its polish.

Gregg Williams' 38 points kept him honest in second place, though the six-point final margin understated Baker's control—Williams had led for just five holes all week. His back-nine pattern reasserted itself (22 points versus 16 on the front), but the early disaster on the 6th (triple bogey, 0 points) meant playing catch-up yet again. The 17-stroke gross deficit in the Green Jacket told its own story: Williams had competed admirably but never truly threatened.

Alex Baker produced the day's equal-best Stableford round (44 points) to salvage pride and climb back to joint third overall. His four-pointer on the 10th proved pivotal—it lifted him off the bottom of the leaderboard just as David Mullin imploded. The +17 gross represented his best round of the week, suggesting he'd finally decoded the Kent coastal conditions just as the tournament ended.

Mullin's quintuple bogey on the 10th sealed his fourth Wooden Spoon in the cruelest fashion. Leading the Spoon battle, he needed merely to avoid catastrophe—instead, he delivered it. The disaster on the 10th, averaging +2.67 over holes 8-10, meant 35 points for the round and 135 for the tournament. The paradox stung: third place in the Green Jacket at +80, yet fifth in the Trophy and proud owner of the Spoon. Steady gross golf proved insufficient when Stableford disasters accumulated.

John Patterson's finale encapsulated his entire week: an eagle on the 2nd (5 points) followed immediately by triple bogey on the 3rd (0 points). Three more zeros (triple bogeys on the 12th and quadruple bogey on the 15th) meant 36 points and +25 gross, dropping him into a tie with Alex Baker at 141 points for third place. The 47-stroke gap between them in gross terms (Patterson +106, Alex Baker +103) revealed the gulf between inspired scrambling and consistent striking. Patterson's 21-point scoring range across rounds remained the tournament's defining statistical oddity.

**Final standings:** JB 158pts/+50; GW 152pts/+68; AB 141pts/+103; JP 141pts/+106; DM 135pts/+80

## Tournament Recap

Jon Baker's fourth TEG Trophy and third Green Jacket sweep represented dominance of the highest order—a wire-to-wire march across four of Kent's finest links courses that brooked no serious challenge. Leading 70 of 72 Stableford holes and all 72 gross holes, Baker turned what promised to be competitive golf into a procession. Gregg Williams' one-hole Stableford lead in Round 2 proved the only blip, extinguished within three holes by Baker's ruthless birdie response. The six-point Trophy margin and 18-stroke Green Jacket cushion told their own stories of sustained excellence against a field that simply couldn't match his consistency.

The supporting cast provided the drama. John Patterson's 49-point explosion at Littlestone (his career best) sitting alongside his 96-stroke opening disaster created a 21-point scoring range that captured his volatile essence. Eagle and triple bogey in consecutive holes during Round 4 merely confirmed what we already knew: Patterson plays golf like a man wrestling a wild animal, occasionally winning the fight spectacularly before being mauled moments later. His tie with Alex Baker for third place masked a 47-stroke gross chasm—the week's most telling statistic about the difference between inspired scrambling and ball-striking quality.

David Mullin's fourth Wooden Spoon will haunt him: third in the Green Jacket, yet fifth in the Trophy after that quintuple bogey on Prince's 10th hole in Round 4 sealed his fate. The Spoon represents Kent's lasting gift—a reminder that in Stableford golf, one catastrophic hole outweighs a week of respectable striking. Baker, meanwhile, heads home with his double haul, his status as TEG's premier player reinforced by a performance that made championship golf look like a casual Sunday stroll. Kent tested them all; only Baker passed with distinction.
