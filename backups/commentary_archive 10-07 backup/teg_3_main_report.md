# Baker's Wire-to-Wire Masterclass Splits Trophy and Jacket

**Algarve, Portugal • 2010**

Jon Baker claimed his maiden TEG Trophy with a performance of rare authority, leading all seventy-two holes to win by seventeen points. This was wire-to-wire dominance of the purest kind. He held the Stableford lead from the first hole of Round 1 until the final putt dropped on Sunday. No challenge materialised, no wobble threatened. Baker simply imposed himself on Boavista and never let go.

Yet this tournament delivered the format's peculiar magic. David Mullin collected his second Green Jacket with a twelve-stroke gross victory despite finishing runner-up in the Stableford. Mullin led the gross scoring for sixty-nine of seventy-two holes, a model of consistency that never translated into Trophy contention. The split champions told the story: volatility conquered steadiness in Stableford, whilst Mullin's controlled excellence ruled the gross leaderboard. Most remarkably, Stuart Newman finished second in gross but fifth in Trophy points, twenty-nine adrift of Baker. The handicapped format delivered its verdict without sentiment.

This was a tournament defined by contrasts and catastrophes. Fifty-eight zero-point holes scarred the field across four rounds. Gregg Williams suffered eleven blanks alone, including a sextuple at the 17th in Round 4. Henry Meller authored an octuple bogey in Round 1 before reeling off consecutive birdies at the 11th and 12th in Round 3. Disaster lurked everywhere, but Baker navigated the chaos with the calm of a man who understood his handicap edge. His breakaway began at eight points and expanded methodically: eleven after two rounds, sixteen after three, seventeen at the finish. No drama required.

## Round 1: Baker Seizes Control From the Start

Jon Baker took the lead at the very first hole and never surrendered it. By the time the opening round concluded, he held an eight-point cushion over David Mullin. The margin was emphatic. The authority unmistakable.

Baker's 45 points established immediate dominance despite posting 19 strokes, two behind Mullin's course-leading 17. The Stableford arithmetic favoured him from the outset. Mullin's consistency counted for less when Baker could absorb disasters and still accumulate points. Both men suffered triple bogeys on the front nine, but Baker's scoring rhythm held firm. He posted points on fourteen holes. Mullin managed thirteen.

The round was punctuated by disasters. Triple bogeys dotted the landscape like warning signs. Baker collected one at the 6th, another at the 10th. Mullin emerged unscathed until late drama. The real carnage belonged to Gregg Williams and Henry Meller. Williams posted a quadruple at the 6th, a triple at the 10th, another quadruple at the 18th. Thirteen points on the back nine told the story of a round unravelling. Meller meanwhile crafted an octuple bogey at the 17th, a twelve on the card, zero points accrued. He had birdied the 16th moments earlier, only to watch his round implode in spectacular fashion.

By the close, Baker sat alone at the summit. Mullin held second despite leading the gross scoring. Henry Meller occupied third with 33 points, Stuart Newman fourth with 32, Williams fifth with 31. The gaps were manageable, but Baker's advantage felt larger than eight points. He had controlled the round from start to finish. The pattern was set.

**Round 1 leaderboard:**
**Stableford:** JB 45 pts; DM 37 pts; HM 33 pts; SN 32 pts; GW 31 pts
**Gross:** DM +17; JB +19; SN +22; HM +28; GW +35

## Round 2: Baker Extends, Meller Surges, Disasters Multiply

Jon Baker stretched his advantage to eleven points by the halfway mark. David Mullin held second but the gap was widening. Baker posted 38 points to Mullin's 35. The mathematics were relentless. Henry Meller matched Baker's 38 but his first-round deficit proved insurmountable. He sat third, twelve points back. The Trophy race was already acquiring the shape of a procession.

Meller's round sparkled in patches. He birdied the 5th and rode a hot spell from the 4th through the 9th, collecting eighteen points across six holes. The front nine yielded 23 points. The back nine delivered fifteen. Strong starters prospered at Boavista, and Meller exploited the early rhythm. Williams also posted a front-nine surge of 21 points before fading to 14 on the inward half. The pattern repeated: fast starts, laboured finishes.

The disasters continued their march. Williams suffered back-to-back blanks at the 10th and 11th, a quadruple followed by a triple. Zero points twice in succession. Stuart Newman collected triple bogeys at the 3rd and 14th, both yielding nothing. He dropped from fourth to fifth. Mullin, serene for most of the round, posted a quintuple at the 17th. Zero points. The consistency that defined his gross scoring couldn't shield him from Stableford brutality.

Baker, meanwhile, absorbed the chaos and kept accumulating. Twenty-six strokes suggested vulnerability, but his 38 points told a different story. He led by eight entering the round. He left leading by eleven. Mullin trailed at 72 points to Baker's 83. Meller sat twelve back. Williams climbed to fourth with 66, Newman fell to fifth with 65. The tournament was drifting into Baker's control.

**Round 2 scores:**
JB +26 / 38 pts; DM +21 / 35 pts; HM +18 / 38 pts; GW +31 / 35 pts; SN +21 / 33 pts

## Round 3: Baker's Breakaway Complete Despite Final-Hole Quintuple

Jon Baker extended his lead to sixteen points with a second consecutive 45-point performance. The Trophy was his to lose. David Mullin posted 40 points and 14 strokes to maintain second place, but the gap had stretched beyond recovery. Gregg Williams surged to third with 41 points, his best round of the tournament. The race for positions shuffled, but Baker sat alone at the summit, unreachable.

The round began in chaos. Baker posted a triple bogey at the 2nd, zero points. Meller suffered disasters at the 1st and 3rd, another blank at the 6th. Williams recorded a quadruple at the 2nd and hit bottom of the leaderboard. Newman blanked at the 9th. The carnage was universal. Baker, however, recovered with ruthless efficiency. He strung together eighteen points from the 6th through the 12th, including four-pointers at the 7th and 10th. The middle section of the round belonged to him entirely.

Meller's round told two stories. He stumbled through the front nine with thirteen points, disasters accumulating at the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 10th. Then he birdied the 11th. And the 12th. Back-to-back birdies, four points apiece, eight points in two holes. The back nine yielded twenty points total. Too late to challenge, but enough to stabilise fourth place. Williams, meanwhile, authored his finest round. Forty-one points lifted him from fourth to third, though he remained twenty-one behind Baker.

Baker's round ended in spectacular fashion. He posted a quintuple bogey at the 18th, zero points, a reminder that disaster stalked everyone. It scarcely mattered. His 45 points matched his opening round. His lead was sixteen. Mullin's 40 points kept him clear in second, but the Trophy was decided. The only question left was the final margin.

**Round 3 scores:**
JB +21 / 45 pts; DM +14 / 40 pts; GW +26 / 41 pts; SN +18 / 36 pts; HM +26 / 33 pts

**Trophy standings:**
JB 128 pts; DM 112 pts; GW 107 pts; HM 104 pts; SN 101 pts

**Green Jacket standings:**
DM +52; JB +66; SN +61; HM +72; GW +92

## Round 4: Baker Coasts Home, Mullin Secures Gross Dominance

Jon Baker posted 36 points and twenty-eight strokes to complete his wire-to-wire triumph. Seventeen points clear of David Mullin at the finish. Seventy-two holes led from the front. No drama required in the closing act. Mullin's 35 points and twenty strokes confirmed his Green Jacket by twelve strokes over Stuart Newman. Split champions, each dominant in their domain.

The final round delivered one last cascade of disasters. Baker opened with a triple bogey, zero points. Newman matched him. Williams blanked at the 3rd. Mullin at the 5th. Meller at the 7th. Baker again at the 10th and 11th, consecutive triple bogeys yielding one point total. Williams posted four blanks across the round. Newman crafted a sextuple at the 17th, ten strokes, zero points, moments after escaping the Wooden Spoon with a birdie at the 16th. The tournament ended as it began: carnage everywhere, survivors claiming glory.

Baker's victory was never threatened. His 36 points left him at 164 for the tournament, comfortably clear of Mullin's 147. The consistency couldn't match the volatility. Mullin's worst Stableford round was 35 points, his best 40. A five-point range. Baker's ranged from 36 to 45. Nine points of variation. Yet Baker won by seventeen. The handicap format delivered its verdict: controlled aggression trumped steady accumulation.

Newman finished second in gross at 84, twelve behind Mullin's 72. In Stableford, he claimed fifth with 135 points, twenty-nine behind Baker. The disconnect was absolute. Meller's 137 points placed him fourth in Trophy, whilst Williams' 138 secured third. The Wooden Spoon belonged to Newman despite his superior gross performance. The format's logic held firm. Consistency in gross scoring meant nothing without Stableford firepower.

Baker's maiden Trophy was complete. Wire-to-wire. Seventy-two holes in control. Seventeen points clear. Untroubled from first tee to final green. Mullin collected his second Green Jacket with twelve-stroke authority. Two champions, two competitions, zero overlap in their dominance. The format delivered exactly what it promised: chaos, contrast, and clarity.

**Round 4 scores:**
JB +28 / 36 pts; DM +20 / 35 pts; SN +23 / 34 pts; HM +24 / 33 pts; GW +35 / 31 pts

**Trophy standings:**
JB 164 pts; DM 147 pts; GW 138 pts; HM 137 pts; SN 135 pts

**Green Jacket standings:**
DM +72; SN +84; JB +94; HM +96; GW +127

## Tournament Recap

Jon Baker's wire-to-wire dominance defined TEG 3. He led every Stableford hole of the tournament, never relinquishing control from the moment he took the lead at the opening hole. His seventeen-point victory margin told only part of the story. The progression was methodical: eight points after Round 1, eleven after Round 2, sixteen after Round 3, seventeen at the finish. No challenger mounted a serious threat. No wobble materialised. Baker simply understood the format better than anyone and exploited his advantage with ruthless efficiency.

David Mullin's second Green Jacket was equally authoritative. He led the gross scoring for sixty-nine of seventy-two holes, posting the most consistent performance of the tournament. His seven-stroke range in gross scoring (14 to 21) demonstrated control rare in amateur golf. Yet Mullin finished seventeen points behind Baker in Stableford. The paradox was stark: the most consistent player couldn't match the volatility of Baker's scoring. Fifty-eight zero-point holes across the field created an environment where calculated aggression outperformed steady accumulation.

The split champions defined this tournament's identity. Baker won Trophy, Mullin won Jacket. Newman finished second in gross but fifth in Stableford. Williams suffered eleven blanks but still claimed third in Trophy. Meller authored an octuple bogey and consecutive birdies in the same tournament. The contrasts were everywhere. This was Boavista at its chaotic best: disaster-filled, unpredictable, yet somehow delivering clear victors in both competitions. Baker's maiden Trophy was earned through dominance. Mullin's Jacket through consistency. Neither story diminished the other.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**Jon Baker (Winner, TEG Trophy):** Wire-to-wire dominance in the truest sense, leading all seventy-two Stableford holes to claim his first Trophy by seventeen points. Posted 164 points despite 94 strokes over par, with rounds of 45, 38, 45, and 36 demonstrating sustained excellence in the handicapped format. Absorbed multiple disasters including back-to-back triple bogeys in Round 4 yet never surrendered control of the leaderboard.

**David Mullin (Winner, Green Jacket):** Secured his second Green Jacket with a twelve-stroke gross victory, leading sixty-nine of seventy-two holes despite finishing second in Stableford. His consistency was remarkable: worst Stableford round 35 points, best 40, a five-point range that showcased control rare in amateur golf. Posted course-record-threatening rounds of 17 and 14 strokes but couldn't match Baker's handicap-fuelled scoring power.

**Gregg Williams (3rd, TEG Trophy):** Finished third with 138 points despite enduring eleven zero-point holes, the most in the field. His Round 3 surge of 41 points represented his finest performance, climbing from fourth to third in the standings. Suffered multiple quadruple bogeys and a sextuple at the 17th in Round 4, yet demonstrated resilience to maintain a podium position throughout the chaos.

**Henry Meller (4th, TEG Trophy):** Produced the tournament's most dramatic contrasts: an octuple bogey at the 17th in Round 1 followed by consecutive birdies at the 11th and 12th in Round 3. His four birdies led the field, showcasing ball-striking quality undermined by ten zero-point holes. Front-nine strength in Rounds 1 and 2 couldn't prevent a slide from third after Round 2 to fourth at the finish.

**Stuart Newman (Wooden Spoon):** Claimed the Wooden Spoon with 135 points despite finishing second in gross at 84 strokes, twelve behind Mullin. The disconnect between gross and Stableford was total: strong ball-striking yielded consistent gross scores but insufficient handicap exploitation. His sextuple bogey at the 17th in Round 4, moments after a birdie at the 16th, encapsulated a tournament of narrow misses and costly disasters.
