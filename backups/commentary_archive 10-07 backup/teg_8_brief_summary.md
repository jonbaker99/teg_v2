Gregg Williams claimed his second TEG Trophy with wire-to-wire dominance, leading the Stableford competition for 63 of 72 holes and building his advantage to 12 points over Alex Baker. David Mullin seized his seventh Green Jacket—tying the all-time record—with a six-stroke gross victory over Jon Baker, matching Williams's 63-hole control but in the separate gross competition. The dual-leader narrative defined Portugal's Lisbon Coast return, with Williams banking massive 41-point rounds in R2 and R4 while Mullin sealed his Green Jacket with crucial birdies on holes 13 and 16 in the final round.

Alex Baker authored the tournament's most dramatic surge, storming from distant third to runner-up with a stunning 39-point final round that vaulted him past four competitors in a single day. Jon Baker briefly threatened Mullin's gross lead during Round 3 but faded with early disasters in Round 4, while Henry Meller's nightmarish closing stretch—16 strokes over par with back-to-back disasters on holes 2-5—dropped him from contention. Stuart Neumann endured a forgettable week, collecting 23 disasters across 72 holes to claim his second career Wooden Spoon by 11 points and 14 strokes.

Williams's breakaway followed a familiar pattern: extend the lead dramatically in Round 2 (11 points), weather a wobble in Round 3 (shrinking to 5 points despite disasters on holes 10-11), then deliver the knockout punch with another 41-point finale. His 149 total points represented complete Stableford control while Mullin's consistency—four birdies, steady scoring—proved equally dominant in the gross competition.
