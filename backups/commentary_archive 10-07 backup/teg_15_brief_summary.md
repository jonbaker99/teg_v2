Gregg Williams completed a historic sweep of TEG 15, claiming his first Green Jacket alongside his third Trophy in a wire-to-wire performance of remarkable dominance. His 21-point Stableford margin and 29-stroke gross advantage—the largest combined margins in tournament history—saw him lead for 69 of 72 holes in the Stableford competition and 64 of 72 holes gross. Williams's even-par third round at Penha Longa, featuring four birdies, epitomized the consistency that separated him from the field.

Stuart Neumann's runner-up finish (136 points) represented a career breakthrough, climbing from zero Trophy wins to his best-ever result with four rounds of steady 26-43 point scoring. The battle behind them proved chaotic: John Patterson defended second place through two rounds before a catastrophic Round 4 quintuple bogey on the opening hole sent him tumbling to third, while Jon Baker's title challenge evaporated in Round 1 with consecutive disasters on holes 11-12 that cost him 22 points and both competition leads. David Mullin's Round 2 eagle couldn't offset wild inconsistency (gross rounds ranging from 13 to 33 strokes), though it helped secure fifth place.

Alex Baker collected his second career Wooden Spoon with 20 worse-than-double scores across the week, while the tournament's closing hole at Oitavos Dunes proved universally treacherous—five players including Williams carded disasters on the 18th, a fitting chaotic finale to a week of Williams's controlled brilliance.
