Gregg Williams returned to the Lisbon Coast and claimed everything on offer. His third Trophy arrived alongside his first Green Jacket in a wire-to-wire sweep of both competitions, the sort of comprehensive dismantling that leaves little room for narrative uncertainty. Twenty-one points clear in the Stableford, twenty-nine strokes ahead on gross scores. Leading after every single round in both formats. Wire-to-wire perfection across seventy-two holes.

Behind this exhibition of controlled dominance, Stuart Neumann emerged from the shadows of three previous Wooden Spoons to claim runner-up in the Trophy, his first career top-two finish. Jon Baker's early promise evaporated in a cascade of blow-ups across the opening two rounds. The final hole at Oitavos Dunes delivered appropriate chaos: five players recording blow-ups or worse on the eighteenth, including quintuple bogeys for both Neumann and John Patterson.

Alex Baker bookended the field with his second Wooden Spoon, finishing last in both competitions by margins that suggested a fundamentally difficult week. Thirteen Stableford zeros told most of the story. The forty-three-point gap to Williams in the Trophy rather completed it.

## Round 1: Early Skirmishes at Estoril

Multiple lead changes marked the opening eighteen at Estoril Golf Club, Portugal's first course and a tree-lined parkland where accuracy matters more than length. Jon Baker seized the lead at the first, matched par for three points. Williams responded immediately with back-to-back birdies at the third and fourth to grab control of both Trophy and Jacket. The drama arrived at the eleventh.

Baker's nine at the par-four eleventh cost him the lead he'd briefly reclaimed. Another nine followed immediately at the twelfth. These consecutive collapses—ten strokes, zero points across two holes—obliterated his position. Williams wasn't flawless himself, opening with an eight and closing with another, but three birdies across the middle section proved decisive. Thirty-nine points and seventeen gross gave him a five-point Trophy lead, eight strokes clear in the Jacket.

Neumann's round suggested the Spoon might find familiar company. Blow-ups at the first and third dropped him to the bottom. A ten at the fifteenth didn't help. Thirty-one points left him tied third with Baker, whose morning promise had dissolved into eleven consecutive holes averaging close to three over par. Patterson finished second with thirty-four points despite his own struggles. Five players recorded blow-ups at the twelfth. Nobody escaped unscathed.

## Round 2: Carnage at the Sixth

Williams extended both leads at West Cliffs, the modern links design that won Best New Course in 2017. Forty points and sixteen gross stretched his Trophy margin to nine, his Jacket lead to twenty-two strokes. The round belonged more to disasters than dominance. The sixth hole at West Cliffs—a par five—demolished five players simultaneously.

Alex Baker's eleven led the wreckage. David Mullin recorded a ten. Neumann matched him. Baker found an eight, Patterson a nine. Five blow-ups on a single par five, twenty-two combined strokes, zero points across the field. The carnage continued throughout. Baker suffered consecutive blow-ups at the opening holes. Neumann added disasters at the thirteenth and fourteenth, an eleven and a nine that stretched his gross to twelve over par across those two holes alone.

Mullin's eagle at the fifteenth—only the fourth in tournament history—provided brief respite from the chaos. Three strokes on the par five, earning five points. Williams suffered his own blow-up at that same hole, a ten that cost him the rare blemish of zero points. Jon Baker's nightmare continued with an eleven at the seventeenth, seven over par on a par four. Patterson claimed second with thirty-six points. Nine points behind felt like a chasm.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 79 | JP 70 | JB 60 | DM 63 | SN 57 | AB 57  
**Gross Standings:** GW +33 | DM +47 | JB +56 | JP +52 | AB +68 | SN +80

## Round 3: Three Birdies Seal Breakaway

Williams produced his defining round at Penha Longa, the mountain parkland course in the Sintra hills where steep terrain meets breathtaking coastal views. Forty-four points and ten gross. Three back-nine birdies—at the eighth, tenth and fifteenth—stretched his Trophy lead from nine points to eighteen. The contest for first place effectively ended on those three holes.

Neumann surged into second with forty-three points, his best round of the tournament and first hint of redemption after years haunting the Spoon end. Jon Baker rallied with forty-one points, including a birdie at the thirteenth. Patterson managed thirty-five despite blow-ups at the tenth and sixteenth. His two-hole stretch of fifteen strokes suggested volatility remained the defining characteristic.

Alex Baker's collapse accelerated. Four blow-ups between the seventh and fourteenth, including a ten at the fourteenth that averaged him to twelve over par across that nightmarish stretch. Twenty-nine points left him sixty-four behind Williams. The Jacket race had long since concluded. Williams now led by thirty-nine strokes on gross scores. Mullin stayed within touching distance on forty gross, but the gap to Williams proved insurmountable.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 123 | SN 100 | JB 101 | DM 103 | JP 105 | AB 86  
**Gross Standings:** GW +43 | DM +60 | JB +69 | JP +79 | SN +100 | AB +102

## Round 4: Final Hole Demolition

Williams cruised home with thirty-four points at Oitavos Dunes, Portugal's premier links and the country's top-ranked course. Twenty points gross. Comfortable, controlled, conclusive. The championship had been decided by Penha Longa's back nine. What remained was the final hole carnage.

The eighteenth at Oitavos—a par four along the Atlantic coast—wrecked five players. Neumann's quintuple bogey, nine strokes for zero points, capped his best Stableford round of thirty-six points with cruel symmetry. Patterson matched the quintuple after opening with another quintuple at the first. Jon Baker found an eight. Mullin managed an eight of his own. Even Williams recorded a seven, a triple bogey that mattered not at all.

Neumann's thirty-six points marked the round's best Stableford performance but couldn't salvage second place from Jon Baker, who limped home with thirty points. Patterson matched that total despite his opening-hole ten. Mullin collapsed to twenty-two points, his worst round dropping him from third to fifth. Alex Baker's twenty-eight points included another blow-up at the first and triple bogey at the last. Thirteen zeros across seventy-two holes told the story of his week.

**Trophy Standings:** GW 157 | SN 136 | JP 135 | JB 131 | DM 125 | AB 114

## Tournament Recap

Williams led sixty-nine of seventy-two holes in the Trophy, sixty-four of seventy-two in the Jacket. The sweep arrived via relentless consistency rather than explosive brilliance. Five birdies across the week. Twenty-eight pars. Never worse than +20 in a single round. The breakaway came at Penha Longa's back nine in Round 3, where three birdies in six holes stretched a nine-point lead to eighteen and effectively concluded the competition.

His twenty-one-point Trophy margin over Neumann represented the third-largest winning gap in tournament history. The twenty-nine-stroke Jacket victory ranked similarly dominant. First Green Jacket after two previous Trophy wins completed the career sweep, joining the exclusive club of players who've claimed both competitions. Total command across both formats suggested a player operating at a level the field couldn't approach.

Neumann's redemption arc provided the week's compelling subplot. Three Wooden Spoons, zero previous top-two finishes, then runner-up Trophy performance with 136 points. His forty-three-point Round 3 matched Williams' brilliance at Penha Longa, though by then the gap had grown too wide. The quintuple bogey at the final hole—nine strokes to close his best round—offered appropriate irony. Redemption never arrives without cost.

Jon Baker's early promise dissolved into eleven blow-ups across the tournament. Leading after the first hole, then consecutive nines at Estoril's eleventh and twelfth erased all advantage. An eleven at West Cliffs' seventeenth compounded the damage. Finished fourth in the Trophy, second in the Jacket, but those early collapses defined his week more than the recovery.

Patterson's volatility peaked with quintuple bogeys bookending his final round: opening ten, closing ten, twenty combined strokes on two par fours. Mullin's eagle at West Cliffs marked the tournament's single moment of genuine scoring brilliance, negated somewhat by his Round 4 collapse to twenty-two points, a career-worst that dropped him from third to fifth.

Alex Baker claimed his second Wooden Spoon via accumulation of small disasters. Thirteen Stableford zeros. Twenty worse-than-double bogeys. Only one birdie all week. Finished forty-three points behind Williams in the Trophy, seventy-one strokes back in the Jacket. Last place in both competitions by margins suggesting fundamental struggle rather than isolated blow-ups.

The final hole at Oitavos provided fitting conclusion to a tournament defined by Williams' control amid widespread chaos. Five players wrecked on the eighteenth, quintuple bogeys and blow-ups scattered across the field. Williams recorded his own triple bogey but crossed the line twenty-one points clear. Wire-to-wire dominance. Both trophies claimed. The sweep completed. Portugal conquered.

## Player-by-Player Summary

**Gregg Williams (1st Trophy, 1st Jacket):** Claimed his third Trophy and first Green Jacket with wire-to-wire dominance in both competitions, leading after every single round. His twenty-one-point Trophy margin and twenty-nine-stroke Jacket victory ranked among the most comprehensive in tournament history. Five birdies, twenty-eight pars, and relentless consistency defined his week, with the breakaway arriving via three back-nine birdies at Penha Longa in Round 3.

**Stuart Neumann (2nd Trophy):** Three Wooden Spoons in his previous appearances made his runner-up Trophy finish all the more remarkable, his first career top-two result. Forty-three points in Round 3 matched Williams' brilliance at Penha Longa, though by then the gap had grown too wide. The quintuple bogey at Oitavos' final hole—nine strokes to close his best round of thirty-six points—offered cruel symmetry to a redemption arc that never quite completed.

**John Patterson (3rd Trophy):** Volatility defined his tournament, bookending his final round with quintuple bogeys at the first and eighteenth holes. Twenty combined strokes on two par fours captured the essence of his week: flashes of competence punctuated by spectacular collapses. Finished third in the Trophy with 135 points but sixth in the Jacket, the divergence suggesting a player whose Stableford game masked underlying gross score struggles.

**Jon Baker (4th Trophy, 2nd Jacket):** Led after the opening hole, then consecutive nines at Estoril's eleventh and twelfth obliterated his position. Eleven blow-ups across the tournament told the story of early promise dissolving into chronic inconsistency. Finished fourth in the Trophy but second in the Jacket, those placings suggesting a player who never recovered from Round 1's two-hole, ten-stroke collapse.

**David Mullin (5th Trophy, 3rd Jacket):** Recorded the tournament's only eagle—three strokes on West Cliffs' par-five fifteenth, only the fourth eagle in tournament history—but his Round 4 collapse to twenty-two points, a career-worst, dropped him from third to fifth in the final Trophy standings. Thirty-three gross in the final round marked another personal nadir, suggesting a player whose brilliance couldn't sustain across seventy-two holes.

**Alex Baker (6th Trophy and Jacket, Wooden Spoon):** Claimed his second Wooden Spoon via accumulation of small disasters rather than isolated catastrophes. Thirteen Stableford zeros, twenty worse-than-double bogeys, only one birdie all week. Finished last in both competitions by forty-three points in the Trophy and seventy-one strokes in the Jacket, margins suggesting fundamental struggle across four rounds.
