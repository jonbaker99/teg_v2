John Patterson claimed his first TEG Trophy in dominant fashion, leading the Stableford competition for 53 of 72 holes in his tournament debut. His historic Round 2 explosion—a 49-point performance that tied the tournament record—seized both leads and set the stage for his six-point victory over Alex Baker. Meanwhile, David Mullin won his eighth Green Jacket with wire-to-wire gross dominance, leading all 72 holes except for an opening quad-bogey stumble and finishing 10 strokes clear of Patterson.

The real drama came on Praia D'El Rey's 14th hole in Round 4, where Alex Baker briefly wrested the Stableford lead from Patterson with his second birdie in six holes. But the moment proved fleeting—Baker faded over the closing stretch while Patterson's Round 4 birdie at the 12th helped secure his comfortable victory. The split champions told the story of a tournament divided: Patterson's wild volatility (rounds ranging from 49 to 34 points) contrasted sharply with Mullin's methodical consistency, while Stuart Neumann collected his third career Wooden Spoon despite a spirited final-round charge.
