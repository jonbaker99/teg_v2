David Mullin claimed his second TEG Trophy with a thrilling final-round surge, posting 36 points to overtake Jon Baker by three points in the Stableford standings. The win completed a dominant double-sweep as Mullin also secured his third Green Jacket, leading an astonishing 64 of 72 holes in the Gross competition to finish 19 strokes clear of Stuart Neumann. His consistency—with all four rounds falling within a three-stroke range—proved the perfect antidote to a tournament defined by disaster.

Baker's heartbreak told the alternate story. After leading the Stableford for 49 of 72 holes through three rounds, his back-nine implosion in Round 4 cost him the Trophy. A sextuple bogey at the 12th and quintuple at the 15th—part of a catastrophic stretch yielding just nine points over seven holes—sealed his fate as runner-up. The collapse was particularly cruel given his earlier brilliance, including an eagle at the 8th that briefly looked like the tournament-winning moment.

Gregg Williams endured a nightmare week, finishing last in both competitions with 28 triple bogeys or worse across 72 holes. His Round 3 nadir—three consecutive quadruple bogeys from the 2nd through 5th—epitomized a tournament-wide zero-point epidemic that saw 62 holes across the field yield no Stableford return. In East Sussex's debut as a TEG destination, survival proved as valuable as brilliance.
