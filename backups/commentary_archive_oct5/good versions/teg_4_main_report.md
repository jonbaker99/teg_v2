# The Mullin Masterclass: Double Triumph Amid East Sussex Carnage

David Mullin conquered both competitions at TEG 4, claiming his second Trophy with a dramatic final-round surge and his third Green Jacket through wire-to-wire dominance. The East Sussex swing—the tournament's first foray into this corner of England—became a theater of disasters where Mullin's consistency shone against a backdrop of catastrophic golf. His 137-point Trophy victory came by just three points after a nerve-shredding final round, while his 19-stroke Green Jacket triumph told a different story entirely: the relentless accumulation of small advantages over 72 holes, leading 64 of them in the gross competition.

Jon Baker's tournament will be remembered as one of the great heartbreaks in TEG history. After leading the Stableford standings for 49 of 72 holes—through Round 1 and again after Round 3—Baker authored a back-nine meltdown in Round 4 that ranks among the competition's most spectacular collapses. A sextuple bogey at the 12th, followed by a quintuple at the 15th, turned a commanding position into second place. Just nine points over those seven holes (H9-H15) sealed his fate. The cruel irony: his 134 points would have won most TEGs comfortably, but not this one, not against Mullin's relentless 137.

Yet Baker's anguish pales beside Gregg Williams' tournament-long horror show. Williams claimed the Wooden Spoon with authority, finishing last in both competitions after compiling 28 triple bogeys or worse—including three consecutive quadruple bogeys in Round 3 (H2-H5) that defied probability. His 14 zero-point holes led the field, though Henry Meller's 16 zero-pointers represented the tournament's true epidemic. Across the entire field, 62 holes produced zero points and 80 yielded triple bogeys or better. This was golf as survival exercise, where Mullin's mere competence became dominance.

The tale of two competitions revealed the tournament's deepest paradox: Baker excelled in Stableford (second with 134 points) while floundering in gross (fourth at +113), while Stuart Neumann reversed the script—second in gross (+100) despite fourth in Stableford (120 points). Only Mullin bridged both worlds, proving that in a tournament defined by volatility, consistency isn't flashy. It's simply unbeatable.

## Round-by-Round Report

### Round 1: Baker Seizes Control at Ashdown

The inaugural East Sussex chapter opened at Ashdown with Jon Baker serving notice of intent, posting 35 points to establish a four-point advantage over David Mullin in the Stableford standings. The margin felt comfortable rather than commanding, but Baker's round represented a masterclass in damage limitation on a day when disasters outnumbered highlights by orders of magnitude. His early four-pointer at the 1st grabbed both the gross and Stableford leads, setting the tone for a round that would see him survive two disasters while his competitors drowned in chaos.

The early exchanges told the story of opportunity seized and squandered. Gregg Williams burst from the gates with 19 points on the front nine, including a birdie at the 8th that pushed him into the Stableford lead alongside Mullin at the 7th. But Williams' front-nine promise evaporated on the back, where he managed just 10 points—a nine-point differential that foreshadowed darker days ahead. His quadruple bogey at the 4th had already hinted at the carnage to come, but nothing prepared anyone for what awaited Henry Meller at the 11th: a quintuple bogey that anchored a catastrophic stretch from holes 9-14 worth just six points.

Stuart Neumann's round followed a similar arc—17 points on the front nine crumbling to 11 on the back, with consecutive disasters at the 11th and 12th (averaging +2.33 vs par across multiple stretches) burying him in a seven-point deficit. Mullin, despite finding three birdies across the round at the 10th and 13th, managed just 31 points, his own disasters keeping him within touching distance but not threatening Baker's lead.

The final standings read like a casualty report: Baker 35 points (+26 gross), Mullin 31 (+23), Williams 29 (+36), with Neumann and Meller tied at 28 points but with wildly different gross scores (+28 and +32 respectively). Baker's four-point cushion represented safety rather than dominance, but after 18 holes of Ashdown's cruelties, any lead felt precious. The gap to fifth was seven points—substantial, but in a tournament where quintuple bogeys lurked around every corner, no advantage was secure.

### Round 2: The Lingfield Lottery

Jon Baker's four-point lead evaporated within three holes at Lingfield, and what followed was a masterclass in volatility. His birdie at the 3rd—a rare -1 gross yielding five points—briefly steadied the ship, but the day belonged to David Mullin and Henry Meller, who would finish tied atop the Stableford standings after 36 holes. The see-sawing lead changes told their own story: Mullin took control at the 11th, Baker reclaimed it at the 12th, Mullin wrestled it back at the 14th when Baker carded a triple bogey for zero points, and finally Meller snatched a share on the final hole as Mullin's own disaster (+4 gross, 0 points) saw him join Meller at 64 points total.

The round's narrative thread was chaos refined into competition. Baker's quintuple bogey at the 17th—his second zero of the day—dropped him from second to third in the Stableford standings, eight points behind the co-leaders at 63 total. What made his round particularly cruel was its volatility: that early birdie represented his only moment of genuine quality, while disasters at the 14th and 17th book-ended a back nine that saw his four-point cushion become a one-point deficit. His cold spell from holes 12-17 averaged +2.33 vs par and included both disasters, a six-hole stretch that cost him the lead he'd held since Round 1.

Meller's 36-point round topped the field and represented the tournament's best 18-hole performance, yet it came studded with contradictions. Three triple bogeys or worse, three zero-point holes, and an opening disaster at the 3rd (+4 gross) would have derailed lesser rounds. But three consecutive pars from holes 9-11—averaging even par in a tournament where par felt like birdie—anchored a performance that pulled him from fifth place into a tie for the lead. Mullin's 33 points included three zero-point holes of his own, but his ability to limit disasters to triple bogeys (never worse) began to establish the pattern that would define his tournament.

Williams continued his descent into infamy with six triple bogeys or worse yielding three zero-point holes, though his 31 points kept him within five of the lead. Neumann, despite 28 points matching his Round 1 output, slipped to fifth overall after an opening stretch from holes 1-3 produced just one point—disasters at the first two holes setting an impossible deficit. His cold spell from holes 1-6 (six points total) buried him eight points behind the leaders.

**Scores:** HM 64pts total/36pts R2/+20, DM 64pts/33pts/+22, JB 63pts/28pts/+33, GW 60pts/31pts/+35, SN 56pts/28pts/+27

### Round 3: The Crowborough Calamity

The tied lead lasted precisely one hole at Crowborough. Henry Meller's triple bogey or worse at the opening hole (seven on a par-4 for zero points) handed control to Jon Baker, whose three points at the 2nd restored him to the summit. What followed was the tournament's most sustained carnage—a round where 62 total zero-point holes across the field included Gregg Williams' three consecutive quadruple bogeys from holes 2-5, a sequence so catastrophic it defied rational explanation. Eight on par-fours, three times in four holes. Williams scored one point across holes 2-4, then repeated the feat from 3-5 and again from 4-6. His front nine yielded just 10 points against the back nine's 17, but that represented recovery rather than competence.

Baker's 39-point round temporarily silenced questions about his staying power, building a one-point lead over Mullin's 37 points. But the margin flatters the chaos. Baker's dominance came almost entirely on the front nine—22 points before the turn, including a four-pointer at the 12th. His back nine produced 17 points, solid enough to hold off Mullin but hardly commanding. The hole-by-hole battle saw Mullin briefly seize control at the 10th with a par on the par-5, only to surrender it back at the 11th with a bogey. Baker's front-loaded excellence and Mullin's consistency (the best gross round at +17) set up the final-day showdown.

Stuart Neumann's birdie at the 5th—a three on a par-4 worth four points—highlighted a front nine of 20 points that briefly pushed him into contention. But his own zero-point disaster at the 10th, part of a mass triple-bogey carnage that also claimed Baker and Meller, triggered a cold spell from holes 10-12 averaging +2.67 vs par. His consecutive disasters at the 10th and 11th (quadruple bogey at the latter) produced three zero-point holes from holes 9-11 and killed his challenge. The eight-point gap between his strong front nine (20 points) and fading back nine (12 points) told the story of another opportunity squandered.

Meller's nightmare continued with six triple bogeys or worse producing six zero-point holes, including disasters at the 10th, 14th, and the final hole—where Mullin, Meller, and Baker all carded triple bogeys or worse. His 23-point round represented the day's worst performance, dropping him from co-leader to fourth place (tied with Neumann at 84 points total). Williams' 27 points somehow kept him in mathematical contact, trailing by 76 points at 87 total, though his seven triple bogeys or worse and five zero-point holes suggested the Wooden Spoon was already engraved.

**Scores:** JB 103pts total/39pts R3/+21, DM 102pts/37pts/+17, SN 88pts/32pts/+23, HM 87pts/23pts/+31, GW 87pts/27pts/+38

### Round 4: Bletchingley's Brutal Denouement

Jon Baker's one-point lead lasted until David Mullin's opening par at Bletchingley's 1st, where Baker and Williams both carded triple bogeys. The margin was gossamer-thin, the tension genuine, and what unfolded over the next 18 holes will haunt Baker for years. Mullin's 36-point round reclaimed the Trophy lead, but the story was Baker's apocalyptic back-nine collapse—a sequence from holes 9-15 that produced just nine points and included a sextuple bogey at the 12th (six over par, zero points) and a quintuple at the 15th (six over for zero points again). His cold spell from holes 10-15 yielded two points across six holes, with disasters at the 10th, 12th, 14th, and 15th averaging +3.83 vs par.

The early exchanges had suggested a proper contest. Baker's birdie at the 2nd (four points) briefly reclaimed the Stableford lead before Mullin's steady accumulation—built on pars and the occasional bogey rather than fireworks—reasserted control. Baker's eagle at the 8th, part of a hot spell from holes 6-8 averaging -0.33 vs par, felt like a declaration of intent. Five points from an eagle. The gap narrowed, hope flickered, and then the 10th arrived. Mullin, Williams, and Baker all carded triple bogeys, but Baker's was part of a pattern, not an aberration. When the sextuple landed at the 12th—part of a cold spell from holes 10-12 producing one point—the one-point gap had become a five-point chasm.

Mullin's disaster at the 7th (four over, zero points) represented his only genuine wobble, but crucially he'd built enough cushion to absorb it. His three-point victory margin came from precisely these moments—limiting disasters to containable damage while Baker hemorrhaged points by the fistful. Mullin's 137 total points came from just 10 triple bogeys or worse across four rounds, a number that would represent failure in normal golf but constituted excellence here. His gross dominance told the same story: +81 total, 19 strokes clear of Neumann's +100, having led the gross competition for 64 of 72 holes.

Williams compiled his worst round—23 points, +43 gross—to cement the Wooden Spoon with nine triple bogeys or worse and four zero-point holes. His consecutive disasters at holes 5-6 (both four over) and again at 13-14 included zero points at the latter, where Baker also zeroed. Meller's quintuple bogey at the 11th (five over, zero points) represented his second five-plus bogey of the round, both coming at the same hole (matching his Round 1 disaster there), part of a tournament where his 16 zero-point holes led all competitors. Neumann's quiet 32 points secured second in gross (+100) despite fourth in Stableford, the inverse of Baker's trajectory.

**Final Scores:** DM 137pts/36pts R4/+81 gross, JB 134pts/32pts/+113, HM 121pts/34pts/+107, SN 120pts/32pts/+100, GW 110pts/23pts/+152

## Tournament Recap

David Mullin's double triumph represented two entirely different victories packaged under one name. The Trophy win required a final-round surge and nerves of steel—that three-point margin over Baker coming down to who could limit the bleeding on a day when disasters queued like passengers at a bus stop. The Green Jacket, by contrast, was never in doubt: 64 of 72 holes led, 19 strokes clear, the mathematical inevitability of someone who treated par as a target rather than a fantasy. In a tournament where 80 triple bogeys or worse littered the landscape, Mullin compiled just 10. This was excellence redefined by context.

Jon Baker's 134 points would have won TEG 1, 2, or 3 comfortably. Instead, it bought him heartbreak and a runners-up trophy that will sit heavy in the cabinet. Leading for 49 of 72 holes means nothing when the final stretch unravels, and those seven holes from 9-15 in Round 4—nine points, two zeros, a sextuple and a quintuple—will replay in slow motion for years. The cruelest cut? His Stableford excellence (second) and gross futility (fourth at +113) exposed the tournament's central truth: in handicapped golf, volatility loses to consistency every time. Stuart Neumann learned the inverse lesson, his second-place gross finish (+100) against fourth in Stableford (120 points) proving that steady accumulation in one competition means little when the points dry up in the other.

Gregg Williams' 28 triple bogeys or worse—including those three consecutive quads in Round 3 that entered TEG folklore—earned him the Wooden Spoon in both competitions with a thoroughness that almost qualified as achievement. His +152 gross and 110 Stableford points came despite zero-point holes on 14 occasions, a number that would have been higher if not for the peculiar grace of occasionally scoring one point instead. East Sussex's courses had broken him comprehensively, and in doing so, they'd thrown Mullin's consistency into sharpest relief. Four new courses, four rounds of contained chaos, and two trophies heading to the same cabinet. Sometimes dominance doesn't roar. Sometimes it just keeps showing up, avoiding the worst, and letting everyone else self-destruct.
