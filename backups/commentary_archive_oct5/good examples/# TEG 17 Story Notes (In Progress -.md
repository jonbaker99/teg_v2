# Round 1: Patterson Seizes Lead Despite Rocky Start at Praia D'El Rey

## Tournament Context Coming In

The TEG 17 tournament kicked off at Praia D'El Rey on Portugal's scenic Lisbon Coast with five players ready to battle across the challenging layout. With no previous round history to lean on, everyone started from scratch, making the opening round critical for establishing position and momentum.

## How Round 1 Unfolded

The tournament began with immediate chaos. Alex Baker grabbed the early lead after the first hole, but that promising start belied the carnage about to unfold. Both David Mullin and John Patterson opened with disasters—Mullin posting a triple-bogey 7 on the par-4 first, while Patterson went one worse with a quadruple-bogey 8. Baker's three Stableford points gave him the early advantage, though Gregg Williams and Jon Baker were right there alongside him in the gross standings.

The front nine quickly separated into two distinct narratives. Jon Baker caught fire early, building a 22-point Stableford effort on the front side that would prove the day's best. His par on the par-3 third hole gave him the Stableford lead by hole three, a position he'd hold for most of the day. Meanwhile, Alex Baker's round imploded spectacularly. After his solid start, Baker endured a nightmare stretch from holes 2-7, managing just 7 Stableford points across those six holes while averaging a staggering +3.0 strokes over par. The damage was concentrated in a brutal three-hole sequence from holes 3-5 where he scored zero points—a triple-bogey 6 on the par-3 third, followed by a quadruple-bogey 8 on the fourth, and capped by an unthinkable 10 on the par-4 fifth hole, six shots over par.

By the turn, Jon Baker held the Stableford lead with 22 points, while Gregg Williams was tied atop the gross leaderboard at 12 over par through nine. David Mullin's disastrous start had left him in last place with just 10 Stableford points on the front nine, averaging over +2 strokes per hole.

The back nine, however, delivered the day's most compelling drama. John Patterson, who had stumbled to just 16 points on the front side after that opening disaster, suddenly found his rhythm. His hot streak from holes 8-13 produced a perfect 18 Stableford points—anchored by a birdie on the par-5 12th hole that gave him momentum heading into the home stretch. Patterson's surge continued through holes 11-16, where he collected another 18 points, including birdies on both the 15th and 16th holes. That remarkable closing burst vaulted him into the Stableford lead by hole 16, which he wouldn't relinquish.

David Mullin authored an equally impressive comeback. After his nightmare start, Mullin caught fire from holes 9-14, posting 18 Stableford points in that six-hole window—matching par exactly in gross scoring. The highlight came on the par-4 13th, where his birdie sparked the rally. That hot stretch spanning holes 10-16 saw him collect 18 points while averaging just +0.17 strokes over par, transforming his round from disaster to respectability with a back-nine 23 points—13 shots better than his front-nine showing.

Jon Baker, meanwhile, couldn't sustain his early brilliance. After dominating the front nine as the day's strongest starter, he faded badly coming home with just 16 points on the back side. Disasters on holes 10 and 17—both triple-bogeys—derailed his momentum and cost him the Stableford lead he'd held for 13 holes.

The final holes provided fitting drama. Patterson hit trouble on the 18th with a triple-bogey, but his lead was secure. Alex Baker's misery continued with a quintuple-bogey 9 on the par-4 finisher, scoring zero points and cementing his place at the bottom of the leaderboard. Gregg Williams parred the 18th to claim the outright gross lead, while Williams had spent much of the middle stretch cold—posting just 8 Stableford points from holes 5-10 with a disaster on the fifth—but steadied down the stretch.

## Tournament Context After Round 1

**Stableford Leaderboard:**
1. John Patterson - 39 points
2. Jon Baker - 38 points (-1)
3. Gregg Williams - 33 points (-6)
3. David Mullin - 33 points (-6)
5. Alex Baker - 32 points (-7)

**Gross Leaderboard:**

2. Jon Baker - +20 (tied)
3. John Patterson - +23 (+3)
4. David Mullin - +24 (+4)
5. Alex Baker - +41 (+21)

John Patterson holds a precarious one-point lead in the Stableford competition, with Jon Baker breathing down his neck after squandering his front-nine dominance. The gross race features a dead heat between Williams and Baker, setting up an intriguing second round.

The momentum indicators paint a clear picture heading into Round 2: Patterson and Mullin are surging after dominant back-nine performances (23 points each), while Jon Baker (+6 on the front nine versus back nine) needs to rediscover his early form. Williams showed resilience recovering from his mid-round struggles, while Alex Baker faces a daunting 21-stroke deficit in the gross standings and seven points back in Stableford after enduring multiple disasters throughout his round.

With such tight margins at the top and several players showing late momentum, Round 2 promises fireworks on the Lisbon Coast.
