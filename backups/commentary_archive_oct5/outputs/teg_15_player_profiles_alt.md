# TEG 15 - Player Profiles

---

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 1st (Stableford: 157 pts, **1st Trophy after 5 runner-ups**) | 1st (Gross: 48 strokes, **1st Green Jacket**)

After five consecutive runner-up finishes across six tournaments, Gregg Williams finally converted silver into gold. One hundred fifty-seven Stableford points won by 7 over defending champion David (150). Forty-eight strokes over par won gross by 10. The perpetual runner-up had become the champion.

**The Five Silver Medals:**
- TEG 10: 2nd, 173 pts (+11 behind Alex's record 184)
- TEG 11: 2nd, 136 pts (+7 behind Jon)
- TEG 12: 2nd, 162 pts (+10 behind Patterson)
- TEG 13: 2nd, 155 pts (+3 behind Jon, closest finish)
- TEG 14: 2nd, 150 pts (+4 behind David)

Five runner-up finishes. Five times watching someone else lift trophies. Then TEG 15 arrived, and Gregg finally broke through.

## David MULLIN - 2nd (Stableford: 150 pts, +7) | 2nd (Gross: 58 strokes, +10)

David Mullin holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 2 for eagleâ€”the fourth and final eagle in TEG history through 17 tournamentsâ€”and still finished runner-up by 7 points. Across 1,224 holes of golf, only four eagles have been scored. David's was the last, and it came in a losing effort.

**The Final Eagle:** Hole 15, Round 2, Portugal. Par 5. David holed his second shot for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. The fourth TEG eagle ever. Also the last one scored through TEG 17 (102 more rounds of golf followed with zero eagles).

**The Four Eagles in History:**
1. Jon Baker (TEG 4, R4 H8, par 4)
2. Stuart Neumann (TEG 12, R4 H15, par 5)
3. John Patterson (TEG 13, R4 H2, par 5) - Patterson's 2nd
4. David Mullin (TEG 15, R2 H15, par 5) - **THE LAST EVER**

## Jon BAKER - 4th (Stableford: 144 pts, +13) | 3rd (Gross: 67 strokes, +19)

Jon Baker finished fourth with 144 Stableford points one tournament after collecting his first wooden spoon. The recovery from last to fourth is technically improvement, even if fourth in a five-player field is still closer to last than first.

**The Rounds:** 37-37-35-35. Metronomically mediocre across four rounds. Jon posted identical scores in pairs (37-37, 35-35), suggesting he'd found his level and decided staying there was acceptable.

**Never Threatened:** Fourth after Round 1. Third after Round 2. Fourth after Rounds 3-4. Jon spent the tournament oscillating between third and fourth, never threatening the podium, never risking the wooden spoon.

## Henry MELLER - 5th (Stableford: 137 pts, +20) | 4th (Gross: 74 strokes, +26)

Henry Meller posted 137 Stableford points to finish fifth, which is becoming his natural habitat. Not wooden spoon, not podium, just perpetually fifth.

**The Rounds:** 35-34-35-33. Henry treated consistency like a religion, posting scores in the mid-30s with the reliability of geological processes. Started fifth, stayed fifth, finished fifth.

**Never Threatened Anything:** Fifth after every round. Henry spent the tournament exactly where everyone predicted he'd be: mid-table mediocrity with zero drama.

## Alex BAKER - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 133 pts, +24) | 5th (Gross: 84 strokes, +36)

Alex Baker collected the wooden spoon with 133 Stableford points one tournament after brother Jon did the same. The Baker brothers had achieved synchronized failure: Jon (TEG 14 WS), Alex (TEG 15 WS). Family traditions include holidays, recipes, and apparently wooden spoons.

**The Baker Brothers' Spoon Collection:**
- Jon: TEG 14 wooden spoon (125 pts)
- Alex: TEG 15 wooden spoon (133 pts)

Consecutive tournaments, consecutive Baker wooden spoons. The family that finishes last together stays together, presumably commiserating over which brother is more disappointing.
