# TEG 3 - Brief Summary

Jon Baker claimed his first TEG Trophy with a dominant wire-to-wire performance at Boavista, finishing with 164 Stableford points—a commanding 17-point margin over David Mullin. Leading after all four rounds, Jon's consistency proved unstoppable: 45, 41, 35, and 43-point rounds showcased the kind of relentless accumulation that grinds opponents into submission. This was redemption golf, twelve months after his Round 3 collapse cost him TEG 2.

The tournament's compelling subplot saw David Mullin claim his second consecutive Green Jacket despite finishing 17 points behind Jon in Stableford. David's gross scoring dominance—72 strokes, 12 clear of second-placed Stu—proved that zero birdies across four rounds doesn't matter if you simply don't make mistakes. The divergence between the two competitions made for fascinating viewing: Jon mastered points accumulation, David mastered stroke play.

Gregg Williams secured bronze with 138 points, while Henry Meller's 137 points earned fourth. Stuart Neumann collected the wooden spoon with 135 points, though his second-place gross finish epitomized the curious mathematics of TEG golf—last in points, runner-up in strokes. Two champions, two different games, one tournament that proved consistency beats everything.
