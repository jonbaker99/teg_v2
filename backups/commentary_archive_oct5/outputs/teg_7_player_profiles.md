# TEG 7 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 7*

---

## Henry MELLER - "The One-Hit Wonder"

**Final Position:** 1st (Net vs Par: 175 pts) | 4th (Gross)

### The Review

Henry Meller won his first and only TEG Trophy at Praia D'El Rey by discovering what happens when you score 100 points in two rounds: you win. Comprehensively.

**The Opening Blitz:** Forty-nine points in Round 1. Fifty-one in Round 2. ONE HUNDRED POINTS IN 36 HOLES. That's not golf; that's a demolition. A 19-point lead after Round 2. Game. Over.

**The Decline:** Then came Rounds 3 and 4: 37 and 38 points. Henry went from dominant to merely adequate, but when you've built a 19-point cushion, "adequate" is more than enough. The lead shrank to 5, but 5 was sufficient.

**The Wire-to-Wire:** Led for 72 consecutive holes. Never trailed. Never even looked threatened until he started posting 37s and everyone realized Henry had used up all his golf in the first two days.

**The Only One:** This was Henry's only TEG Trophy. His career highlight. His shining moment. The one time everything clicked and Henry dominated from start to finish. It would never happen again.

**Signature Moment:** Those opening two rounds. 49-51. When your signature achievement is "100 points in 36 holes," you peaked early and peaked hard.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry's only TEG Trophy was earned through spectacular early golf followed by managed decline. Won by 5. Led for 72 holes. Collected his only championship. The one-hit wonder of TEG golf.

**Rating:** 10/10 for R1-R2. 6/10 for R3-R4. 10/10 for his only Trophy. 10/10 for never doing it again.

## David MULLIN - "The Sixth Jacket"

**Final Position:** 2nd= (Net vs Par: 170 pts, +5) | 1st (Gross, **Green Jacket**)

### The Review

David Mullin tied for second with 170 points, five behind Henry's winning total, and collected his sixth consecutive Green Jacket because the streak doesn't care about your net position.

**The Chase:** Started 3 points behind Henry after R1. Fell to 19 points behind after R2's 51-point Henry explosion. Closed to 5 by the finish. Valiant effort. Completely insufficient.

**The Tie:** One hundred seventy points, tied with Gregg for second. Shared silver. The indignity.

**The Green Jacket:** Sixth consecutive. From tied second place. David's streak of gross dominance continued regardless of his net position. Different competition, same David, same result.

**The Rounds:** 46-46-41-43. Decent. Professional. Not enough to beat Henry's opening blitz. When someone scores 100 in two rounds, your steady 40s look pedestrian.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting the Green Jacket from tied second. When your signature achievement is "won a different competition while sharing silver," you're David Mullin maintaining a streak.

**Overall Assessment:** David's sixth consecutive Green Jacket was earned from tied second in net. The streak continues. The paradox persists. Sixth year running, David collects a Green Jacket. This time from shared second place.

**Rating:** 7/10 for net (tied 2nd). 10/10 for Green Jacket. 10/10 for six-year streak.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Other Second Place"

**Final Position:** 2nd= (Net vs Par: 170 pts, +5) | 3rd (Gross)

### The Review

Gregg Williams tied for second with 170 points, matching David but finishing without a Green Jacket to show for it.

**The Year After:** Last year Gregg won his first Trophy while declining each round. This year he finished tied second while... also declining after R2. Patterns!

**The Rounds:** 46-40-42-42. Started well, dipped in R2, recovered for R3-R4. Decent golf that fell 5 points short of Henry's total and tied with David for second.

**The Tie:** One hundred seventy points. Same as David. Except David got the Green Jacket and Gregg got... joint second place and a pat on the back.

**Signature Moment:** Tying for second with David a year after winning. When your signature achievement is "regression to runner-up," you're Gregg Williams in his second year.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's tied second was earned through solid golf that couldn't match Henry's early brilliance. Same points as David. No Green Jacket to show for it. Back to chasing rather than winning.

**Rating:** 7/10 for performance. 5/10 for not winning. 0/10 for Green Jackets collected.

## Stuart NEUMANN - "One Point Short"

**Final Position:** 4th (Net vs Par: 169 pts, +6) | 2nd (Gross)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann finished fourth with 169 points, one agonizing point behind the joint second-place total, and somehow claimed second in gross scoring.

**The Agony:** One hundred sixty-nine points. David and Gregg: 170. ONE POINT. Stuartfinished one point from sharing second and probably spent the flight home calculating where that point disappeared.

**The Rounds:** 45-45-40-42. Solid. Professional. Exactly one point insufficient for joint second. The mathematics of cruelty.

**The gross Silver:** Second in gross scoring! Behind David's sixth consecutive Green Jacket. Stuartfinished second in gross from fourth in net. The paradox lite returns.

**Signature Moment:** Missing joint second by one point. When your signature achievement is "agonizingly close but still fourth," you're StuartNeumann.

**Overall Assessment:** Stu's fourth place was earned through solid golf that fell exactly one point short of anything meaningful. Second in gross, fourth in net, one point from tying for second. Golf's mathematics were particularly cruel to Stuartthis week.

**Rating:** 7/10 for performance. 0/10 for that one missing point. 8/10 for gross scoring.

## Jon BAKER - "The Forgotten Fifth"

**Final Position:** 5th (Net vs Par: 164 pts, +11) | 5th (Gross)

### The Review

Jon Baker finished fifth with 164 points in a tournament where finishing fifth meant you were thoroughly forgotten.

**The Rounds:** 43-40-42-39. That's not inspiring; that's treading water while watching Henry build an insurmountable lead and everyone else fight for scraps.

**The Gap:** Eleven points behind Henry. Six points behind the joint second. One point behind Stu's fourth. Fifth place, thoroughly earned, thoroughly forgettable.

**Signature Moment:** Finishing fifth. When your signature achievement is "present but irrelevant," you're Jon Baker at TEG 7.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's fifth place was earned through unremarkable golf in a tournament dominated by Henry's opening blitz. Fifth in net, fifth in gross. Complete alignment of mediocrity.

**Rating:** 5/10 for performance. 2/10 for threatening anyone. 3/10 for memorable moments.

## Alex BAKER - "The Debut Disaster"

**Final Position:** 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Net vs Par: 152 pts, +23) | 6th (Gross)

### The Review

Alex Baker made his TEG debut at Praia D'El Rey and immediately collected the wooden spoon with 152 points, 23 behind Henry's winning total.

**The Welcome:** Welcome to TEG, Alex! Here's a wooden spoon. You came last. Enjoy your stay.

**The Rounds:** 39-38-41-34. That's not a learning curve; that's consistent incompetence with a particularly bad final round thrown in for variety.

**The Gap:** Twenty-three points behind Henry. Eight points behind Jon's fifth place. Last in both net and gross. Comprehensive failure in all formats.

**The Debut:** First TEG, first wooden spoon. Some people ease into things; Alex dove headfirst into last place.

**Signature Moment:** Debuting with a wooden spoon. When your signature achievement is "immediate failure," you're Alex Baker at TEG 7.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex's wooden spoon debut was earned through being new and thoroughly outclassed. First TEG, last place, 23 points from victory. Welcome to TEG, Alex. It gets... well, hopefully it gets better.

**Rating:** 2/10 for performance. 10/10 for memorable debut (wrong kind of memorable).
