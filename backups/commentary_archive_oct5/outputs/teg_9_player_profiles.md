# TEG 9 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 9*

## John PATTERSON - "The Debut Assassin"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 168 pts) | 3rd (Gross: 88 strokes)

### The Review

John Patterson walked into his first TEG at Royal Óbidos and proceeded to demonstrate that winning tournaments doesn't require flair, fireworks, or even particularly interesting golf. It just requires being slightly less terrible than everyone else, consistently, for 72 holes straight.

**The Rounds:** 38-49-34-47 Stableford points. That's not a scoring progression; that's a rollercoaster designed by someone who's never experienced excitement. Patterson won rounds 2 and 4, finished joint-4th in rounds 1 and 3, and somehow emerged with a 6-point victory. It's the golfing equivalent of winning a marathon by occasionally jogging.

**The Wire-to-Wire Myth:** Patterson led for 53 of 72 holes in Stableford. That sounds impressive until you realize he never threatened in gross (led for 1 hole), suggesting his dominance was less "crushing superiority" and more "everyone else was rubbish at Stableford scoring."

**The Round 2 Statement:** Forty-nine Stableford points. FORTY-NINE. Two birdies, a back nine score of 30 points, and a performance that suggested Patterson might actually know what he was doing. It was his best ever TEG round (still is, actually), and it effectively won him the tournament by Round 2.

**The Birdie Situation:** Four birdies in four rounds. Patterson treated birdies like rare collectibles—something to acquire occasionally to prove you're participating, but not something to obsess over. He won with bog-standard golf played competently.

**Signature Moment:** That 49-point Round 2 masterpiece which announced to the field "I'm here on debut, and you're all in trouble."

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson's debut trophy was earned through the kind of efficient, drama-free golf that makes highlight reels unnecessary. He arrived, he conquered, he departed. No theatrics, no collapses, no memorable disasters. Just four rounds of solid golf that proved sometimes boring wins.

**Rating:** 10/10 for winning on debut. 3/10 for entertainment. 8/10 for establishing early dominance.

## Alex BAKER - "The Nearly Man"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 162 pts, +6) | 6th (Gross: 127 strokes, +60)

### The Review

Alex Baker's TEG 9 can be summarized as follows: he finished second in his personal best TEG performance while also finishing dead last in gross. This is golf's version of quantum mechanics—existing in two states simultaneously, both of them confusing, one of them deeply embarrassing.

**The Paradox:** Personal best Stableford (162 points, 2nd all-time). Worst gross finish (6th, 60 strokes behind David). Second in points, last in strokes. Alex somehow achieved golf's greatest contradiction—simultaneously excellent and terrible.

**The Rounds:** 32-44-42-44 Stableford points. After a pedestrian opening round, Baker posted three consecutive 40+ point rounds, including winning Round 3 with 42 points. This was competent, consistent Stableford golf. It still wasn't enough.

**The Front Nine Mastery:** Round 2's front nine posted 25 points. Round 3's front nine posted 24 points. Baker discovered the secret to Stableford golf: play well on the front nine, then coast home on fumes and determination.

**The Birdie Drought:** Two birdies. Total. For the entire tournament. Baker went 61 holes without a birdie (R1 H1 to R4 H7), which is less a drought and more a desert. That's golf's version of a hunger strike, except instead of food, you're refusing to score better than par.

**The gross Catastrophe:** Last place with 127 strokes. Alex treated gross scoring like a concept that happened to other people. Nine triple-bogeys-or-worse in Round 1 alone. This wasn't golf; this was survival.

**Signature Moment:** Posting his personal best TEG while simultaneously finishing last in gross. The cognitive dissonance must have been spectacular.

**Overall Assessment:** Baker proved that Stableford golf and gross golf are two completely different sports, and you can excel at one while catastrophically failing at the other. Runner-up tastes sweet when it's your best ever. Still tastes like failure when you finished last in half the competitions.

**Rating:** 9/10 for Stableford. 1/10 for gross. 10/10 for confusing absolutely everyone.

## David MULLIN - "The Green Jacket Collector"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 148 pts, +20) | 1st (Gross: 67 strokes, **8th Green Jacket**)

### The Review

David Mullin arrived at TEG 9 and collected his eighth consecutive Green Jacket by finishing third in Stableford. THIRD. By this point, the paradox had achieved self-awareness. David no longer needed to win Stableford to win gross. He just needed to show up, not embarrass himself, and let everyone else collapse.

**The Streak:** Eight consecutive Green Jackets. EIGHT. This is no longer a streak; it's a dynasty. It's a dictatorship. David has occupied the gross throne longer than some actual monarchs.

**The Dominance:** Led 62 of 72 holes in gross. Won all four rounds in gross. Never threatened in Stableford (led 12 holes, never led after any round). This is what peak efficiency looks like—dominate one competition entirely, finish respectably in the other, go home with hardware.

**The Rounds:** 38-39-33-38 Stableford points. Metronomic. Consistent. Utterly devoid of drama. David played golf like someone filing taxes—methodical, accurate, completely free of entertainment value.

**The Birdie Situation:** Two birdies in 72 holes. David went 33 holes without a birdie from Round 3 onwards (R3 H4 to R4 H18). He doesn't need birdies. He just needs everyone else to make more mistakes than him. It's working.

**The 18th Hole Incident:** Round 2, hole 18. Triple bogey. Zero points. David briefly remembered what disaster feels like, then spent the next 36 holes ensuring it never happened again.

**Signature Moment:** Winning his eighth consecutive Green Jacket from third place. At this point, it's not impressive—it's expected.

**Overall Assessment:** David's eighth Green Jacket was earned through the kind of grinding, relentless competence that makes people wonder if he's secretly a robot. Third in Stableford, first in gross, first in making everyone else look incompetent. The paradox continues.

**Rating:** 10/10 for gross dominance. 6/10 for Stableford mediocrity. 10/10 for maintaining the streak.

## Jon BAKER - "The Also-Ran"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 146 pts, +22) | 2nd (Gross: 77 strokes, +10)

### The Review

Jon Baker spent TEG 9 proving that you can lead after Round 1 and still finish fourth. It's a masterclass in squandering early promise.

**The Opening Statement:** Round 1's 39 points led the tournament. Jon opened strong, looked threatening, and briefly suggested he might trouble Patterson's debut coronation. Then he remembered he was Jon.

**The Fade:** After leading by 1 after Round 1, Baker posted 37-34-36 points across the final three rounds. Not terrible. Not good enough. The kind of golf that earns you fourth place and a participation trophy.

**Brief Moment of Contention:** Jon led for 14 holes in Stableford after Round 1. Held the lead for exactly one round before Patterson remembered he was playing a golf tournament and politely reclaimed it with a 49-point demolition job.

**The gross Silver Medal:** Second place with 77 strokes, 10 behind David. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that makes people nod appreciatively while secretly wondering if you'll ever actually win gross.

**The Birdie Count:** Three birdies. Jon went 34 holes without a birdie from the start (R1 H1 to R2 H16), suggesting he spent the first 34 holes warming up. By the time he figured out where the birdies lived, the tournament was over.

**Signature Moment:** Leading after Round 1, then watching Patterson destroy the field with 49 points while Jon posted a pedestrian 37.

**Overall Assessment:** Baker provided the tournament's only hint of drama by leading after Round 1, then promptly fading into mid-pack mediocrity. Fourth place. Runner-up in gross. The kind of week where you played well enough to avoid embarrassment but not well enough to matter.

**Rating:** 7/10 for Round 1. 5/10 for everything else. 3/10 for converting early leads into trophies.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Zero-Birdie Warrior"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 143 pts, +25) | 4th (Gross: 115 strokes, +48)

### The Review

Gregg Williams posted 143 Stableford points across four rounds without recording a single birdie. ZERO. Not one. This is golf's equivalent of writing a novel without using the letter 'e'—technically possible, impressively difficult, utterly pointless.

**The Birdie Drought:** 72 holes. Zero birdies. Gregg treated birdies like mythical creatures—rumored to exist, occasionally spotted by others, never actually encountered personally. He went an entire tournament without once playing a hole better than par.

**The Consistency:** 31-36-38-38 Stableford points. Gregg improved each round with the drama of watching grass grow. Started poorly, finished respectably, never threatened. It's the scoring progression of someone who read the assignment, understood the assignment, decided "fifth place will do nicely."

**The Triple Bogey Collection:** Eleven triples or worse across four rounds. Gregg collected disasters like Pokémon cards—methodically, consistently, with no apparent strategy to stop.

**The Streak:** 17 consecutive holes over par (R1 H4 to R2 H2). Gregg spent 17 holes making bogeys like it was his job. When your longest streak is "failing to make par," you know it's been that kind of week.

**Championship Implications:** None. Gregg was never winning this. Never in contention. Never threatening. He was golf's equivalent of a supporting actor—necessary for the plot, utterly forgettable in the grand scheme.

**Signature Moment:** Completing 72 holes without a birdie. When your signature moment is an absence of good golf, the universe is trying to tell you something.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg finished fifth with 143 points and zero birdies, proving that you can post respectable Stableford scores without once playing particularly well. It's a skill. A depressing, joyless skill, but a skill nonetheless.

**Rating:** 5/10 for consistency. 2/10 for entertainment. 0/10 for birdies (literally).

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Wooden Spoon Collector"

**Final Position:** 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 127 pts, +41) | 5th (Gross: 125 strokes, +58)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 127 Stableford points, an improvement of 27 points from last year's catastrophic 100-point disaster. This is what progress looks like when you start from rock bottom—technically better, still comprehensively last.

**The Improvement:** From 100 points (TEG 8) to 127 points (TEG 9). Twenty-seven points better! Still 16 points behind fifth place. It's like celebrating a promotion from "terrible" to "merely bad."

**The Opening Disaster:** Round 1 posted 23 points and eight triple-bogeys-or-worse. EIGHT. Stuartparticipated in what can only be described as synchronized golfing incompetence with Royal Óbidos, discovering that some courses have teeth and will bite you repeatedly.

**The 5-Hole Horror:** Holes 14-18 of Round 1 featured five consecutive triple-bogeys-or-worse. Five disasters, back-to-back, like dominos falling except the dominos are your hopes and they're all on fire. Stuartfinished the opening round already 16 points behind the leader.

**The Recovery Attempt:** Rounds 2-4 posted 30-37-37 points. Noble. Admirable. Completely insufficient to undo Round 1's carnage. It's like apologizing for burning down a house by offering to mow the lawn.

**The Birdie Situation:** One birdie. Total. At hole 13 of Round 4. Stuartwent 66 holes without a birdie (R1 H1 to R4 H12), which is less a drought and more an extinction-level event. When you finally record a birdie on your 67th hole, it's not celebration—it's relief.

**The 20-Hole Misery:** Twenty consecutive holes over par (R2 H4 to R3 H5). Stuartspent 20 holes making bogeys or worse, proving that some streaks are achievements and some are just sad.

**Signature Moment:** That 5-hole triple-bogey streak to end Round 1. When your signature moment is five consecutive disasters, you're not making highlights—you're making cautionary tales.

**Overall Assessment:** Stu's second consecutive wooden spoon was earned through a catastrophic opening round and a valiant but futile recovery. Last place, 41 points behind the winner, but 27 points better than last year. It's progress. Depressing, distant progress, but progress.

**Rating:** 3/10 for performance. 6/10 for improvement. 2/10 for avoiding last place.
