# TEG 5 Story Notes - THE PARADOX

## Location & Venue
- **Algarve, Portugal** - Return to Algarve after UK experiment (TEG 4)
- **Back to Boavista** - 3 rounds at spiritual home, plus Palmares
- Returning to familiar territory after England adventure

### The Courses
**Boavista** (R1-R3) - Championship par-71 designed by Howard Swan. Spectacular Monchique and Atlantic views.
**Course Record:** 4 over par - David Mullin (TEG 10, R1)

**Palmares - Lagos/Praia** (R4) - Algarve coastal course with ocean views.
**Course Record:** 17 over par - Henry Meller (TEG 5, R4)

## Key Points
- **THE PARADOX:** David wins Green Jacket AND wooden spoon! (Last net vs par scoring)
- **Jon Wins Trophy:** 156 pts (net vs par format), 11-pt margin over Gregg
- **David's 4th Consecutive GJ:** 92 gross strokes, 6 clear
- **Gregg's Best Finish:** 2nd with 145 pts (career high)
- **Net vs Par Format:** Last tournament before switch to Stableford (TEG 6+)

## How It Unfolded
R1: Jon 45 (+4 over Gregg 41), David 29 (last but leads gross!)
R2: Jon 38, Gregg 36, David 30 (still last, still leads gross)
R3: Jon 38, Henry 36 (3 birdies), Gregg 35, David 27
R4: Jon 35, Gregg 37, Stuart38, Henry 34, David 26

## The Beautiful Absurdity
- David: 4th consecutive GJ, first WS
- Same golf = champion AND blow-up
- Net scoring hated David's high handicap
- gross scoring loved David's consistency
- Golf's most absurd outcome

## Story Angles
- "Champion and wooden spoon holder - same weekend"
- Jon's wire-to-wire (again)
- Gregg's career-best 2nd
- Last net vs par tournament
