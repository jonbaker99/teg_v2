# TEG 12 Tournament Report: Patterson's Redemption and TEG's Second Eagle

**Catalonia, Spain | October 2019**
**PGA Catalunya Tour and Stadium Courses (both played twice)**
**Course Records: Tour (12 over, Jon Baker TEG 11 R2), Stadium (17 over, Jon Baker R4)**

Two years after collecting the wooden spoon with zero birdies, John Patterson returned to PGA Catalunya and posted 172 Stableford pointsâ€”the third-best score in TEG historyâ€”to win his second TEG Trophy. The redemption arc was complete: wooden spoon (TEG 10) to fourth place (TEG 11) to champion (TEG 12).

Meanwhile, Jon Baker won his second consecutive Green Jacket from fourth place in Stableford, proving the David Mullin paradox was contagious. And Stuart Neumann holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 4 for eagleâ€”only the second eagle in 12 tournaments of TEG history.

TEG 12 delivered redemption, history, and David's second consecutive wooden spoon. Sometimes tournaments write their own storylines.

## Patterson's 172-Point Masterclass

John Patterson opened with 46 Stableford pointsâ€”his best-ever roundâ€”and never looked back. Forty-six, 42, 39, 45 across four rounds. The kind of consistent excellence that suggested Patterson had figured out Stableford golf after two years of struggling.

Round 1's 46 points built a 4-point lead over Gregg. Round 2's 42 extended it to 8. Round 3's 39 pushed it to 9. By Round 4, Patterson was cruisingâ€”his 45-point finale sealed a 10-point victory over Gregg Williams (162).

One hundred seventy-two points placed Patterson third on the all-time list behind only Alex's 184 and Gregg's 173. Led for 48 of 72 holes. Won Rounds 1 and 4. This wasn't luckyâ€”this was dominant.

From zero birdies and a wooden spoon at TEG 10 to trophy winner at TEG 12. Patterson's redemption arc was complete.

## The Second Eagle in TEG History

Hole 15, Round 4, Aphrodite Hills Golf Club. Stuart Neumann stepped up to a par 5, holed his second shot, and scored eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. Only the second eagle in 12 tournaments.

The first eagle came at TEG 4 when Jon Baker holed a par 4. Eight tournaments and 576 holes later, Stuartmatched it with a par 5 eagle in the final round when the tournament was already decided. Eagles are extraordinarily rare in TEGâ€”only four have been scored across 17 tournamentsâ€”making Stu's achievement historic regardless of context.

Stuartfinished third with 155 points, 17 behind Patterson. That eagle on Hole 15 counted for 5 Stableford points and a permanent place in TEG history. Sometimes you don't need to win to achieve something memorable.

## Jon's Second Jacket from Fourth Place

Jon Baker finished fourth in Stableford with 145 points and won his second consecutive Green Jacket with 63 strokes over par. This is the David Mullin paradox transplanted: finish mid-table in Stableford, dominate gross, collect hardware.

Jon led 58 of 72 holes in gross, won all four rounds, finished 8 strokes clear of David. His Round 4 performance at PGA Catalunya Stadium set the course record at 17 over parâ€”a mark that still stands. The gross competition was never in doubt. The Stableford competition saw Jon finish 27 points behind Patterson in fourth place.

Two consecutive Green Jackets. Both won from outside the Stableford top three. Jon had mastered the art of simultaneous excellence (Gross) and mediocrity (Stableford).

## David's Second Wooden Spoon

David Mullin collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 139 Stableford points, finishing sixth and last. After nine Green Jackets, David had now earned back-to-back wooden spoons. The fall from grace was complete.

The gross consolation: second place, 8 strokes behind Jon. David won zero gross rounds (Jon won all four), led for 3 holes total, never threatened. The dynasty that had dominated nine tournaments was thoroughly extinguished.

One hundred thirty-nine points marked David's second-worst Stableford performance ever (125 at TEG 11 was worse). Back-to-back wooden spoons. Second in gross both times. David had become golf's ultimate paradox: simultaneously terrible (Stableford) and competent (Gross).

## Gregg's Lead That Vanished

Gregg Williams led for 33 holes across the first two rounds, posted 162 points (tied for 4th best ever), and still finished 10 points behind Patterson. Led after Round 2 by 8 points over Stuart, then watched Patterson extend his own lead while Gregg faded.

Forty-two, 38, 38, 44 across four rounds. Consistent, solid, insufficient. Gregg never won a round. Never seriously threatened Patterson after Round 2. Runner-up by 10 points despite posting what would've won most tournaments.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Patterson's 46 leads, Gregg 42, Jon 38, Stuart37, Alex 35, David 33

**Round 2:** Patterson 88 (extends to +8), Gregg 80 (2nd), Stuart76, Jon 74, Alex 70, David 66 (WS brewing)

**Round 3:** Patterson 127 (dominates by +9), Gregg 118, Jon 108, Stuart106, Alex 103, David 100 (WS confirmed)

**Round 4:** Patterson 172 (seals it by 10), Gregg 162, Stuart155 (EAGLE on H15!), Jon 145, Alex 143, David 139 (WS secured)

## The Verdict

TEG 12 delivered Patterson's redemption (172 points, won by 10), Stuart's historic eagle (only the 2nd ever), and Jon's second consecutive Green Jacket from fourth place in Stableford. David collected his second consecutive wooden spoon, finishing last in Stableford and second in gross.

Patterson's 172 points ranked third all-time. Stu's par 5 eagle on Hole 15 joined Jon's TEG 4 eagle as the only two in 12 tournaments. Jon's wire-to-wire gross dominance (led 58/72 holes) secured his second jacket.

Gregg's runner-up (162 points, led 33 holes) was brilliant but insufficient. Alex's fifth place (143 points) and David's wooden spoon (139 points) completed the field.

Patterson's redemption arc: wooden spoon to trophy winner in two years. Stu's eagle: history made. Jon's paradox: fourth in Stableford, first in gross. David's decline: second consecutive last place.
