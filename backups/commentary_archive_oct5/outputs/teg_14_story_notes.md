# TEG 14 Story Notes

## Location & Venue
- **SECOND CONSECUTIVE UK TEG** - Kent, England (same region as TEG 13)
- **COVID-19 Context Continues** - Back-to-back UK years due to travel restrictions

- **One year later, same place** - Unusual repeat location necessitated by pandemic

### Kent Links (Second Year)
**Royal Cinque Ports** (R1) - Historic Open venue. Record: 13 over par (Jon Baker, TEG 13 R1)
**Littlestone** (R2) - Traditional links. Record: 8 over par (Jon Baker, TEG 13 R3)
**Prince's - Shore/Dunes** (R3, R4) - Repeat routing. Record: 11 over par (Jon Baker, THIS tournament R4!)

## Key Points
- **THE GREAT REVERSAL:** David wins Double (154 pts + 58 strokes), Jon gets wooden spoon (125 pts)
