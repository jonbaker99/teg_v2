# TEG 2 Tournament Report: The 18th Hole Massacre

**Boavista Golf Course, Lagos, Algarve, Portugal | May 2009**
**The First Codified TEG - Official Records Begin**

The 18th hole at Boavista—Howard Swan's par-71 championship design overlooking the Monchique hills and Algarve coastline (course record: 4 over par, David Mullin TEG 10 R1)—had witnessed its share of golfing calamities over the years, but nothing quite prepared it for the synchronized implosion of Round 2. David Mullin, Gregg Williams, and Jon Baker—three grown men, three separate golf balls, three simultaneous triple bogeys or worse. Zero Stableford points each. It was the kind of collective meltdown usually reserved for bank runs or boy bands, not individual sporting contests.

And yet, by the time the dust settled on TEG 2 at what would become the spiritual home of the tournament, it was David who stood triumphant with both trophies clutched in his northern hands, having recovered from that 18th hole horror show to claim his first TEG Trophy and Green Jacket with the kind of ruthless efficiency that would become his calling card.

## The 18th Hole Massacre

Let's address the elephant in the room, or rather, the three elephants simultaneously drowning on the 18th green of Round 2. David, Gregg, and Jon—three experienced golfers, one par-4, three triple bogeys or worse. The probability of such synchronised incompetence must approach lottery-winning territory, except instead of millions of pounds, they each won precisely zero Stableford points.

It was beautiful, in the way a multi-car pileup has a certain terrible magnificence. One disaster you can forgive. Two suggests bad luck. Three? That's a statistical anomaly that deserves its own chapter in the annals of golfing futility. The hole should have a plaque.

## David's Wire-to-Wire (Sort Of)

David's victory was never quite as comfortable as the final 5-point margin suggests. His opening 36 points—featuring 22 on the front nine and two actual birdies—established control with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Jon sat 3 points back, the rest were already playing for minor honours, and Henry was experiencing five consecutive triple bogeys that would have broken lesser men.

Then came Round 2 and Jon's spectacular 37-point surge, featuring a front nine that posted 24 points and briefly suggested David might not have things all his own way. Jon led by 5. David sat second, nursing wounded pride and, presumably, trauma from that 18th hole disaster.

The final round was pure David: 38 points of metronomic precision, perfectly balanced (19 front, 19 back), zero triple bogeys, zero drama. While Jon imploded with 28 points and six catastrophic holes, David simply played golf and collected his first TEG Trophy like a man picking up dry cleaning.

## The Wooden Spoon Irony

Henry Meller's wooden spoon came with 75 points and 14 triple bogeys, including that memorable five-hole sequence of disaster in Round 1. The cruel twist? He finished third in gross scoring. Last in Stableford, third in strokes. Golf's dual scoring systems have rarely delivered such a beautiful contradiction.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** David (36) seized control; Jon (33) threatened; Henry's five consecutive triple bogeys (holes 11-15) wrote the wooden spoon script early.

**Round 2:** Jon's brilliant 37-point surge took the lead; the 18th hole claimed three victims simultaneously; David (29) stayed close.

**Round 3:** David's perfect 38-point response sealed it; Jon's six-triple-bogey meltdown (28 points) ended his challenge; Stu's 33 points came too late to matter.

## The Verdict

David Mullin's first TEG Trophy arrived with all the drama of a final-round recovery from disaster, minus the actual disaster. His 103 points and 11-stroke gross victory proved that when you can survive a synchronized 18th hole meltdown and still win by 5 points, you're probably doing something right.

Jon's 98 points and second place told the tale of what might have been. Stu's bronze (89) was workmanlike. Gregg (86) struggled throughout. And Henry proved you can finish last and third simultaneously—a feat that deserves its own trophy, possibly made of wood.

Five players, three rounds at Boavista's Resort and Country sections, and one hole that will live in infamy. Golf remains the only sport where three people can fail identically and spectacularly, yet only one can win. David mastered that particular truth at what was becoming TEG's home course, establishing the early Boavista era that would define the tournament's identity.
