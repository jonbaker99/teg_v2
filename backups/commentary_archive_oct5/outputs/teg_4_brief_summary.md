# TEG 4 - Brief Summary

David Mullin claimed both the TEG Trophy and Green Jacket at Ashdown Forest, finishing with 137 Stableford points—5 clear of defending champion Jon Baker—and a 4-stroke gross victory. After sharing the Round 1 lead with Jon (both on 33 points), David briefly surrendered control when Jon's 37-point Round 2 opened a 4-point gap, but struck back decisively in Round 3 with 36 points to reclaim the lead and sealed victory with a professional 34-point finale.

TEG 4 will be remembered for producing the first eagle in TEG history: Jon Baker holed a par 4 on Hole 8 of Round 4 (worth 5 Stableford points). Eagles remain extraordinarily rare—only four have been scored across 17 tournaments—making Jon's achievement historic despite finishing second with 132 points.

Henry Meller claimed bronze with 132 points (featuring four birdies across the tournament), while Stuart Neumann's 121 points secured fourth. Gregg Williams collected his first wooden spoon with 114 points after a challenging week that included nine triple bogeys.

David's third consecutive Green Jacket and second TEG Trophy cemented his status as TEG's ultimate grinder—precision golf that wears opponents down through sheer mistake-free accumulation. Ashdown Forest had hosted its first TEG; David had claimed his fourth trophy in three tournaments.
