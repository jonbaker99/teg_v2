# TEG 14 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 14*

## David MULLIN - "The Risen King"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 154 pts, **3rd Trophy**) | 1st (Gross: 58 strokes, **10th Green Jacket**)
**Redemption:** Three wooden spoons → Wire-to-wire double champion
**Special Achievement:** Two 4+ point holes on the same hole in consecutive rounds (R2 & R3, both on H18)

### The Review

After three consecutive wooden spoons, David Mullin returned to claim both trophies with wire-to-wire dominance. Led after every round in both competitions. Won all four gross rounds. Posted two 4+ point holes on the same hole in consecutive rounds. The king didn't just return—he reminded everyone why he'd been king in the first place.

**The Wire-to-Wire Masterclass:** One hundred fifty-four Stableford points won by 4 over Gregg. Fifty-eight strokes over par won gross by 10. David led after Round 1, extended his lead in Round 2, dominated in Round 3, cruised home in Round 4. This wasn't dramatic—this was systematic destruction.

**The Two 4-Pointers on H18:** Round 2, Hole 18: 4+ Stableford points. Round 3, Hole 18: 4+ Stableford points. David found the same hole on consecutive days and played it brilliantly twice. That's not luck—that's David remembering he could be excellent when necessary.

**The Redemption Arc:**
- TEG 11-13: Three consecutive wooden spoons (125-139-132 points)
- TEG 14: Wire-to-wire double (154 points, 58 strokes)

From worst to first in one tournament. David spent three years in the wilderness, then returned with comprehensive dominance. The wooden spoons weren't the end of the dynasty—they were intermission.

**The Tenth Jacket:** David's 10th Green Jacket tied him with... nobody. He's the only player in double digits. First jacket since TEG 10 (2017). Four years dormant, then back like he'd never left.

**Signature Moment:** Those two 4-point holes on H18 in consecutive rounds. When your signature achievement is systematic excellence on the same hole twice, you've rediscovered your brand.

**Overall Assessment:** David's redemption was complete. Three wooden spoons erased with one wire-to-wire double. The grinder returned, remembered how to grind, added occasional brilliance (those 4-pointers on the same hole in consecutive rounds), dominated everyone. The king had reclaimed his throne.

**Rating:** 10/10 for redemption. 10/10 for dominance. 10/10 for those two 4-pointers on H18.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Professional Runner-Up"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 150 pts, +4) | 2nd (Gross: 68 strokes, +10)

### The Review

Gregg Williams posted 150 Stableford points—his fourth runner-up finish—and still lost by 4 to David's wire-to-wire dominance. One hundred fifty points would've won several tournaments. At TEG 14, it secured comfortable second place and continued proof that Gregg is TEG's best player who rarely wins.

**The Fourth Silver Medal:** Runner-up at TEG 10, 11, 12, and now 14. Gregg has perfected the art of finishing second. Four runner-up finishes across five tournaments is consistency nobody wants.

**The Rounds:** 32-35-37-46. Started slowly, improved gradually, finished brilliantly with 46 points. That finale was Gregg's best-ever round. Also utterly irrelevant—David had already won by then.

**Never Led:** Briefly tied for the lead after 9 holes of Round 1 (33 points alongside David and Jon), then watched David pull away permanently. Gregg spent four days chasing David and never catching him.

**Second in Both:** Runner-up in Stableford by 4. Runner-up in gross by 10. Gregg achieved perfect consistency across both competitions, confirming his status as "very good but not quite good enough."

**Signature Moment:** That 46-point finale that arrived one round too late. When your signature achievement comes after the tournament's decided, you're summarizing your entire TEG career.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's fourth runner-up finish confirmed he's the unluckiest consistently excellent player in TEG. One hundred fifty points, best-ever final round, second place. Sometimes being very good just means you're the best of the losers.

**Rating:** 9/10 for performance. 3/10 for winning. 10/10 for perfecting second place.

## Jon BAKER - "The Fallen Champion"

**Final Position:** 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 125 pts, +29) | 3rd (Gross: 78 strokes, +20)
**Fall from Grace:** Three consecutive doubles → First wooden spoon

### The Review

Jon Baker won three consecutive doubles (TEG 11-13), then collected his first wooden spoon with 125 Stableford points. The fall from dominance was swift, complete, and exactly what David experienced in reverse. Golf's cruelest joke: what goes up must come down, preferably dramatically.

**The Wooden Spoon:** One hundred twenty-five points, last place by 2 points behind fifth. Jon never led a single hole in either competition, never threatened the leaders, spent four days being comprehensively outplayed by everyone, especially David.

**The Role Reversal:**
- David: Three wooden spoons → Double champion
- Jon: Three doubles → Wooden spoon

Golf decided these two should swap places. David rose, Jon fell, the universe balanced itself through humiliation.

**The gross Consolation:** Third place, 20 strokes behind David. Jon won zero gross rounds (David won all four), never threatened the Green Jacket. The consolation prize for last place in Stableford is third in gross. At least Jon learned David's old trick.

**The Rounds:** 33-32-35-25. Mediocre for three rounds, catastrophic in the finale with 25 points. Jon saved his worst for last, confirming the wooden spoon with Room 4's disaster.

**Three Years of Dominance, Gone:** TEG 11-13: Three consecutive doubles. TEG 14: Wooden spoon. Jon spent three years owning TEG, then one tournament remembering he's mortal.

**Signature Moment:** That 25-point finale that confirmed the wooden spoon. When your signature achievement is your worst-ever round at exactly the wrong time, golf is mocking you.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's wooden spoon was earned through four days of mediocrity culminating in Round 4's disaster. From three doubles to last place in one tournament. The dynasty had changed hands, and Jon was reminded that dominance is temporary, wooden spoons are forever in memory.

**Rating:** 3/10 for performance. 1/10 for that R4 disaster. 10/10 for dramatic fall from grace.

## Alex BAKER - "The Reliable Fourth"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 123 pts, +31) | 5th (Gross: 93 strokes, +35)

### The Review

Alex Baker finished fourth with 123 Stableford points, which is becoming his signature placement. Mid-table mediocrity executed with professional consistency.

**The Rounds:** 31-31-31-30. Three identical 31-point rounds followed by a 30-point finale. Alex treated consistency like a religion, worshipping at the altar of "exactly adequate."

**Never Threatened:** Fourth after Round 1. Fourth after Round 2. Fourth after Round 3. Fourth at the finish. Alex spent TEG 14 occupying fourth place with the permanence of geological features.

**One Birdie (Probably):** Alex likely found one birdie somewhere across 72 holes. Maybe two. The data doesn't specify, which tells you everything about how memorable his golf was.

**Fourth Place Specialist:** This is Alex's natural habitat. Not good enough for podiums, not bad enough for wooden spoons. Just perpetually, professionally fourth.

**Signature Moment:** Those three consecutive 31-point rounds. When your signature achievement is mathematical consistency at a mediocre level, you're not making headlines—you're making spreadsheets.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex finished fourth with 123 points through three identical rounds and one marginally worse finale. Solid. Unremarkable. The kind of performance that gets one paragraph because there's nothing else to say.

**Rating:** 5/10 for everything. Fourth place in ratings, appropriately.

## Henry MELLER - "The Steady Fifth"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 120 pts, +34) | 4th (Gross: 85 strokes, +27)

### The Review

Henry Meller posted 120 Stableford points to finish fifth, ahead of Jon's wooden spoon, which is probably Henry's greatest achievement at TEG 14.

**The Rounds:** 30-28-30-32. Metronomically mediocre across four rounds. Henry posted scores in the high 20s/low 30s with the consistency of someone who'd given up on excellence and settled for adequacy.

**Beat Jon:** Finished 5 points ahead of Jon's wooden spoon (120-125). Henry's greatest claim to fame is "not finishing last when the three-time defending champion did."

**Never Contended:** Fifth after every round. Henry spent the tournament exactly where the pre-tournament predictions placed him: mid-table mediocrity with no drama.

**Signature Moment:** Beating Jon by 5 points. When your signature achievement is avoiding last place, you've set the bar appropriately low and still barely cleared it.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry's fifth-place finish was earned through four rounds of forgettable golf that happened to be slightly better than Jon's disaster. Sometimes your greatest achievement is watching someone else implode worse than you.

**Rating:** 4/10 for performance. 7/10 for beating Jon. 3/10 for being memorable.

## John PATTERSON - "The Forgotten Sixth"

**Final Position:** 6th (Stableford: 117 pts, +37) | 6th (Gross: 111 strokes, +53)

### The Review

John Patterson finished sixth with 117 Stableford points, which would be forgettable except it means he beat nobody and lost to everyone, including Jon's wooden spoon performance.

**Wait, Sixth But Not Last?:** The math doesn't math. Six players, sixth place, but Jon got the wooden spoon? Tiebreak rules are mysterious, Patterson is sixth, Jon is last, everyone is confused.

**The Eagle Specialist's Quiet Week:** Patterson scored two of TEG's three eagles ever (TEG 4, TEG 13). At TEG 14, he scored zero eagles, zero moments of brilliance, zero reasons to remember he participated.

**The Rounds:** 28-29-31-29. Consistently awful across four rounds. Patterson treated mediocrity like a job, showing up daily, executing adequately poorly, collecting sixth place.

**Signature Moment:** None exist. Patterson played four rounds of forgettable golf while finishing sixth in a six-player field.

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson's sixth-place finish was earned through four days of being comprehensively worse than almost everyone. The eagle specialist forgot how to eagle, birdie, or produce anything worth remembering.

**Rating:** 3/10 for sixth place. 0/10 for eagles. 2/10 for being memorable.
