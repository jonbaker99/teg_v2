# TEG 17 - Player Profiles

---

## Jon BAKER - 1st (Stableford: 166 pts) | 1st (Gross: 67 strokes)

Jon Baker approached TEG 17 with all the dramatic flair of someone filling out a spreadsheet. And much like a well-formatted Excel document, his performance was methodical, consistent, and about as exciting as watching cells auto-populate.

**The Numbers:** Led for 67 of 72 holes (Stableford) and 70 of 72 (Gross). That's not dominance; that's occupation. Baker didn't win TEG 17 so much as annex it, plant a flag, and issue building permits.

**Round Progression:** 38-44-44-40 Stableford points. The kind of consistency that makes accountants weep with joy. Five birdies, 34 bogeys, six doubles. These are not the numbers of golf's great entertainers. These are the numbers of someone who read the assignment, understood the assignment, and executed the assignment with the passion of a tax return.

## David MULLIN - 2nd (Stableford: 148 pts, +18) | 2nd (Gross: 80 strokes, +13)

David Mullin spent TEG 17 proving that you can produce a moment of absolute brilliance and still finish as the bridesmaid. Again.

**The Glorious Moment:** Round 2 at West Cliffsâ€”47 Stableford points. Forty. Seven. Three birdies. The round of the tournament by approximately one country mile. For 18 holes, Mullin played golf that suggested he might actually trouble Baker's procession.

**The Reality Check:** Those 47 points earned him second place. By 18 points. That's the golfing equivalent of scoring a hat-trick and still losing 5-1.

## John PATTERSON - 3rd= (Stableford: 135 pts, +31) | 4th (Gross: 124 strokes, +57)

John Patterson's TEG 17 can be neatly divided into two categories: "That was surprisingly good" and "Oh dear God, what happened?"

**The Promise:** Round 1 was gloriousâ€”39 Stableford points, leading the tournament, playing golf that suggested he might actually have a say in proceedings. For one round, Patterson was a contender.

**The Catastrophe:** Round 2 was... less glorious. Twenty-two Stableford points. Nine holes of triple-bogey-or-worse carnage. A 44 gross score that suggested he'd perhaps mistaken West Cliffs for a minigolf course and was dismayed to discover real bunkers.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 5th (Stableford: 123 pts, +43, **Wooden Spoon**) | 3rd (Gross: 89 strokes, +22)

Gregg Williams accomplished something truly special at TEG 17: finishing third in one competition while simultaneously claiming last place in the other. This is golf's version of quantum physicsâ€”existing in two states simultaneously, both of them confusing.

**The gross Story:** Williams posted 89 strokes, good enough for bronze. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that suggests competence.

**The Stableford Story:** Williams posted 123 points, comfortably last, earning him the Wooden Spoon. The kind of performance that suggests someone forgot how Stableford scoring works.

## Alex BAKER - 3rd= (Stableford: 135 pts, +31) | 5th (Gross: 150 strokes, +83)

Alex Baker's TEG 17 performance can be summarized in one word: present. He was there. He played golf. Things happened, none of them particularly noteworthy.

**The Numbers:** 32-37-34-32 Stableford across four rounds. That's not consistency; that's a straight line. Baker played with the excitement of someone reading terms and conditions. Thoroughly. Twice.

**Round 1, Hole 18:** Quintuple bogey or worse. Baker opened his tournament by discovering that the first hole 18 can, in fact, accept scores so high they require scientific notation. It set the tone for a week of "well, at least it's not Round 1, Hole 18."
