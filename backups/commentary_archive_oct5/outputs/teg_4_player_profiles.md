# TEG 4 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 4*

---

## David MULLIN - "The Double Agent"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 137 pts) | 1st (Gross: wins by 4 strokes, **Green Jacket**)

### The Review

David Mullin arrived at Ashdown Forest and proceeded to demonstrate that winning both trophies doesn't require excitementâ€”just the ability to not lose when it matters.

**The Opening:** Tied with Jon at 33 points in Round 1. Uninspiring? Absolutely. Effective? Eventually.

**The Wobble:** Round 2 saw Jon surge past with 37 points while David posted 34. For a brief moment, David was second. The horror. The indignity. The... temporary inconvenience.

**The Response:** Round 3: 36 points to Jon's 34. Lead reclaimed. Trophy trajectory: back on track. David doesn't panic; David adjusts. Like a thermostat, but less interesting.

**The Seal:** Round 4's 34 points sealed the 5-point victory. Professional. Clinical. About as thrilling as watching grass become slightly longer grass.

**The Green Jacket:** Third consecutive. Led wire-to-wire in gross, won by 4 strokes. Zero birdies? Probably. Zero drama? Definitely. Zero apologies? David doesn't do those.

**Signature Moment:** Reclaiming the lead in R3 after Jon's brief coup. When your signature moment is "regaining what you briefly lost," you're David Mullin.

**Overall Assessment:** David's fourth trophy in three tournaments arrived via his patented formula: grind, bore, win. Second TEG Trophy, third Green Jacket, maximum efficiency, minimum entertainment. The accountant's dream golfer continues his reign.

**Rating:** 10/10 for winning. 2/10 for excitement. 10/10 for proving defending champions can be dethroned by... David.

## Jon BAKER - "The Historic Runner-Up"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 132 pts, +5) | 3rd (Gross: +6 strokes)
**Historic Achievement:** THE FIRST EVER TEG EAGLE (R4, H8, Par 4)

### The Review

Jon Baker spent TEG 4 learning a valuable lesson: defending titles is hard. Winning them back from David is harder. Probably impossible, actually. But sometimes you lose the tournament and still make history.

**The Start:** Tied with David at 33 points. So far, so good. Championship defense looking solid. Trophy cabinet space: still reserved.

**The Surge:** Round 2's 37 pointsâ€”BRILLIANT. Led by 4 points. The trophy was visible. The champagne was chilling. Jon was back, baby!

**The Reality Check:** Round 3: 34 points while David posted 36. Lead gone. Trophy dreams: fading. Champagne: getting warm. Jon: discovering that David doesn't stay down.

**The Historic Moment:** Round 4, Hole 8, Bletchingley Golf Club. Par 4. Jon holed his approach for eagleâ€”THE FIRST EAGLE IN TEG HISTORY. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. Eagles are so rare in TEG (only 4 in 17 tournaments) that this moment transcends Jon's second-place finish.

**The Finale:** Round 4's 33 points (including that historic eagle) was respectable. Also insufficient. David posted 34 and walked away with both trophies while Jon contemplated the cruelty of making history while losing.

**The Math:** Lost by 5. But scored the first eagle ever. Some consolation prizes actually matter.

**Signature Moment:** That eagle on Hole 8. The defending champion lost his crown but claimed something rarerâ€”a genuine piece of TEG history that only three other players would ever match across 17 tournaments.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's title defense failed, but he'll always be the answer to "Who scored the first TEG eagle?" Sometimes losing memorably beats winning forgettably.

**Rating:** 8/10 for R2. 10/10 for that eagle. 5/10 for title defense. 2/10 for stopping David (impossible task).

## Henry MELLER - "The Birdie Collector"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 132 pts, +5) | 5th (Gross)

### The Review

Henry Meller collected bronze with 132 points by doing what Henry does best: hitting birdies that ultimately don't matter.

**The Birdie Count:** Four. FOUR. Henry was out here collecting birdies like PokÃ©mon cards while David was collecting trophies with zero birdies. The lesson is clear: golf rewards boring over brilliant.

**Round 2 Glory:** Thirty-six points including three birdies. Best round until that point. Thrilling golf that lifted Henry to... third place. Where he stayed. Forever.

**The Reality:** One hundred thirty-two points. Same as Jon's second-place score. Except Jon finished second and Henry third because... golf. Cruel, arbitrary golf.

**The Irony:** Four birdies, bronze medal. David probably had zero birdies and won both trophies. The universe has a wicked sense of humor.

**Signature Moment:** That Round 2 with three birdies. When your signature achievement is "best round that changed nothing," you're Henry Meller.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry played entertaining golf and finished third. David played boring golf and won everything. Lesson learned: save your birdies for tournaments David doesn't enter.

**Rating:** 7/10 for entertainment. 6/10 for results. 10/10 for proving birdies are overrated (again).

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Fourth Man"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 121 pts, +16) | 2nd (Gross: +4 strokes)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann finished fourth with 121 points through the simple strategy of being present and mostly competent.

**The Rounds:** 27-33-30-31. That's not a progression; that's a random number generator with a bias toward low 30s. Stuartplayed golf like someone who'd read the rulebook but skipped the chapter on "winning."

**The gross Surprise:** Second place! Four strokes behind David. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that makes people say "good for you" while secretly trying to remember your name.

**The Paradox Lite:** Fourth in Stableford, second in gross. Not quite as dramatic as being last and second (Stu's TEG 3 achievement), but still evidence that golf's scoring systems are having a laugh.

**Signature Moment:** Finishing second in gross while fourth in Stableford. When your signature achievement is "confusing scoring systems," you're StuartNeumann.

**Overall Assessment:** Stuartdelivered exactly what Stuartalways delivers: professional mediocrity with occasional flashes of gross scoring competence. Fourth place, second in gross, zero chance of winning. The StuartNeumann guarantee.

**Rating:** 5/10 for Stableford. 7/10 for gross. 3/10 for threatening to win anything.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Triple Bogey King"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 114 pts, +23) | 5th (Gross)

### The Review

Gregg Williams claimed his first wooden spoon with 114 points and nine triple bogeys, proving that commitment to disaster eventually gets rewarded.

**The Opening Statement:** Round 1: 24 points, four triple bogeys. Gregg opened his tournament by demonstrating every possible way to implode. It was comprehensive. It was thorough. It was catastrophic.

**The Acceleration:** Round 2: 29 points, FIVE triple bogeys. FIVE. That's not golf; that's a cry for help. Gregg had nine triple bogeys through two rounds. NINE. By this point, the wooden spoon wasn't coming; it was already gift-wrapped with his name on it.

**The Sad Recovery:** Rounds 3 and 4 posted 30-31 points each. Marginally less terrible. Still last. Too late to matter. Gregg had presumably exhausted every way to disaster and settled for mere incompetence.

**The Math:** One hundred fourteen points. Twenty-three behind David. Nine triple bogeys total. Last in both competitionsâ€”the rare double disappointment.

**Signature Moment:** Nine triple bogeys in four rounds. When your signature achievement is finding nine different ways to implode, you deserve the wooden spoon and possibly counseling.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's first wooden spoon was earned through dedication to disaster. Nine triple bogeys. Last in everything. A comprehensive commitment to catastrophe that actually becomes impressive after a while. Not good impressive. But impressive.

**Rating:** 2/10 for performance. 1/10 for consistency (consistently terrible). 10/10 for earning that wooden spoon.
