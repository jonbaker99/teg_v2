# TEG 7 - Brief Summary

Henry Meller claimed his first and only TEG Trophy at Praia D'El Rey with a dominant 175-point wire-to-wire victory, winning by 5 points over joint runners-up David Mullin and Gregg Williams (both 170). Henry's triumph was built on a devastating opening blitz—49 points in Round 1, then a staggering 51 in Round 2—that created a 19-point cushion through 36 holes. Though he declined to 37 and 38 points in the final two rounds, the early lead proved insurmountable.

David and Gregg both finished on 170 points, with David collecting his sixth consecutive Green Jacket despite sharing second place. Stuart Neumann's fourth-place finish (169 points) left him agonizingly one point from the joint second, while Jon Baker's 164 points secured fifth. The tournament marked Alex Baker's TEG debut, which he celebrated by immediately collecting the wooden spoon with 152 points—23 behind Henry's winning total.

Henry's only TEG Trophy was earned through spectacular early dominance followed by managed survival. One hundred points in two rounds built the foundation for a victory that would stand as his career highlight—the one shining moment when Henry Meller was TEG champion.
