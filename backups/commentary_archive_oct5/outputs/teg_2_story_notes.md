### About Boavista
Championship par-71 course near Lagos designed by Howard Swan. Features two distinctive sections: Resort (holes 1-3, 13-18) and Country (holes 4-12). Known for spectacular views of Monchique hills and Algarve coastline, with signature par-4 7th hole overlooking the Atlantic. Immaculate fairways with water features on holes 14, 15, and 17.

**Course Record (Gross):** 4 over par - David Mullin (TEG 10, R1)

## Main Talking Points

### üéØ Primary Storyline
- **David's First Double:** First TEG Trophy + Green Jacket (103 pts, 66 strokes)
- **The 18th Hole Massacre:** Round 2 - THREE players (David, Gregg, Jon) all triple bogey or worse on same hole. All score zero Stableford points simultaneously. Statistical anomaly. Beautiful blow-up.
- **Jon's Near Miss:** Led after R2 with brilliant 37 pts (24-pt front 9!), then imploded R3 with 28 pts and 6 triple bogeys

### üèÜ Competition Results
- **TEG Trophy:** David (103) by 5 over Jon (98)
- **Green Jacket:** David (66) by 11 over Stuart(77)
- **Wooden Spoon:** Henry (75) - BUT finished 3rd in gross! The paradox.

### üìä Round-by-Round
1. **R1:** David 36 (leads), Jon 33, Henry's 5 consecutive triple bogeys (h11-15)
2. **R2:** Jon's 37-pt surge takes lead, THE 18TH HOLE DISASTER, David 29 stays close
3. **R3:** David's perfect 38 (19 front, 19 back, zero triples) seals it, Jon's 6-triple meltdown

### üíé Key Moments
- **18th hole R2:** Three simultaneous blow-ups - "beautiful multi-car pileup"
- **Henry's horror:** 5 consecutive triple bogeys R1
- **Jon's front 9 R2:** 24 Stableford points - spectacular
- **David's R3:** Perfect balance, zero blow-ups, championship response

### üé≠ Player Stories

**David:**
- First titles, established his grinder reputation
- Survived the 18th hole blow-up to win by 5
- 2 birdies all tournament, won on consistency
- "Picking up dry cleaning" - zero drama

**Jon:**
- Round 2 hero (37 pts, esp that 24-pt front 9)
- Round 3 villain (28 pts, 6 triples, 9-hole blow-up streak)
- The souffl√© - spectacular rise, dramatic collapse
- 98 pts, haunted by "what if"

**Henry:**
- First wooden spoon (75 pts)
- The paradox: Last in Stableford, 3rd in gross
- Five consecutive triple bogeys R1 = instant wooden spoon
- "Deserves its own trophy, possibly made of wood"

**Stu:**
- Mr. Consistent: 27, 29, 33 rounds
- 2nd in gross (77), bronze in Stableford (89)
- The reliable one, R3 birdie too late

**Gregg:**
