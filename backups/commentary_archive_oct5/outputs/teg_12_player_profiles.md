*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 12*

## John PATTERSON - "The Redeemed"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 172 pts, **3rd best ever**) | 4th (Gross: 96 strokes, +33)
**Redemption Arc:** Wooden spoon (TEG 10) → 4th (TEG 11) → Trophy (TEG 12)

### The Review

Two years after collecting the wooden spoon with zero birdies and 112 points, John Patterson posted 172 Stableford points—the third-best score in TEG history—to win his second trophy. This is golf's version of a comeback album that actually delivers.

**The Opening Statement:** Forty-six Stableford points in Round 1. Patterson's best-ever round opened a 4-point lead and announced "I remembered how to play golf." After two years of struggle, that 46 was redemption distilled to 18 holes.

**The Consistency:** 46-42-39-45. Started brilliantly, stayed brilliantly, finished brilliantly. Patterson led after every round, won Rounds 1 and 4, and made the tournament look easy. Led for 48 of 72 holes. Won by 10 points. This wasn't luck—this was dominance.

**Historical Context:** One hundred seventy-two points ranked third all-time behind only Alex's 184 and Gregg's 173. Patterson joined elite company by posting a score that would've won almost any tournament in TEG history.

**The Redemption Timeline:**
- TEG 10: Wooden spoon, 112 points, zero birdies
- TEG 11: Fourth place, 135 points, zero birdies
- TEG 12: Trophy, 172 points, best-ever performance

That's not just improvement—that's narrative arc. Patterson went from worst to first in two years, proving wooden spoons aren't destiny.

**Signature Moment:** That 46-point opening round that built a lead he never surrendered. When your signature achievement wins you a trophy, you've had a perfect week.

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson's redemption was complete. From zero birdies and last place to 172 points and championship. Sometimes the story writes itself, and sometimes you write it with four rounds of brilliant golf.

**Rating:** 10/10 for performance. 10/10 for redemption arc. 10/10 for proving comebacks exist.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Nearly Man (Again)"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 162 pts, +10) | 3rd (Gross: 76 strokes, +13)

### The Review

Gregg Williams posted 162 Stableford points—tied for the fourth-best score ever—led for 33 holes, and still finished 10 points behind Patterson. This is becoming Gregg's signature: play brilliantly, lose to someone playing more brilliantly.

**The Early Lead:** Led after Round 2 with 80 points, 8 ahead of Stuart, looking like someone who might win his second Trophy. Then Patterson stayed Patterson, and Gregg's lead evaporated into "briefly competitive."

**The Rounds:** 42-38-38-44. Opened strong, maintained competently, finished strongly. Gregg never collapsed, never faded dramatically. He just couldn't match Patterson's relentless accumulation of points.

**Never Won a Round:** Finished 2nd in Round 1, 3rd in Round 2, 3rd in Round 3, 2nd in Round 4. Gregg spent four days being second or third-best, which is impressive consistency and also how you finish runner-up.

**The Led-33-Holes Statistic:** Gregg led for 33 holes across the first two rounds, then watched Patterson extend his lead while Gregg faded to 10 points back. Leading early is nice. Leading at the end matters.

**Signature Moment:** That Round 2 lead that lasted exactly until Patterson posted better scores in Rounds 3 and 4. When your signature moment is "led midway through," you're not winning championships.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's 162 points would've won most tournaments. At TEG 12, it secured comfortable second place and the knowledge that sometimes your best isn't the best. Runner-up by 10 points with a score that ranks fourth all-time. That's golf's cruelest joke.

**Rating:** 9/10 for performance. 5/10 for timing. 6/10 for accepting silver gracefully (presumably).

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Eagle Man"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 155 pts, +17) | 6th (Gross: 122 strokes, +59)
**Historic Achievement:** THE SECOND EVER TEG EAGLE (R4, H15, Par 5)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 4 for eagle—only the second eagle in 12 tournaments of TEG history. Eight years after Jon Baker's historic first, Stuartmatched it with a par 5 eagle that counted for 5 Stableford points and a permanent place in golf's most exclusive club.

**The Eagle:** Hole 15, Round 4, Aphrodite Hills. Par 5. Stuartholed his second shot for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. Only four eagles have been scored across 17 TEG tournaments, making Stu's achievement extraordinarily rare.

**Historical Context:** Jon Baker scored the first eagle at TEG 4 (par 4, R4 H8). Eight tournaments and 576 holes later, Stuartjoined him with a par 5 eagle. Eagles are so rare in TEG that Stu's achievement transcends his third-place finish.

**The Tournament:** One hundred fifty-five points secured bronze, 17 behind Patterson. Stuartnever led, never threatened the top two, but made history regardless. Led after Round 2 briefly (tied with Jon at 76 points), then faded to third.

**The Rounds:** 37-39-43-36. Solid opening, strong middle, decent finish. The 43-point Round 3 kept Stuartcompetitive. The 36-point finale (including that eagle) confirmed bronze while delivering history.

**The Timing:** The eagle came in Round 4 when the tournament was decided. Patterson had already won. Stuartwas already third. But eagles don't care about context—they're rare regardless of when they arrive.

**Signature Moment:** That par 5 eagle on Hole 15. Stuartwill always be the answer to "Who scored the second TEG eagle?" That's worth more than most bronze medals.

**Overall Assessment:** Stuartfinished third with 155 points and made TEG history with only the second eagle ever. Sometimes you don't need to win to achieve something memorable. Sometimes holing a par 5 from the fairway is enough.

**Rating:** 10/10 for that eagle. 7/10 for bronze. 10/10 for joining golf's most exclusive club.

## Jon BAKER - "The Paradox Master"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 145 pts, +27) | 1st (Gross: 63 strokes, **2nd consecutive Green Jacket**)
**Paradox Achievement:** Won gross from 4th in Stableford (again)

### The Review

Jon Baker finished fourth in Stableford with 145 points and won his second consecutive Green Jacket with 63 strokes over par. This is the David Mullin paradox perfected: dominate one competition while being thoroughly mediocre in the other.

**The gross Dominance:** Led 58 of 72 holes. Won all four rounds. Finished 8 strokes clear of David. The Green Jacket was never in doubt. Jon treated gross golf like a personal fiefdom.

**The Stableford Mediocrity:** Fourth place, 27 points behind Patterson. Jon never led a single hole in Stableford, never threatened the top three, spent four days being professionally forgettable in points while being dominant in strokes.

**Second Consecutive Jacket from Outside Top 3:** TEG 11: First place Stableford, first gross. TEG 12: Fourth Stableford, first gross. Jon has mastered the art of simultaneous excellence and mid-table competence.

**The Efficiency:** Five birdies across four rounds. Jon found birdies more frequently than most, then promptly undermined them with enough bogeys and doubles to finish fourth in Stableford.

**The Paradox Perfected:** Won gross wire-to-wire. Never threatened Stableford. Collected hardware from fourth place. This is David Mullin's legacy transplanted to Jon's career.

**Signature Moment:** Winning his second consecutive Green Jacket from fourth place in Stableford. When your signature achievement is a paradox, you've achieved brand consistency.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's second jacket was earned through wire-to-wire gross dominance while finishing thoroughly mid-table in Stableford. He's perfected the art of doing one thing brilliantly and the other thing adequately. Two jackets, both won from outside the Stableford podium. The paradox is self-sustaining.

**Rating:** 10/10 for gross. 5/10 for Stableford. 10/10 for maintaining the paradox.

## Alex BAKER - "The Forgettable Fifth"

**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 143 pts, +29) | 5th (Gross: 104 strokes, +41)

### The Review

Alex Baker posted 143 Stableford points to finish fifth, which is perfectly respectable and utterly forgettable when someone's scoring 172 and someone else is making the second eagle ever.

**The Rounds:** 35-35-33-40. Alex opened with identical 35-point rounds like someone on autopilot, faded to 33 in Round 3, then rallied with 40 in the finale when the tournament was over. This is the scoring pattern of someone who showed up, participated, achieved nothing memorable.

**Never Threatened:** Fifth after Round 1. Sixth after Round 2. Fifth after Round 3. Fifth at the finish. Alex spent TEG 12 occupying fifth place with the consistency of furniture.

**One Birdie:** Alex found exactly one birdie across 72 holes, which suggests he's familiar with the concept but not particularly committed to execution.

**Fifth in Both:** Bronze in neither competition. Alex achieved perfect mid-table mediocrity across both Stableford and gross. Some players dominate. Some struggle. Alex just... existed.

**Signature Moment:** None. Alex played four rounds of professional mediocrity while more interesting things happened elsewhere.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex finished fifth in a six-player field with 143 points and one birdie. Solid. Unremarkable. The kind of performance that gets summarized in one paragraph because there's nothing else to say.

**Rating:** 5/10 for everything. Literally everything. Alex is golf's version of a participation trophy.

## David MULLIN - "The Wooden Spoon Collector"

**Final Position:** 6th (**2nd consecutive Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 139 pts, +33) | 2nd (Gross: 71 strokes, +8)

### The Review

After nine consecutive Green Jackets, David Mullin collected his second consecutive wooden spoon with 139 Stableford points. Last place again. Second in gross again. The fall from dynasty to disaster was complete.

**Back-to-Back Spoons:** TEG 11: wooden spoon, 125 points. TEG 12: wooden spoon, 139 points. David has now finished last twice in a row after winning nine straight Green Jackets. This is golf's version of a Greek tragedy.

**The Stableford Disaster:** One hundred thirty-nine points, 33 behind Patterson, 4 behind fifth place. David wasn't even close to avoiding last place. He finished sixth in a six-player field by being comprehensively worse than everyone else.

**The gross Consolation:** Second place, 8 strokes behind Jon. David won zero gross rounds (Jon won all four), led for 3 holes total, never threatened. The consolation prize for finishing last in Stableford is finishing second in gross. David has perfected this.

**The Rounds:** 33-33-34-39. Metronomically mediocre for three rounds, then a strong 39-point finale when the wooden spoon was already confirmed. David discovered his form in Round 4, which is when last place is secured, not avoided.

**The Dynasty's Ghost:** Nine Green Jackets (2009-2017). Two wooden spoons (2018-2019). The universe giveth, the universe taketh away with extreme prejudice.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting his second consecutive wooden spoon after nine Green Jackets. When your signature moment is sustained failure after sustained dominance, golf is teaching you humility twice.

**Overall Assessment:** David's second wooden spoon confirmed the dynasty was over. Last in Stableford by 4 points. Second in gross by 8 strokes. Back-to-back spoons after nine jackets. The TEG giveth championships, the TEG taketh away dignity.

**Rating:** 2/10 for Stableford. 6/10 for gross. 10/10 for completing the fall from grace.
