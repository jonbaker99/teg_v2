# TEG 3 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 3*

---

## Jon BAKER - "The Occupation Force"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 164 pts) | 3rd (Gross: 94 strokes, +22)

### The Review

Jon Baker arrived at TEG 3 with a simple plan: lead from start to finish and never, ever have a Round 3 collapse again. Mission accomplished with all the drama of filling out a spreadsheet.

**The Dominance:** Led for 72 consecutive holes. Seventy-two. That's not winning; that's occupation. That's annexation. Jon didn't so much compete as establish a protectorate and issue building permits.

**The Rounds:** 45-41-35-43. That's not a scoring progression; that's a flat line with occasional bumps. Boring? Absolutely. Effective? Devastatingly so. Jon played golf like someone doing their taxesâ€”methodical, accurate, completely devoid of excitement.

**The Margin:** Won by 17 points. Seventeen. The closest David got was 8 points back after Round 1, and Jon's response was basically "cool story bro" before extending it to 17 by the finish.

**Redemption Achieved:** Last year's Round 3 collapse? Erased. This year's strategy? Don't collapse. Revolutionary stuff. Someone should write a book: "How to Win: Simply Don't Implode" by Jon Baker.

**Signature Moment:** Leading wire-to-wire. When your signature moment is "consistent competence for four days straight," you've mastered boring excellence.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's second TEG Trophy was earned through remorseless, spreadsheet-like consistency that made everyone else look like they were playing a different sport. Led every round. Never panicked. Never faltered. Golf's version of watching paint dry, except the paint wins championships.

**Rating:** 10/10 for winning. 1/10 for entertainment. 10/10 for proving boring beats everything.

## David MULLIN - "Mr. Zero Birdies"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 147 pts, +17) | 1st (Gross: 72 strokes, **Green Jacket**)

### The Review

David Mullin spent TEG 3 proving a fundamental truth: you don't need birdies when you simply don't make mistakes. Zero birdies in 72 holes. ZERO. And yet he walked away with his second consecutive Green Jacket.

**The Zero-Birdie Masterclass:** Not a single birdie. Seventy-two holes, zero moments of excitement. While Henry was out there collecting four birdies like some sort of show-off, David was grinding out pars and bogeys with the enthusiasm of an accountant auditing tax returns.

**The gross Dominance:** Seventy-two strokes. Twelve clear of second-placed Stuart. This is David's entire brand: birdies are for show; pars are for dough. Entertainment is optional; winning is mandatory.

**The Stableford Story:** One hundred forty-seven points, 17 behind Jon. Last year David won both trophies. This year he settled for just the Green Jacket while Jon hogged the Stableford glory. Apparently sharing is caring.

**The Rounds:** 37-36-37-37. That's not variety; that's a metronome. David played the same round four times and called it a strategy. It worked. It was boring. But it worked.

**Signature Moment:** Winning the Green Jacket without a single birdie. When your signature achievement is absence of excitement, you're David Mullin.

**Overall Assessment:** David's second consecutive Green Jacket came via pure, uncut grinding. No fireworks. No drama. Just relentless par-saving golf that wears opponents down through sheer competence. Birdies are overrated; David Mullin is not.

**Rating:** 10/10 for Green Jacket. 0/10 for birdies. 10/10 for proving excitement is optional.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Bronze Medalist"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 138 pts, +26) | 5th (Gross: 127 strokes, +55)

### The Review

Gregg Williams claimed bronze with 138 points through the simple strategy of improving each round until he stopped being terrible and settled for merely mediocre.

**The Start:** Round 1 posted 31 points and six triple bogeys. Six. That's not bad luck; that's a personal relationship with disaster. Gregg opened his tournament by demonstrating exactly how not to play golf.

**The Recovery:** Then something miraculous happened: Gregg remembered how to golf. Rounds of 35-36-36 followed, each one marginally less embarrassing than the last. It's like watching someone learn to walkâ€”inspiring in its own way, but you're mostly just relieved they stopped falling over.

**Birdie Count:** Zero. Gregg treated birdies like mythical creaturesâ€”heard about them, never seen one personally. Four rounds, zero birdies, bronze medal. That's the Gregg Williams special: achieve through absence of catastrophe rather than presence of excellence.

**The Final Margin:** Beat Henry by one point. ONE. Henry had four birdies; Gregg had zero. Henry attacked; Gregg survived. Gregg won. Golf makes no sense.

**Signature Moment:** Those six Round 1 triple bogeys, followed by not doing that again. When your signature achievement is "stopped being terrible," you've had that kind of week.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg's bronze medal was earned through the simple strategy of being slightly less disastrous than Henry. Zero birdies, zero excitement, one bronze medal. Consistency through mediocrity is still consistency.

**Rating:** 5/10 for performance. 3/10 for excitement. 8/10 for improvement trajectory.

## Henry MELLER - "The Attacking Also-Ran"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 137 pts, +27) | 4th (Gross: 96 strokes, +24)

### The Review

Henry Meller played attacking golf at TEG 3 and learned a valuable lesson: sometimes attacking golf just means you lose with more style.

**The Birdie King:** Four birdies across the tournament. FOUR. That's more than everyone else combined. Henry was out here collecting birdies like they were going out of style, which apparently they were because he still finished fourth.

**Round 3 Glory:** Thirty-eight points including three birdies. Best round of the tournament by anyone. For 18 holes, Henry was magnificent. Unfortunately, tournaments last 72 holes, and Henry's other rounds were significantly less magnificent.

**The Math:** One hundred thirty-seven points. One point behind Gregg's bronze-medal-winning 138. Gregg had zero birdies; Henry had four. Gregg won. The universe has a cruel sense of humor.

**The Irony:** Henry attacked. Henry collected birdies. Henry played entertaining golf. Henry finished fourth. Meanwhile, David won the Green Jacket with zero birdies. The lesson is clear: entertainment costs.

**Signature Moment:** That Round 3 with three birdies and 38 points. When your signature achievement is one brilliant round in a losing effort, you're Henry Meller.

**Overall Assessment:** Henry proved that attacking golf doesn't always beat grinding mediocrity. Four birdies, fourth place. One point from bronze. Sometimes the universe rewards boring over brilliant, and Henry learned that lesson the hard way.

**Rating:** 7/10 for entertainment. 6/10 for results. 10/10 for proving birdies are overrated.

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Quantum Paradox"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 135 pts, +29) | 2nd (Gross: 84 strokes, +12)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann achieved something truly special at TEG 3: finishing last in Stableford while simultaneously claiming second in gross scoring. SchrÃ¶dinger's golferâ€”simultaneously successful and disastrous until you check the scorecard.

**The Wooden Spoon:** One hundred thirty-five points. Last place. Wooden spoon secured. Stuartcollected golf's least prestigious trophy with all the enthusiasm of someone who knows he's also got something good to tell people about.

**The gross Silver:** Eighty-four strokes. Second place. Just 12 behind David's winning score. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that suggests competence.

**The Paradox:** Last in Stableford, second in gross. LAST AND SECOND. This is golf's version of quantum mechanicsâ€”existing in two states simultaneously, both of them real, one of them deeply embarrassing. Stuartprobably doesn't know whether to celebrate or hide.

**The Numbers:** 32-32-35-36 in Stableford. That's not variety; that's a gentle upward slope from "not good" to "still not quite good enough." One birdie all tournament. One. Stuarttreated birdies like solar eclipsesâ€”rare, briefly exciting, mostly something other people experienced.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting the wooden spoon with one hand while accepting second-place gross congratulations with the other. The cognitive dissonance must have been spectacular.

**Overall Assessment:** Stuartproved that golf's dual scoring systems can produce outcomes so absurd they defy logic. Last AND second. Wooden spoon AND silver. He exists in a superposition of success and failure, and we're all worse off for trying to understand it.

**Rating:** 2/10 for Stableford. 7/10 for gross. 12/10 for confusing everyone.
