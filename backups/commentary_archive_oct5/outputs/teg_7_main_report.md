# TEG 7 Tournament Report: Henry's One Shining Moment

**Lisbon Coast, Portugal | October 2014**

Welcome to TEG 7 at Praia D'El Rey—Cabell B. Robinson's ocean-view championship design (course record: 10 over par, David Mullin TEG 7 R4)—where Henry Meller discovered what it feels like to dominate a TEG from start to finish. One hundred points through two rounds. A 19-point lead. Wire-to-wire victory by 5 points. His first TEG Trophy. His only TEG Trophy. The one shining moment in Henry Meller's TEG career.

This was Henry's tournament, achieved with 175 points (net vs par) and a performance that built an insurmountable lead before promptly declining but not quite collapsing. David Mullin and Gregg Williams tied for second with 170 points each, five behind Henry's total. David collected his sixth consecutive Green Jacket from joint second place because the streak knows no bounds. And Alex Baker made his TEG debut by immediately collecting the wooden spoon with 152 points. Welcome to TEG, Alex.

## The 100-Point Knockout

Let's start with what Henry Meller did in the first two rounds: scored 100 points. Forty-nine in Round 1. Fifty-one in Round 2. One hundred points in 36 holes. Game over.

After Round 1, Henry led by 3 points over a pack of four players all within a point of each other. Competitive? Certainly. Then came Round 2's 51-point masterpiece that opened a 19-point chasm. Nineteen. Jon Baker sat second, 19 points back, probably wondering what planet Henry was visiting and whether there were spare tickets.

One hundred points through two rounds is what we call "building a cushion." It's also what we call "using up all your golf early and hoping it's enough." Spoiler: it was.

## The Decline (But Still Victory)

Here's what Henry did after building that 19-point lead: declined. Round 3 posted 37 points while Gregg and Jon both posted 42. The lead shrank to 5. Round 4 posted 38 while David, Gregg, and Stuartall pushed hard. The lead stayed at 5.

Henry went from 49-51 dominance to 37-38 survival mode, but the mathematics were unforgiving for everyone else: 19 points is too many to overcome when your challenger is only posting marginally better scores. Henry won by not collapsing harder than he'd already collapsed, which is a strategy, technically.

## The Joint Second Place Drama

David Mullin and Gregg Williams both finished on 170 points, tied for second, five points behind Henry. David collected his sixth consecutive Green Jacket because gross scoring doesn't care about your net position or whether you're sharing second place.

The irony? Gregg won his first Trophy at TEG 6 while declining each round. Henry won his only Trophy at TEG 7 while declining after Round 2. The lesson is clear: start brilliantly, then manage your decline like a controlled explosion.

## Alex Baker's Debut

Alex Baker made his first TEG appearance and immediately collected the wooden spoon with 152 points, 23 behind Henry's winning total. Welcome to TEG, Alex. Here's your participation trophy. It's wooden. You came last.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Henry 49 (leads by 3), David/Gregg 46, Stuart45, Jon 43, Alex 39 (debut!)

**Round 2:** Henry 51 (extends to +19!), David 46, Stuart45, Gregg/Jon 40, Alex 38

**Round 3:** Henry 37 (lead down to +5), Gregg/Jon 42, David 41, Stuart40, Alex 41

**Round 4:** Henry 38 (wins by 5!), David 43, Gregg/Stuart42, Jon 39, Alex 34

## The Verdict

Henry Meller's first and only TEG Trophy was earned through spectacular early dominance followed by managed decline. One hundred points in two rounds built an insurmountable lead. Thirty-seven and 38 in the final two rounds held off the challengers by just enough.

David and Gregg's joint second (170 each) told different stories—David collecting his sixth consecutive Green Jacket, Gregg finishing runner-up a year after winning. Stu's fourth place (169, one point behind the joint second) was agonizingly close yet thoroughly insufficient. Jon's fifth (164) was forgettable. And Alex's wooden spoon debut (152) was memorable for all the wrong reasons.

Praia D'El Rey witnessed Henry Meller's coronation, with David Mullin setting the course record of 10 over par in Round 4 even as he finished joint second in Stableford. The net vs par format continued for one more year. And Henry proved that sometimes, just sometimes, hitting birdies actually matters when you hit enough of them early enough to build a lead nobody can overcome. His only Trophy. His finest moment. The one time Henry Meller was TEG champion.
