# TEG 7 - Player Profiles

---

## Henry MELLER - 1st (Net vs Par: 175 pts) | 4th (Gross)

Henry Meller won his first and only TEG Trophy at Praia D'El Rey by discovering what happens when you score 100 points in two rounds: you win. Comprehensively.

**The Opening Blitz:** Forty-nine points in Round 1. Fifty-one in Round 2. ONE HUNDRED POINTS IN 36 HOLES. That's not golf; that's a demolition. A 19-point lead after Round 2. Game. Over.

**The Decline:** Then came Rounds 3 and 4: 37 and 38 points. Henry went from dominant to merely adequate, but when you've built a 19-point cushion, "adequate" is more than enough. The lead shrank to 5, but 5 was sufficient.

## David MULLIN - 2nd= (Net vs Par: 170 pts, +5) | 1st (Gross, **Green Jacket**)

David Mullin tied for second with 170 points, five behind Henry's winning total, and collected his sixth consecutive Green Jacket because the streak doesn't care about your net position.

**The Chase:** Started 3 points behind Henry after R1. Fell to 19 points behind after R2's 51-point Henry explosion. Closed to 5 by the finish. Valiant effort. Completely insufficient.

**The Tie:** One hundred seventy points, tied with Gregg for second. Shared silver. The indignity.

---

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 2nd= (Net vs Par: 170 pts, +5) | 3rd (Gross)

Gregg Williams tied for second with 170 points, matching David but finishing without a Green Jacket to show for it.

**The Year After:** Last year Gregg won his first Trophy while declining each round. This year he finished tied second while... also declining after R2. Patterns!

**The Rounds:** 46-40-42-42. Started well, dipped in R2, recovered for R3-R4. Decent golf that fell 5 points short of Henry's total and tied with David for second.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 4th (Net vs Par: 169 pts, +6) | 2nd (Gross)

Stuart Neumann finished fourth with 169 points, one agonizing point behind the joint second-place total, and somehow claimed second in gross scoring.

**The Agony:** One hundred sixty-nine points. David and Gregg: 170. ONE POINT. Stuartfinished one point from sharing second and probably spent the flight home calculating where that point disappeared.

**The Rounds:** 45-45-40-42. Solid. Professional. Exactly one point insufficient for joint second. The mathematics of cruelty.

---

## Jon BAKER - 5th (Net vs Par: 164 pts, +11) | 5th (Gross)

Jon Baker finished fifth with 164 points in a tournament where finishing fifth meant you were thoroughly forgotten.

**The Rounds:** 43-40-42-39. That's not inspiring; that's treading water while watching Henry build an insurmountable lead and everyone else fight for scraps.

**The Gap:** Eleven points behind Henry. Six points behind the joint second. One point behind Stu's fourth. Fifth place, thoroughly earned, thoroughly forgettable.

---

## Alex BAKER - 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Net vs Par: 152 pts, +23) | 6th (Gross)

Alex Baker made his TEG debut at Praia D'El Rey and immediately collected the wooden spoon with 152 points, 23 behind Henry's winning total.

**The Welcome:** Welcome to TEG, Alex! Here's a wooden spoon. You came last. Enjoy your stay.

**The Rounds:** 39-38-41-34. That's not a learning curve; that's consistent incompetence with a particularly bad final round thrown in for variety.
