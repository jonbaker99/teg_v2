# TEG 6 - Player Profiles

---

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 1st (Net vs Par: 145 pts) | 3rd (Gross)

Gregg Williams won his first TEG Trophy by discovering a revolutionary strategy: start brilliantly, then decline steadily while hoping nobody notices.

**The Opening Statement:** Forty-eight points in Round 1. FORTY-EIGHT. That's not golf; that's a mic drop. A 4-point lead established. Trophy trajectory: set. Champagne: on ice.

**The Decline:** Then came Rounds 2, 3, and 4: 36, 33, 28. Each round worse than the last. Gregg didn't so much win as gradually stop winning less badly than Jon. By Round 4, Gregg was posting 28 pointsâ€”his worst roundâ€”and somehow that was enough because he'd built such a cushion with that absurd opener.

## Jon BAKER - 2nd (Net vs Par: 142 pts, +3) | 2nd (Gross)

Jon Baker spent TEG 6 doing what Jon does best: threatening to win while ultimately finishing second.

**The Chase:** Started 4 points behind after Gregg's ridiculous R1. Closed to 3 points behind by the finish. Progress! Insufficient progress, but progress.

**The Rounds:** 44-40-32-26. That's not a comeback; that's a gradual acceptance of defeat. Jon peaked in R2 (40 points) and then declined faster than Gregg declined, which is the only reason Gregg won.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 3rd (Net vs Par: 139 pts, +6) | 4th (Gross)

Stuart Neumann claimed bronze with 139 points through the time-honored Stuartstrategy: be present, be competent, be forgettable.

**The Rounds:** 37-36-35-31. That's descending mediocrity with remarkable consistency. Stuartstarted mediocre and got slightly worse, which was good enough for third because everyone else also got worse.

**The Gap:** Six points behind Gregg. Never threatened. Never close. Just... there. Occupying third place like someone occupying a seat on the bus.

## David MULLIN - 4th (Net vs Par: 135 pts, +10) | 1st (Gross, **Green Jacket**)

David Mullin finished fourth in the net competition and collected his fifth consecutive Green Jacket because gross scoring doesn't care about your net position.

**The Net Reality:** One hundred thirty-five points. Fourth place. Ten behind Gregg. Thoroughly beaten in the actual competition.

**The gross Truth:** Won the Green Jacket. Fifth consecutive. Dominant gross scoring from a fourth-place net finish. This is David's entire brand: win the competition that matters to David while losing the one everyone else is playing.

## Henry MELLER - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Net vs Par: 123 pts, +22) | 5th (Gross)

Henry Meller collected the wooden spoon with 123 points, finishing 22 behind Gregg's winning total and comprehensively last.

**The Numbers:** 28-31-34-30. That's not progress; that's random variation around "bad." Henry peaked in Round 3 (34 points) when it absolutely didn't matter, then declined to 30 in R4 because why not.

**The Margin:** Twenty-two points behind Gregg. Not close. Not threatening. Just distant last, the way Henry does it.
