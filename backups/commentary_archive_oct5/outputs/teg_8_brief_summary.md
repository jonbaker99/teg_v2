# TEG 8 - Brief Summary

Gregg Williams claimed his second TEG Trophy at Quinta da Marinha with 149 Stableford points, marking the historic switch to pure Stableford scoring. Leading wire-to-wire with rounds of 38-41-29-41, Gregg's victory featured a dramatic Round 3 wobble that shrank his 9-point lead to just 1, before a dominant 41-point finale sealed a 12-point triumph. This was Stableford's proper debut, and Gregg approved comprehensively.

Alex Baker's second-place finish (137 points) completed a remarkable redemption arc—from last year's wooden spoon debut to silver medal in twelve months. Jon Baker's bronze (131) and David Mullin's fourth place (126) rounded out the top positions, with David collecting his seventh consecutive Green Jacket from fourth in Stableford—the David Mullin paradox now routine.

Henry Meller's fifth place (111 points) and Stuart Neumann's wooden spoon (100 points) marked the bottom of the six-player field. Quinta da Marinha witnessed Stableford's arrival, Gregg's second title, Alex's redemption, and David's seventh Green Jacket. The format had changed; the results remained delightfully absurd.
