# TEG 11 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 11*

## Jon BAKER - "The Double Champion"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 143 pts) | 1st (Gross: 70 strokes, **FIRST Green Jacket**)
**Dominance:** Led 59/72 holes (Stableford), 70/72 holes (Gross)

### The Review

Jon Baker arrived at PGA Catalunya and proceeded to demonstrate what "dominance" actually looks like. Led after every single round in both competitions. Won all four gross rounds. Led 70 of 72 possible holes in gross. This wasn't golf—this was a masterclass in making everyone else irrelevant.

**The Rounds:** 35-32-37-39 Stableford points. Opened strong, stayed strong, finished strong. Jon never faded, never panicked, never gave anyone hope. The closest competitor after Round 3 was seven points back. By Round 4, it was academic.

**The gross Annihilation:** Won every single round. Led 70 of 72 holes. Finished 3 strokes clear of David, ending his nine-tournament Green Jacket streak. Jon didn't just win the jacket—he buried David's dynasty.

**The Efficiency:** Two birdies across four rounds. Jon treated birdies like garnishes—nice to have, completely unnecessary for victory. He won with grinding, relentless competence while everyone else made mistakes.

**Wire-to-Wire That Actually Was:** Unlike some players who claim dominance while leading for 33 holes, Jon led 59 of 72 in Stableford and 70 of 72 in gross. That's how you wire-to-wire.

**Signature Moment:** Winning all four gross rounds to claim his first Green Jacket while simultaneously ending David's nine-tournament streak. When your signature moment is demolishing a dynasty, you've had a good week.

**Overall Assessment:** Jon's double was earned through four days of ruthless, methodical golf that gave nobody a chance. He led from start to finish, won by 6 in Stableford and 3 in gross, and made it look easy. Sometimes dominance doesn't need drama.

**Rating:** 10/10 for dominance. 10/10 for ending David's streak. 10/10 for never being threatened.

## Alex BAKER - "The Zero-Birdie Runner-Up"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 137 pts, +6) | 4th (Gross: 106 strokes, +36)

### The Review

Alex Baker finished second with 137 Stableford points and zero birdies in 72 holes. ZERO. Not one. Alex spent four days playing competent golf without once threatening to be excellent, which is both impressive and deeply sad.

**The Opening Lead:** Round 1's 32 points led the tournament. For approximately 18 holes, Alex looked like he might repeat his TEG 10 heroics. Then Jon posted 35 in Round 1, and Alex's lead evaporated into "briefly competitive."

**The Fade:** After leading R1, Alex posted 32-33-40 across the final three rounds. Solid. Respectable. Thoroughly insufficient to challenge Jon's relentless march to victory. By Round 3, Alex was seven points back. By Round 4, the gap was six. Runner-up secured, victory never threatened.

**The Birdie Drought:** Zero birdies in 72 holes. Alex joined the elite "runner-up without a birdie" club, which sounds exclusive until you realize it just means you played 72 holes of professional mediocrity.

**The Consistency:** Never finished worse than 4th in any round. Also never won a round. Alex was consistently good enough to avoid disaster, never good enough to win.

**Signature Moment:** Leading after Round 1 with 32 points, then watching Jon immediately take the lead and never look back. When your signature achievement lasts exactly one round, you're not threatening championships.

**Overall Assessment:** Alex played four rounds of solid, birdie-free golf to secure second place. One hundred thirty-seven points would've threatened in some tournaments. At TEG 11, it earned a comfortable runner-up finish and the knowledge that competent isn't enough when someone's being dominant.

**Rating:** 7/10 for consistency. 3/10 for challenging Jon. 0/10 for birdies (literally).

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Bronze Collector"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 136 pts, +7) | 3rd (Gross: 99 strokes, +29)

### The Review

Gregg Williams posted 136 Stableford points to claim bronze, one point behind Alex, seven behind Jon. Gregg spent TEG 11 being very good while Jon was being historic and Alex was being slightly better.

**The Rounds:** 28-31-38-39. Gregg started slowly (5th after R1), improved gradually (4th after R2, 3rd after R3), then posted a strong 39-point finale to secure bronze. The scoring progression of someone who woke up halfway through and remembered how to play golf.

**The Challenge That Wasn't:** Gregg never led a single hole in either competition. Never threatened Jon. Spent four days being professionally competent while the trophy was decided elsewhere.

**The Birdie Situation:** Two birdies across four rounds. Gregg found birdies slightly more frequently than Alex (who had zero) but significantly less frequently than necessary to challenge Jon.

**Third in Both:** Bronze medal in Stableford, bronze in gross. Gregg achieved perfect consistency across both competitions, which is impressive when you remember "consistently third" is still losing twice.

**Signature Moment:** That 38-39 finish across the final two rounds that secured bronze. When your signature achievement is "didn't finish fourth," you've had a solid but unremarkable week.

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg played competent golf, avoided disasters, finished third in everything. Sometimes being good enough for bronze is all you can manage when someone else is being wire-to-wire dominant.

**Rating:** 7/10 for consistency. 5/10 for challenging. 6/10 for accepting bronze gracefully (presumably).

## John PATTERSON - "The Zero-Birdie Specialist"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 135 pts, +8) | 5th (Gross: 123 strokes, +53)

### The Review

John Patterson posted 135 Stableford points and zero birdies, marking his second consecutive tournament without a birdie. That's 144 holes total without once playing better than par. At some point, this stops being a drought and becomes a lifestyle choice.

**The Rounds:** 30-30-34-41. Patterson opened with identical 30-point rounds like someone on autopilot, woke up in Round 3 with 34 points, then posted a career-best 41 in the finale when the tournament was already over.

**The Too-Little-Too-Late Rally:** That 41-point finale was brilliant. Also irrelevant. Patterson discovered how to score points in Round 4, three rounds after it would've mattered. Timing is everything, and Patterson's timing was terrible.

**The Birdie Absence:** TEG 10: zero birdies. TEG 11: zero birdies. Combined: 144 holes without a birdie. Patterson has perfected the art of playing competent golf without ever threatening excellence.

**The Recovery:** After collecting the wooden spoon at TEG 10, Patterson bounced back to fourth place. This sounds like improvement until you realize fourth in a five-player field is still closer to last than first.

**Signature Moment:** That 41-point finale that came three rounds too late. When your signature moment is "played well when it didn't matter," you've summarized your tournament perfectly.

**Overall Assessment:** Patterson spent 144 consecutive holes forgetting birdies exist, then posted a brilliant Round 4 when the tournament was decided. Fourth place, zero birdies, excellent timing (for things that don't matter).

**Rating:** 5/10 for R4. 3/10 for timing. 0/10 for birdies (literally, again).

## David MULLIN - "The Fallen Dynasty"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 125 pts, +18) | 2nd (Gross: 73 strokes, +3)

### The Review

After nine consecutive Green Jackets, David Mullin collected his first wooden spoon. Last place in Stableford. Second in gross (3 behind Jon). The dynasty ended not with a bang but with 125 Stableford points and the knowledge that dominance is temporary.

**The Collapse:** One hundred twenty-five points. David's worst Stableford performance in 11 tournaments. Finished 18 points behind the winner, 10 behind fourth place. This wasn't close—this was comprehensive failure.

**The gross Consolation:** Second place, 3 strokes behind Jon. David won zero gross rounds (Jon won all four). Led for 10 holes midway through. Never threatened after Round 2. The nine-jacket streak ended with a whimper.

**The Rounds:** 27-28-30-40. Catastrophic opening (last place after R1), slow recovery (still last after R2 and R3), brilliant finale (40 points in R4) that arrived three rounds too late. David discovered his form in Round 4, which is when wooden spoons are confirmed, not avoided.

**The Streak Ends:** Nine consecutive Green Jackets (2009-2017). Then Jon showed up with wire-to-wire dominance and ended the dynasty. David finished second in gross by 3 strokes, which sounds respectable until you remember he'd won the previous nine.

**The Irony:** David's 40-point finale was the second-best Round 4 performance (tied with Patterson). Also completely irrelevant—the wooden spoon was already secured, the Green Jacket already lost.

**Signature Moment:** Collecting his first wooden spoon after nine Green Jackets. When your signature moment is ending a decade of dominance with last place, the universe is teaching you humility.

**Overall Assessment:** David's dynasty ended at PGA Catalunya with a wooden spoon and second place in gross. Nine Green Jackets, then one wooden spoon. The TEG giveth, the TEG taketh away. Jon Baker doth the taking.

**Rating:** 2/10 for Stableford. 6/10 for gross (moral victory?). 10/10 for dramatic fall from grace.
