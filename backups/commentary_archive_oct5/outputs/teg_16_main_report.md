# TEG 16 Tournament Report: Stuart's One and Only

**Lisbon Coast, Portugal | October 2023**
**Oitavos Dunes, Troia, Penha Longa, Estoril**

Stuart Neumann claimed his only TEG Trophy with 156 Stableford points, winning by 3 over Gregg Williams (153) in one of the tightest finishes in TEG history. After 12 tournaments and one eagle (TEG 12, the second ever), Stuart finally converted close finishes into championship. He would never win again.

Meanwhile, Gregg Williams won his second consecutive Green Jacket from second place in Stableford, perfecting the David Mullin paradox: finish runner-up in points, dominate in strokes, collect hardware.

And Alex Baker earned his second consecutive wooden spoon with 127 points, confirming that wooden spoons, like family traditions, run in consecutive generations.

## Stuart's Only Trophy

One hundred fifty-six Stableford points won by 3 over Greggâ€”Stuart's tightest margin and only championship. Led after every round (42-81-121-156), won Rounds 1 and 2, held off Gregg's challenge in Rounds 3-4. The wire-to-wire victory was comprehensive despite the narrow margin.

Twelve tournaments played. One trophy won. Stuart arrived at TEG 16, claimed victory, then spent TEG 17 proving it was an anomaly. Sometimes you get one moment of excellence in a career of mediocrity. Stuart got his at TEG 16.

## Gregg's Second Jacket from Second Place

Gregg Williams finished runner-up in Stableford for the sixth time (153 points, 3 behind Stuart), then won his second consecutive Green Jacket with 37 strokes over par. The paradox perfected: lose Stableford, dominate gross, collect jacket.

Gregg had won his first double at TEG 15. At TEG 16, he settled for half: runner-up in Stableford, champion in gross. The David Mullin paradox had found a new practitioner.

## Alex's Second Wooden Spoon

Alex Baker finished last with 127 pointsâ€”his second consecutive wooden spoon. TEG 15: wooden spoon. TEG 16: wooden spoon. Alex had discovered his level: last place, repeatedly.

One hundred twenty-seven points finished 14 behind fourth place. Alex wasn't close to avoiding lastâ€”he was comprehensively worse than everyone. Back-to-back wooden spoons confirmed the TEG 15 disaster wasn't an anomaly.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Stuart 42 leads, Gregg 41, Jon 40, David 34, Alex 32

**Round 2:** Stuart 81 (extends to +2), Gregg 79, Jon 74, David 69, Alex 65

**Round 3:** Stuart 121 (dominates by +5), Gregg 116, Jon 110, David 104, Alex 95 (WS emerging)

**Round 4:** Stuart 156 (seals it by 3), Gregg 153, Jon 148, David 141, Alex 127 (WS confirmed)

## The Verdict

TEG 16 delivered Stuart Neumann's only trophy (156 points, won by 3), Gregg Williams' second jacket from second place (153 Stableford, 37 gross), and Alex Baker's second consecutive wooden spoon (127 points). Stuart would never win again. Gregg would never perfect the paradox better. Alex would finish TEG 17 in fourth place, proving wooden spoons aren't permanent.
