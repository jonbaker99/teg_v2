# TEG 3 Tournament Report: Wire-to-Wire Dominance

**Boavista Golf Course, Lagos, Algarve, Portugal | October 2010**

Jon Baker arrived at Boavista—Howard Swan's championship design (course record: 4 over par, David Mullin TEG 10 R1)—seeking redemption after his Round 3 collapse the previous year. What he delivered was something altogether more emphatic: a wire-to-wire demolition that saw him claim his second TEG Trophy with 164 Stableford points, leading from the first hole to the last over four rounds of remorseless consistency.

The mathematics were brutal: a 17-point winning margin over David Mullin. The narrative was even more compelling: while David claimed his second consecutive Green Jacket with dominant gross scoring (and zero birdies), it was Jon who mastered Stableford with a performance that proved last year's implosion had taught him everything he needed to know about not collapsing.

## The Seventy-Two Hole Occupation

Jon didn't win TEG 3 so much as annex it, plant a flag, and issue building permits. Led after every single round. Never trailed. Never even looked threatened. This wasn't golf; this was a four-day seminar on how to be boringly dominant.

The rounds tell the story: 45, 41, 35, 43. That's not excitement; that's consistency with a spreadsheet. While David ground out the Green Jacket with his trademark zero-birdie excellence, Jon simply accumulated points like a miser counts pennies. Seventy-two holes of occupation. The tournament equivalent of squatting.

## David's Birdies-Are-Overrated Masterclass

Here's what David Mullin did at TEG 3: won the Green Jacket by 12 strokes. Here's what David didn't do: hit a single birdie in 72 holes. Not one. Zero. Nada.

This is David's entire brand distilled to its purest form: birdies are for show, pars are for dough. While Henry was out there hitting four birdies like some sort of show-off, David was grinding out his second consecutive Green Jacket with all the flair of a tax audit. One hundred forty-seven Stableford points left him 17 behind Jon, but 72 gross strokes gave him the Green Jacket by 12. Different games, same David, same grinding excellence.

## Stu's Quantum Paradox

Stuart Neumann achieved something truly special at TEG 3: finishing last in Stableford (135 points, wooden spoon secured) while simultaneously claiming second in gross scoring (84 strokes). Last AND second. Simultaneously.

This is golf's version of quantum mechanics—existing in two states at once, both of them confusing, one of them deeply embarrassing. Stuartcollected the wooden spoon with one hand and a second-place gross trophy with the other, probably wondering which one to mention first at dinner parties.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Jon 45 (leads by 8), David 37 (2nd, no birdies), Henry 33, Stuart32, Gregg 31 (6 triple bogeys start his week poorly)

**Round 2:** Jon 41 (extends to +15), David 36 (grinding), Gregg 35 (improves), Henry/Stuart32 each

**Round 3:** Jon 35 (maintains +13), David 37 (still no birdies), Henry 38 with 3 birdies (best round!), Gregg 36, Stuart35

**Round 4:** Jon 43 (seals 17-point win), David 37 (seals GJ with 0 birdies for tournament), Gregg/Stuart36 each, Henry 35

## The Verdict

Jon Baker's second TEG Trophy was earned through sheer, relentless, spreadsheet-like consistency. Led for 72 holes. Never looked back. Never looked threatened. Redemption achieved through being magnificently boring.

David proved you don't need birdies when you simply don't make mistakes. Zero birdies, one Green Jacket, second place in Stableford. The accountant's dream round, extended across four days.

Gregg's bronze (138) edged Henry's fourth (137) by a single point—Henry's four birdies proving that attacking golf doesn't always beat grinding mediocrity. And Stuartcollected his wooden spoon while finishing second in gross, proving once again that golf's dual scoring systems have a cruel sense of humor.

Four rounds, one Boavista course, two champions playing completely different games. Jon occupied; David ground; everyone else just tried to keep up.
