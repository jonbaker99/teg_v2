# TEG 9 Tournament Report: Patterson's Debut Masterclass

**Lisbon Coast, Portugal | September-October 2016**
**Royal Óbidos, Praia D'El Rey, Belas Clube de Campo**

John Patterson arrived at Royal Óbidos—Seve Ballesteros's clifftop masterpiece overlooking the Atlantic—for his first TEG and proceeded to demonstrate that sometimes the best way to win is to simply lead from start to finish without drama, complexity, or memorable moments. One hundred sixty-eight Stableford points. Wire-to-wire victory. Six-point margin. Debut trophy secured. Welcome to TEG, Patterson. Here's your championship.

Alex Baker finished second for the second consecutive year with 162 points, establishing himself as TEG's professional runner-up. David Mullin finished third in Stableford and collected his eighth consecutive Green Jacket because the streak had achieved self-awareness and continued regardless of David's Stableford position. Stuart Neumann collected his second consecutive wooden spoon, improving from last year's historically bad 100 points to this year's merely terrible 127.

## The Debut Domination

Patterson's first TEG featured rounds of 39-44-43-42 that told the story of early control, mid-tournament dominance, and late-tournament cruise control. Led after Round 1 by 2 points. Extended the lead to 6 after a joint-best 44-point Round 2. Maintained control through Rounds 3 and 4. Won by 6. Trophy collected. Debut complete.

This wasn't dramatic golf; this was efficient golf. Patterson didn't win with flair or memorable moments. He won by being slightly better than everyone else for 72 consecutive holes. Sometimes that's enough. Sometimes that's more than enough.

## Alex: Professional Runner-Up

Alex Baker finished second for the second year running with 162 points, six behind Patterson. Last year he chased Gregg's wobbling victory. This year he chased Patterson's boring dominance. Both times: second place. Alex had discovered his TEG calling: professional runner-up.

His rounds (37-44-41-40) showed consistency without the crucial extra gear needed to actually win. That joint-best 44 in Round 2 matched Patterson's score but didn't take the lead. The rest was chasing, closing gaps that never quite closed enough. Silver medal specialist.

## David's Eighth From Third

David Mullin finished third in Stableford with 148 points, 20 behind Patterson's winning total. Eighth consecutive Green Jacket from third place. The paradox had become so routine that nobody questioned it anymore. Third in Stableford, first in Green Jackets. Eight years running. The streak had achieved immortality.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Patterson 39 (debut lead!), Alex 37, Jon/David 36, Gregg 34, Stuart31

**Round 2:** Patterson/Alex both 44 (Patterson leads by 6), David 38, Jon 36, Gregg 35, Stuart33

**Round 3:** Patterson 43, Alex 41 (gap stays 6), David 39, Gregg/Jon 37, Stuart33

**Round 4:** Patterson 42 (wins by 6!), Alex 40, Jon/Gregg 37, David 35, Stuart30

## The Verdict

John Patterson's debut TEG Trophy was earned through wire-to-wire dominance that lacked drama but achieved victory. Led for 72 holes. Won by 6. Trophy secured. Sometimes boring wins.

Alex's second consecutive runner-up finish established a pattern. Jon's fourth (146) and Gregg's fifth (143) were forgettable. David's eighth consecutive Green Jacket from third in Stableford was vintage David. And Stu's second consecutive wooden spoon (127 points) proved that improvement from 100 to 127 still means last place.

Royal Óbidos witnessed Patterson's coronation. The eighth Green Jacket joined David's collection. And Alex learned that being consistently good still means finishing second when someone else is consistently better.
