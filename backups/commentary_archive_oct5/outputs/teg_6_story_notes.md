R4: Gregg 28 (wins by 3), Jon 26, Stuart31, David 31, Henry 30

## Story Angles
- Gregg's backwards trajectory: started 48, finished 28, still won
- R1's 48 points = early knockout punch
- Jon's late fade (26 in R4)
- David: 4th in net, 1st in GJ (5th consecutive!)
- Gregg's nervousness showing? Each round worse than last
- Still net vs par (Stableford switch comes TEG 8)

## Quote-Worthy Lines
- "Winning while declining"
- "48-point opener, 28-point closer, one trophy"
- "Gregg peaked in Round 1 and coasted downhill to victory"
- "David finished 4th and collected his 5th Green Jacket - different games"

## Stats
- Gregg: Led 72/72 holes despite declining scores
- Jon: 142 pts, only 3 behind
- David: 5th consecutive GJ, 4th in net
- Margin: Gregg won by just 3 pts despite R1's dominance
