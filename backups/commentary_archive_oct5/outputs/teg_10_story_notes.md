# TEG 10 Story Notes

## Location & Venue
- **RETURN TO BOAVISTA - The Spiritual Home of TEG**
- **Algarve, Portugal** - First return to Algarve since TEG 5 (2012), 5 years away
- **Bookended by Boavista:** R1 and R4 at the course where TEG began
- Also played Palmares courses (Praia/Alvor and Alvor/Lagos routes)
- Homecoming tournament after years exploring Spain (TEG 6, 11) and Lisbon Coast (TEG 7-9)

### The Homecoming Courses
**Boavista** (R1, R4) - Howard Swan championship design. **Course Record:** 4 over par (David, R1 of THIS tournament!)
**Palmares - Praia/Alvor** (R2): Record 10 over par (Jon Baker, TEG 10 R2)
**Palmares - Alvor/Lagos** (R3): Record 15 over par (Gregg Williams, TEG 10 R3)

## Key Points
- **Alex Baker's ONLY career TEG Trophy** - 184 points (best score of all time to date)
- **David's 9th consecutive Green Jacket** - Third place Stableford, first gross (from 3rd!)
- **John Patterson's wooden spoon** - One year after winning on debut (112 pts, zero birdies in 72 holes)
- **11-point victory margin** for Alex (beat runner-up Gregg by 11)
- **David led Stableford for 37 holes and STILL finished third** (largest lead thrown)

## How It Unfolded
**Round 1:** Gregg leads with 48 points, David 44, Alex 42
**Round 2:** David takes Stableford lead (90 total), Alex 2nd (84), Gregg 3rd (83)
**Round 3:** Alex takes lead back (133), David still in it (132), Gregg (130)
**Round 4:** Alex destroys the field with 51 points to win by 11

## Story Angles
- Alex's best-ever performance (184 pts = all-time record to date) for his ONLY trophy
- David's paradox continues: led for 37 holes in Stableford, finished 3rd, still won Green Jacket (#9 consecutive)
- Patterson's brutal sophomore slump: won TEG 9 on debut, collected wooden spoon at TEG 10 with zero birdies
- Gregg led after R1, finished 2nd (11 points behind)
- Alex's Round 4 masterpiece: 51 points to seal it

## Quote-Worthy Lines

- "David led for 37 holes and finished third - this is the David Mullin experience"
