*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 2*

## David MULLIN - "The Inaugural Champion"

**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 103 pts) | 1st (Gross: 66 strokes)

### The Review

David Mullin arrived at TEG 2 and proceeded to demonstrate that winning your first TEG Trophy doesn't require fireworks, flair, or even particularly good golf. It just requires everyone else to be slightly worse.

**The Opening Statement:** Round 1's 36 points featured 22 on the front nine and two actual birdies. For David, this was equivalent to a royal flush. He'd used up his year's allocation of exciting golf in nine holes and decided to coast the rest of the way on fumes and determination.

**The 18th Hole Incident:** Round 2, hole 18. Triple bogey or worse. Zero Stableford points. David participated in what can only be described as synchronized golfing incompetence with Gregg and Jon—three grown men simultaneously discovering that the 18th hole has teeth. The probability of this occurring is roughly equivalent to being struck by lightning while winning the lottery. Except instead of money, you win humiliation.

**The Championship Response:** Round 3 was David's masterpiece: 38 points of metronomic precision. Nineteen front, nineteen back. Zero triple bogeys. Zero drama. While Jon imploded with six catastrophic holes, David simply played golf like a man filling out a tax form—methodical, accurate, completely devoid of entertainment value.

**Career Stats:** Two birdies, 103 points, both trophies. This is David's entire brand: be boring, be consistent, be champion. It's not sexy, but it works.

**Signature Moment:** Surviving the 18th hole disaster in R2 and responding with a perfect R3. Champions recover; David recovered like a man who'd simply misplaced his car keys.

**Overall Assessment:** David won his first TEG Trophy by being slightly less disastrous than everyone else. His golf is the sporting equivalent of elevator music—you don't really notice it, but somehow it gets you where you need to go. First of many titles. Still waiting for the entertainment.

**Rating:** 10/10 for winning. 3/10 for excitement. 10/10 for establishing the "grinding northern git" reputation.

## Jon BAKER - "The Soufflé"

**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 98 pts, +5) | 4th (Gross: 97 strokes, +31)

### The Review

Jon Baker's TEG 2 can be neatly summarized as a cooking disaster: spectacular rise in Round 2, catastrophic collapse in Round 3. The golfing equivalent of a soufflé that looked Instagram-worthy for approximately 45 minutes before imploding into sadness.

**Round 1:** A solid 33 points. Professional. Threatening. Sitting 3 points behind David like a patient assassin.

**Round 2 - The Glory:** Thirty-seven Stableford points of absolute brilliance. The front nine posted 24 points—TWENTY-FOUR—and briefly suggested Jon might actually trouble David's coronation. One birdie, one magnificent front nine, one moment of pure golfing joy. Jon led by 5 heading into the finale. The trophy was visible. The champagne was on ice.

**The 18th Hole Participation:** Oh yes, Jon also participated in the R2, hole 18 disaster. Triple bogey or worse. Zero points. He was one-third of the statistical anomaly that will haunt Boavista's 18th hole forever. Pride comes before a fall; Jon's pride came before a triple bogey.

**Round 3 - The Collapse:** Twenty-eight points of existential crisis. Six triple bogeys. A 9-hole streak of double bogeys or worse spanning rounds 2 and 3. This wasn't golf; this was an intervention. Jon went from front-runner to also-ran faster than you can say "what happened?"

**Final Margin:** Lost by 5. The exact margin he led by after R2. Poetic. Painful. Perfectly Jon.

**Signature Moment:** That glorious R2 front nine (24 points) which will be remembered primarily as "the last time Jon looked like winning before he remembered he was Jon."

**Overall Assessment:** Baker provided the tournament's only legitimate drama by surging into the lead and then promptly forgetting how to golf. Second place tastes like ashes when you briefly held the trophy. Should have won; didn't. That's going to sting for a while.

**Rating:** 9/10 for R2. 2/10 for R3. 7/10 for teaching us about the fragility of leads.

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Reliable One"

**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 89 pts, +14) | 2nd (Gross: 77 strokes, +11)

### The Review

Stuart Neumann played TEG 2 like a man who'd read the assignment, understood the assignment, and decided "bronze medal will do nicely, thanks."

**The Rounds:** 27, 29, 33. That's not a scoring progression; that's a gentle upward slope. Stuartimproved each round with all the drama of watching grass grow. Consistent? Yes. Exciting? Have you ever watched paint dry? Because that's roughly the same experience.

**Round 3 Birdie:** Stuartmanaged one birdie in Round 3, suggesting he was warming to the task. Unfortunately, by then the tournament was over and everyone had gone home. It's like arriving to a party with great wine after everyone's switched to coffee and regrets.

**The gross Competition:** Second place with 77 strokes, just 11 behind David. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that makes people nod appreciatively while secretly wondering if they could name a single memorable shot you hit.

**Championship Implications:** None. Stuartwas never winning this. Never in the conversation. Never threatening. He was golf's equivalent of a supporting actor—necessary for the plot, utterly forgettable in the grand scheme.

**Signature Moment:** That R3 birdie. When your signature moment is a single birdie in the final round of a tournament you're not contending, you know it's been That Kind of Week.

**Overall Assessment:** Stuartdelivered exactly what you'd expect from Stu: solid, professional, entirely unmemorable golf that earned him bronze and second in gross. He's the reliable friend who always shows up but never brings stories. Bless him.

**Rating:** 6/10 for consistency. 2/10 for entertainment. 8/10 for being exactly who we thought he was.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Struggler"

**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 86 pts, +17) | 5th (Gross: 111 strokes, +45)

### The Review

Gregg Williams spent TEG 2 proving that golf is hard, Boavista is harder, and some weeks you're just the universe's cosmic punchline.

**The Opening Disaster:** Round 1 posted 28 points and six triple bogeys, including participation in Gregg's least favorite game: "how many consecutive holes can I disaster?" The answer was frequently "more than you'd think."

**The 8-Hole Horror:** Somewhere between rounds 1 and 2, Gregg discovered an 8-hole streak of double bogeys or worse. Eight holes. Eight disasters. It's not a streak; it's a lifestyle choice. It's golf's version of a true crime documentary, except the only victim is Gregg's scorecard.

**The 18th Hole Club:** Yes, Gregg was the third member of the R2, hole 18 triple bogey society. Three players, one hole, one collective meltdown. Gregg fit right in because at that point, what's one more disaster among friends?

**The 40-Hole Marathon:** Gregg also managed a 40-hole streak over par. Forty holes. That's not bad luck; that's a commitment to bogeys that borders on religious devotion.

**Birdie Count:** One. Gregg treated birdies like Bigfoot sightings—rumored to exist, occasionally spotted, never properly documented.

**Signature Moment:** That 8-hole streak of suffering. When your signature moment is eight consecutive disasters, the universe is trying to tell you something. Possibly "take up tennis."

**Overall Assessment:** Gregg finished fourth with 86 points and a tournament's worth of therapy bills. Last in gross, fourth in Stableford, first in collecting disasters like Pokémon cards. Some weeks golf hugs you; some weeks it punches you in the face. Gregg got punched.

**Rating:** 3/10 for performance. 2/10 for luck. 10/10 for persistence in the face of overwhelming evidence he should stop.

## Henry MELLER - "The Paradox"

**Final Position:** 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 75 pts, +28) | 3rd (Gross: 93 strokes, +27)

### The Review

Henry Meller achieved something truly special at TEG 2: finishing last in Stableford while simultaneously claiming third in gross scoring. This is golf's version of quantum mechanics—existing in two states simultaneously, both of them confusing, one of them deeply embarrassing.

**Round 1 - The Horror:** Eighteen Stableford points. Sounds bad? It gets worse. Holes 11-15 featured FIVE CONSECUTIVE TRIPLE BOGEYS. Five holes. Five disasters. One after another, like dominos falling, except the dominos are your hopes and dreams and they're all on fire.

**The Mathematics of Suffering:** Five consecutive triples in Round 1 doesn't just cost you points; it costs you dignity, pride, and any illusions about your golfing ability. Henry watched those five holes unfold like a slow-motion car crash, except he was driving all five cars simultaneously.

**The Recovery:** Rounds 2 and 3 showed improvement (23 and 34 points), including a birdie in R3. Noble attempt. Completely insufficient to undo R1's carnage. It's like trying to mop up the Titanic with a kitchen sponge.

**The Wooden Spoon:** Seventy-five points. Last place. Wooden spoon secured before R3 even started. Henry collected golf's least prestigious trophy with the inevitability of gravity.

**The gross Irony:** Third place in gross scoring. THIRD. Last in Stableford, third in strokes. Henry somehow achieved golf's greatest contradiction—simultaneously terrible and respectable. It's a skill. A useless, confusing skill, but a skill nonetheless.

**Signature Moment:** Those five consecutive triple bogeys. They should teach this sequence in golf courses as a cautionary tale. "This is what happens when the universe decides you've had enough happiness for one lifetime."

**Overall Assessment:** Henry proved that golf's dual scoring systems can produce outcomes so absurd they defy logic. Last AND third. Wooden spoon AND bronze gross. He exists in a superposition of success and failure, and we're all worse off for trying to understand it.

**Rating:** 2/10 for Stableford. 6/10 for gross. 11/10 for confusing absolutely everyone.
