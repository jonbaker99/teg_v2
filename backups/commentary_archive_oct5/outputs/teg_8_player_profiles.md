# TEG 8 - Player Profiles & Performance Reviews

*A satirical assessment of individual performances at TEG 8*

## Gregg WILLIAMS - "The Wobbler"
**Final Position:** 1st (Stableford: 149 pts) | 2nd (Gross)

Gregg won his second Trophy through dominance (R1-R2: 38-41), panic (R3: 29), and redemption (R4: 41). Built a 9-point lead, nearly surrendered it with a 29-point wobble, then sealed victory with 41 points when it mattered. Wire-to-wire winner who made it harder than necessary. Second Trophy secured through crisis management.

**Rating:** 10/10 for R1/R2/R4. 3/10 for R3 wobble. 10/10 for recovery.

## Alex BAKER - "The Redeemed"
**Final Position:** 2nd (Stableford: 137 pts, +12) | 5th (Gross)

From last year's wooden spoon to this year's silver medalâ€”Alex completed the redemption arc in style. Posted 33-34-35-29, gradually improving before wobbling in R4 (learned from Gregg). Finished 12 clear of third. Proved wooden spoons aren't destiny.

**Rating:** 8/10 for redemption. 7/10 for performance. 10/10 for improvement trajectory.

## Jon BAKER - "Bronze Again"
**Final Position:** 3rd (Stableford: 131 pts, +18) | 4th (Gross)

Jon collected bronze with 131 points through uninspiring rounds of 34-33-35-29. Never threatened. Never close. Just there, occupying third like someone occupying a bus seat. Professional mediocrity personified.

**Rating:** 5/10 for performance. 2/10 for excitement.

## David MULLIN - "The Seventh"
**Final Position:** 4th (Stableford: 126 pts, +23) | 1st (Gross, **Green Jacket**)

David finished fourth in Stableford and collected his seventh consecutive Green Jacket. The paradox is now routine. Fourth in the actual competition, first in Green Jackets. The streak continues, relentless as taxes.

**Rating:** 4/10 for Stableford. 10/10 for Green Jacket streak.

---

## Henry MELLER - "The Forgotten Fifth"
**Final Position:** 5th (Stableford: 111 pts, +38) | 3rd (Gross)

Henry finished fifth with 111 points through forgettable rounds of 29-28-31-23. Last year's champion reduced to thoroughly irrelevant. Fifth place, thoroughly earned, thoroughly forgotten.

**Rating:** 3/10 for performance. 1/10 for defending title.

---

## Stuart NEUMANN - "The Century"
**Final Position:** 6th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 100 pts, +49) | 6th (Gross)

Stuartposted 100 Stableford points. One hundred. Golf is usually scored out of 72. Stuartapparently didn't get the memo. Rounds of 27-26-23-24 secured the wooden spoon by 11 points. Comprehensively last. Historically bad.

**Rating:** 1/10 for performance. 10/10 for memorable badness.
