# TEG 3 - Player Profiles

---

## Jon BAKER - 1st (Stableford: 164 pts) | 3rd (Gross: 94 strokes, +22)

Jon Baker arrived at TEG 3 with a simple plan: lead from start to finish and never, ever have a Round 3 collapse again. Mission accomplished with all the drama of filling out a spreadsheet.

**The Dominance:** Led for 72 consecutive holes. Seventy-two. That's not winning; that's occupation. That's annexation. Jon didn't so much compete as establish a protectorate and issue building permits.

**The Rounds:** 45-41-35-43. That's not a scoring progression; that's a flat line with occasional bumps. Boring? Absolutely. Effective? Devastatingly so. Jon played golf like someone doing their taxesâ€”methodical, accurate, completely devoid of excitement.

## David MULLIN - 2nd (Stableford: 147 pts, +17) | 1st (Gross: 72 strokes, **Green Jacket**)

David Mullin spent TEG 3 proving a fundamental truth: you don't need birdies when you simply don't make mistakes. Zero birdies in 72 holes. ZERO. And yet he walked away with his second consecutive Green Jacket.

**The Zero-Birdie Masterclass:** Not a single birdie. Seventy-two holes, zero moments of excitement. While Henry was out there collecting four birdies like some sort of show-off, David was grinding out pars and bogeys with the enthusiasm of an accountant auditing tax returns.

**The gross Dominance:** Seventy-two strokes. Twelve clear of second-placed Stuart. This is David's entire brand: birdies are for show; pars are for dough. Entertainment is optional; winning is mandatory.

## Gregg WILLIAMS - 3rd (Stableford: 138 pts, +26) | 5th (Gross: 127 strokes, +55)

Gregg Williams claimed bronze with 138 points through the simple strategy of improving each round until he stopped being terrible and settled for merely mediocre.

**The Start:** Round 1 posted 31 points and six triple bogeys. Six. That's not bad luck; that's a personal relationship with disaster. Gregg opened his tournament by demonstrating exactly how not to play golf.

**The Recovery:** Then something miraculous happened: Gregg remembered how to golf. Rounds of 35-36-36 followed, each one marginally less embarrassing than the last. It's like watching someone learn to walkâ€”inspiring in its own way, but you're mostly just relieved they stopped falling over.

## Henry MELLER - 4th (Stableford: 137 pts, +27) | 4th (Gross: 96 strokes, +24)

Henry Meller played attacking golf at TEG 3 and learned a valuable lesson: sometimes attacking golf just means you lose with more style.

**The Birdie King:** Four birdies across the tournament. FOUR. That's more than everyone else combined. Henry was out here collecting birdies like they were going out of style, which apparently they were because he still finished fourth.

**Round 3 Glory:** Thirty-eight points including three birdies. Best round of the tournament by anyone. For 18 holes, Henry was magnificent. Unfortunately, tournaments last 72 holes, and Henry's other rounds were significantly less magnificent.

## Stuart NEUMANN - 5th (**Wooden Spoon**, Stableford: 135 pts, +29) | 2nd (Gross: 84 strokes, +12)

Stuart Neumann achieved something truly special at TEG 3: finishing last in Stableford while simultaneously claiming second in gross scoring. SchrÃ¶dinger's golferâ€”simultaneously successful and disastrous until you check the scorecard.

**The Wooden Spoon:** One hundred thirty-five points. Last place. Wooden spoon secured. Stuartcollected golf's least prestigious trophy with all the enthusiasm of someone who knows he's also got something good to tell people about.

**The gross Silver:** Eighty-four strokes. Second place. Just 12 behind David's winning score. Respectable. Solid. The kind of performance that suggests competence.
