# TEG 5 Tournament Report: The Paradox

**Return to Algarve, Portugal | June 2012**
**Boavista Golf Course - The Spiritual Home**

Golf is a game of cruel ironies, but rarely has the sport delivered anything quite as perverse as David Mullin's TEG 5 performance. The man claimed his fourth consecutive Green Jacket with dominant gross scoring, finishing 6 strokes clear of the field. And for his troubles? A wooden spoon. Last place in the net competition. Champion and disaster, all in the same weekend.

Welcome to Boavista 2012, where Jon Baker claimed his second TEG Trophy with 156 points (TEG 5 used net vs par scoring, not Stableford), David simultaneously triumphed and bombed, and golf's dual scoring systems delivered their most absurd outcome yet.

## Round 1: Jon Seizes Control

Jon's opening salvo was commanding: 45 points that immediately established a 4-point lead over Gregg Williams. This was championship golf from the off—assured, clinical, establishing dominance before anyone else had settled. Gregg's 41 points claimed second, while Henry (35), Stuart(30), and David (29) trailed in his wake.

The gross competition told David's alternate reality: 21 over par gave him a 3-stroke lead over Henry. This was the David Mullin special—grinding, precise golf that accumulated strokes like a miser counts pennies. But in net scoring, those high numbers meant nothing. Last place after one round, yet leading the gross competition. The irony was already thick.

## Round 2: The Gap Widens

Jon extended his net advantage with another excellent 38-point round—solid rather than spectacular, but more than enough to maintain control. Gregg posted 36 points to stay second, while David delivered a disastrous 30 points that confirmed his wooden spoon status despite posting 24 over in gross—second-best round of the day.

The mathematics were brutal: David was grinding out the Green Jacket while simultaneously cementing last place in the net standings. Henry's 32 points and Stu's 34 points kept them in mid-pack mediocrity, playing their own private battles while the two extremes—Jon's net dominance and David's gross supremacy—played out above and below them.

## Round 3: Jon's Coronation, David's Paradox Deepens

Jon's 38-point Round 3 effectively sealed the TEG Trophy—a comfortable cushion with one round remaining. Gregg's 35 points maintained second place, while Henry (36, including two birdies) climbed into third. Stuart(33) and David (27) brought up the rear, though David's gross scoring dominance continued unabated.

By this stage, the tournament's dual nature had reached peak absurdity: David led the gross standings by 8 strokes, yet trailed the net competition by 33 points. Same player, same course, same golf balls—two entirely different stories.

## Round 4: The Double Decided

Jon's closing 35 points secured a comprehensive victory—156 total, an 11-point margin over Gregg's second-place finish. Four consistent rounds (45, 38, 38, 35) had delivered his second TEG Trophy with minimal drama. This was professional golf: take the lead, extend it, never let go.

Gregg's 37-point finale earned him 145 points and a solid runner-up finish. Henry's 34 points secured third (137 points), while Stu's 38-point flourish lifted him to fourth (135 points). And David? Twenty-six points and a wooden spoon, despite claiming the Green Jacket with 92 strokes—6 clear of second-placed Henry.

## The Final Reckoning

Jon Baker's second TEG Trophy came via the familiar route: wire-to-wire dominance that gave opponents no opportunity for challenge. One hundred fifty-six points in the old net vs par format, built on four rounds of relentless consistency. No eagles, no birdies, just solid golf that accumulated points like compound interest.

Gregg's 145 points earned a career-best second place—his most consistent TEG performance to date. Henry's bronze (137 points, featuring four birdies) and Stu's fourth (135 points) were respectable enough.

And then there was David. Fourth consecutive Green Jacket, first wooden spoon. The greatest and worst performance of his TEG career, simultaneously achieved. Ninety-two gross strokes would have won at most tournaments; in net scoring, they earned him last place. Golf's cruel mathematics laid bare.

## The Verdict

TEG 5 belonged to Jon Baker, whose second TEG Trophy confirmed his status among TEG's elite. But the tournament will be forever remembered for David Mullin's paradox: the wooden spoon Green Jacket winner, a feat so improbable it might never be repeated. Gregg's runner-up finish suggested maturity; Henry and Stu's mid-pack battles provided depth.

Boavista had hosted another TEG. Jon had claimed another trophy. And David had proven that in golf, you can be both champion and catastrophe in the same breath. The sport's beautiful absurdity, perfectly encapsulated.
