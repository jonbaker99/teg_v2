## Main Talking Points

### üéØ Primary Storyline
- **Jon's Redemption:** Wire-to-wire victory (164 pts), led ALL 72 holes
- **The Reversal:** Jon (Trophy) vs David (Green Jacket) - different winners
- **David's Birdies:** ZERO across 4 rounds, still wins Green Jacket by 12 strokes
- **Stu's Paradox:** Wooden spoon (135 pts) BUT 2nd in gross (84 strokes) - the irony

### üèÜ Competition Results
- **TEG Trophy:** Jon (164) by 17 over David (147)
- **Green Jacket:** David (72) by 12 over Stuart(84)
- **Wooden Spoon:** Stuart(135) - but 2nd in gross!

### üìä Round-by-Round
1. **R1:** Jon 45 leads by 8, David 37 (2nd), Henry 33, Stuart32, Gregg 31 (6 triples)
2. **R2:** Jon 41 extends to +15, David 36, Gregg 35, Henry/Stuart32
3. **R3:** Jon 35 maintains +13, David 37, Henry 38 (3 birdies!), Gregg 36, Stuart35
4. **R4:** Jon 43 seals it by 17, David 37, Gregg 36, Henry 35, Stuart36

### üíé Key Moments
- **Jon's Dominance:** Led for ALL 72 holes Stableford, never relinquished control
- **David's Zero-Birdie GJ:** Won gross by 12 without a single birdie - pure grinding
- **Stu's Irony:** Last in points, 2nd in strokes - golf's cruel math
- **Henry's R3:** 38 points with 3 birdies (2 more than anyone), brief glory

### üé≠ Player Stories

**Jon:**
- Redemption after TEG 2's R3 collapse
- Wire-to-wire, never led by less than 13 after R2
- 45-41-35-43: consistent domination
- Second TEG Trophy, establishing elite status

**David:**
- Green Jacket with ZERO birdies in 4 rounds
- 147 Stableford (17 behind Jon) but 72 gross (12 clear)
- The ultimate grinder: mistake-free beats exciting
- 2nd consecutive GJ

**Stu:**
- The wooden spoon paradox
- 135 points = last, 84 strokes = 2nd
- One birdie all tournament
- Proof Stableford and gross tell different stories

**Gregg:**
- Bronze with 138 points (just 1 ahead of Henry)
- Started rough (31 pts, 6 triples R1)
- Improved to 35-36-36
- Zero birdies, solid recovery

**Henry:**
- 4th with 137 (one behind Gregg)
- Four birdies (tournament leader!)
- R3's 38-pointer with 3 birdies = best round
- Attacking golf, not quite enough

### üé™ Humor Angles
- "Spreadsheet golf" - Jon's methodical dominance
- David wins with zero birdies - "accountant's dream"
- Stu's quantum state - last AND second
- Jon led for 72 holes - "occupation, not competition"
- David: "Birdies are for show; pars are for dough"

### üìà Stats Worth Noting
- Jon: Led 72/72 holes Stableford
- David: 0 birdies, 2nd GJ in row
- Henry: 4 birdies (most), but 4th place
- Stu: Last in Stableford, 2nd in gross
- Zero eagles (all tournament)

### üîë Quote-Worthy Lines
- "Led for 72 holes - that's not winning, that's occupation"
- "Zero birdies, one Green Jacket - David's brand of boring excellence"
- "Stu: simultaneously last and second - pick a lane!"
- "Jon didn't win so much as annex the tournament"
- "Birdies are overrated - David Mullin, probably"
