# TEG 6 Tournament Report: Winning While Declining

**First TEG in Spain | Catalonia | September 2013**
**PGA Catalunya Tour Course - Future 2031 Ryder Cup Venue**

Welcome to TEG 6 at PGA Catalunya—the future 2031 Ryder Cup venue and host of multiple European Tour events—where Gregg Williams discovered that you can win while getting progressively worse each round. Forty-eight points (net vs par) in Round 1. Twenty-eight in Round 4. One TEG Trophy. Golf makes no sense.

This was Gregg's first TEG Trophy, achieved with 145 points and a wire-to-wire performance that grew less impressive with each passing round. Jon Baker finished 3 points behind, having closed the gap from 4 to 3 despite Gregg's best efforts to surrender the lead. David Mullin finished fourth in the net competition and collected his fifth consecutive Green Jacket because apparently finishing fourth still counts if you're better at gross scoring.

## The 48-Point Knockout Punch

Let's address the elephant in the room: Gregg's opening 48 points. Forty. Eight. That's not golf; that's a declaration of war. A 4-point lead after one round. Jon posted 44 and was already playing catch-up. The rest were playing for bronze before they'd unpacked.

Forty-eight points should win you a round and demoralize your opponents. It did both. The only problem? Gregg then proceeded to post 36, 33, and 28 in the subsequent rounds, suggesting either fatigue, nerves, or the dawning realization that he'd used up all his golf in Round 1.

## The Backwards Victory

Here's what Gregg Williams did at TEG 6: led after every single round despite getting worse each time. Forty-eight, 36, 33, 28. That's not a scoring progression; that's a controlled descent. By Round 4, Gregg was posting 28 points while Jon posted 26, and somehow that 2-point margin was enough because Gregg had built a cushion with that ridiculous opener.

Jon closed from 4 points behind after Round 2 to 3 points behind at the finish. Not because Jon got better (his 26-point finale was hardly inspiring), but because Gregg got worse slower than Jon got worse. This is what we've come to: winning by declining less rapidly than your opponents.

## David's Fifth Green Jacket From Fourth Place

David Mullin finished fourth in the net competition with 135 points, 10 behind Gregg's winning total. And yet David walked away with his fifth consecutive Green Jacket because gross scoring doesn't care about your net position. Fourth in net, first in strokes. The David Mullin paradox continues, though mercifully this time without the wooden spoon.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** Gregg 48 (HUGE opener, +4 lead), Jon 44, Stuart37, David 35, Henry 28 (already doomed)

**Round 2:** Gregg 36 (extends to +4), Jon 40 (closing), David 37, Stuart36, Henry 31

**Round 3:** Gregg 33 (lead down to 1!), Jon 32, Stuart35, David 32, Henry 34

**Round 4:** Gregg 28 (survives, wins by 3), Jon 26, Stuart31, David 31, Henry 30

## The Verdict

Gregg Williams' first TEG Trophy was achieved through the simple strategy of starting brilliantly and then declining just slowly enough to hold off Jon Baker's equally uninspiring finish. Forty-eight points became 28 over four rounds, yet the trophy was his. Jon's 142 points and second place told the story of a man who closed the gap but ran out of rounds.

Stu's bronze (139 points) was professional. David's fifth consecutive Green Jacket from fourth in net was vintage David—different game, same result. And Henry's wooden spoon (123 points, 22 behind Gregg) marked another tournament on the wrong end of the leaderboard.

PGA Catalunya witnessed its first TEG. The net vs par format continued for two more years (Stableford arrives at TEG 8). And Gregg proved you can win while getting worse, provided you start well enough that "worse" is still better than everyone else's "mediocre."
