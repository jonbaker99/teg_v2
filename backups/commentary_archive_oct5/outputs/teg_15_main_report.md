# TEG 15 Tournament Report: Portugal's Homecoming Champion

**Lisbon Coast, Portugal | October 2022**
**Return to Portugal After COVID | Four Premium Courses: Estoril, West Cliffs, Penha Longa, Oitavos Dunes**
**Post-Pandemic Homecoming**

After two years exiled in England by the pandemic, TEG returned to Portugal's Lisbon Coastâ€”back to the clifftop courses, ocean views, and parkland golf that had defined the tournament before COVID. The homecoming felt right: Oitavos Dunes (Portugal's #1 course), Penha Longa's Sintra mountain views, West Cliffs' modern design, and historic Estoril.

After five runner-up finishes across six tournaments, Gregg Williams finally won his first TEG Trophy with 157 Stableford points, edging David Mullin by 7 points (150). The Green Jacket came with itâ€”48 strokes over par, 10 ahead of second placeâ€”delivering Gregg's first double victory after years of silver medals.

Meanwhile, David Mullin holed his second shot on a par 5 in Round 2 for eagleâ€”the fourth and final eagle in TEG history through 17 tournaments. Across 1,224 holes of golf, only four eagles have been scored. David's came in a losing effort, which is somehow appropriate for golf's rarest achievement.

And Alex Baker collected the wooden spoon one tournament after his brother Jon did the same. The Baker brothers had traded wooden spoons like cursed heirlooms.

## Gregg's Long-Awaited Victory

Five runner-up finishes: TEG 10 (11 behind Alex's 184), TEG 11 (6 behind Jon), TEG 12 (10 behind Patterson), TEG 13 (3 behind Jon), TEG 14 (4 behind David). Then TEG 15 arrived, and Gregg finally converted close into champion.

One hundred fifty-seven Stableford points won by 7 over defending champion David (150). Gregg led after Round 2, extended his advantage in Round 3, cruised home in Round 4. His Round 3 performance at Penha Longa set the course record at 10 over par. The wire-to-wire dominance in gross (48 strokes, 10 ahead of second) suggested Gregg had learned from his runner-up finishes: lead early, extend relentlessly, finish decisively.

Gregg's fourth TEG Trophy (he'd won once before at TEG 6) and first Green Jacket. The perpetual runner-up had finally broken through.

## The Fourth and Final TEG Eagle

Hole 15, Round 2, Portugal. David Mullin holed his second shot on a par 5 for eagle. Two under par. Five Stableford points from a single hole. The fourth eagle in TEG historyâ€”and the last one scored through 17 tournaments.

Four eagles total across 17 tournaments (1,224 holes):
1. Jon Baker (TEG 4, R4 H8, par 4)
2. Stuart Neumann (TEG 12, R4 H15, par 5)
3. John Patterson (TEG 13, R4 H2, par 5)
4. David Mullin (TEG 15, R2 H15, par 5) - **THE LAST EVER**

David's eagle came in Round 2 when he led the tournament by 1 point (76-77 over Gregg after 36 holes). That 5-point hole kept David in contention. Then Gregg pulled away in Rounds 3-4, and David's historic eagle became a footnote in someone else's championship story.

Eagles remain TEG's rarest achievement. Four across 1,224 holes. David's was the last.

## David's Runner-Up Finish

One tournament after winning the double wire-to-wire, David finished runner-up with 150 Stableford points. The eagle in Round 2 kept him competitive. Gregg's relentless accumulation in Rounds 3-4 pulled him clear.

David won zero rounds in either competition (Gregg won all four in gross, three in Stableford). The defending champion finished 7 points back in Stableford, 10 strokes back in gross. Sometimes scoring the tournament's only eagle isn't enough.

## Alex's Wooden Spoon

Alex Baker finished last with 133 Stableford points, one tournament after brother Jon collected his first wooden spoon. The Baker brothers had achieved synchronized mediocrity.

One hundred thirty-three points finished 4 points behind fourth place. Alex never threatened, never led, spent four days being comprehensively worse than everyone except nobody because he was last.

## How It Unfolded

**Round 1:** David 43 leads, Gregg 39, Jon 37, Henry/Alex tied 35

**Round 2:** Gregg 77 (takes lead by 1), David 76 (EAGLE on H15!), Jon 74, Henry 69, Alex 68

**Round 3:** Gregg 118 (extends to +7), David 111, Jon 109, Henry 104, Alex 100 (WS emerging)

**Round 4:** Gregg 157 (seals double by 7), David 150, Jon 144, Henry 137, Alex 133 (WS confirmed)

## The Verdict

TEG 15 delivered Gregg Williams' long-awaited breakthrough: 157 Stableford points and 48 strokes over par, both won decisively after five runner-up finishes. Gregg's first double came through wire-to-wire gross dominance and steady Stableford accumulation.

David Mullin's eagleâ€”the fourth and final in TEG history through 17 tournamentsâ€”made history in a losing effort. Runner-up by 7 points despite holing that par 5 in Round 2.

Alex Baker's wooden spoon (133 points) followed brother Jon's at TEG 14, confirming wooden spoons run in families. Jon's fourth place (144 points) and Henry's fifth (137 points) completed the field.

Gregg had finally converted silver into gold. David had scored the final TEG eagle. Alex had learned what wooden spoons taste like. TEG 15 in summary.
