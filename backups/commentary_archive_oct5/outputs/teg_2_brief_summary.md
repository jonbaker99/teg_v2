# TEG 2 - Brief Summary

**Boavista Golf Course, Lagos, Algarve, Portugal | May 2009**

David Mullin claimed his first TEG Trophy and Green Jacket at Boavista—Howard Swan's championship design that would become TEG's spiritual home—with a commanding wire-to-wire victory, finishing with 103 Stableford points—5 clear of second-placed Jon Baker. After establishing dominance with a 36-point opening round, David briefly surrendered the lead to Baker in Round 2 before delivering a clinical 38-point finale that sealed both titles. The tournament's defining moment came on Round 2's 18th hole, where David, Baker, and Gregg Williams all simultaneously carded triple bogeys or worse—a remarkable synchronized implosion that saw three players score zero Stableford points on a single hole.

Baker's challenge burned bright but brief: a spectacular 37-point Round 2 (including a stunning 24-point front nine) briefly gave him the lead before a disastrous six-triple-bogey final round ended his hopes. Stuart Neumann claimed bronze with steady rounds of 27, 29, and 33 points, also securing second in the gross competition. Gregg Williams struggled to fourth place with 86 points, enduring a grim 8-hole streak of double bogeys or worse, while Henry Meller collected the wooden spoon despite the cruel irony of finishing third in gross scoring.

David's double triumph was defined by his response to adversity—recovering from the 18th hole disaster to produce a flawless final round that showcased the composure of a champion. The first of many titles had arrived.
